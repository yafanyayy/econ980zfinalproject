We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding [ $152 million ], a $1.49 per diluted share benefit as a result of tax reform last year. 
Also, yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a 141st consecutive quarterly dividends of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share for fiscal 2019, an 8.3% increase over fiscal 2018. While [indiscernible] by the quarter-over-quarter changes, operating income in our distribution and pipeline storage segments. I'll touch in a few of the highlights. Contribution margin for distribution segment grows a net 1% or about $4 million, strong consumption driven by colder weather in October and November when by the normalization mechanisms are not yet an effect contributing an incremental $7.7 million. 
Weather 20% colder in the quarter with most [indiscernible] experiencing colder-than-normal condition. 
Solid [indiscernible] customer growth continued, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division, though in the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net [ 36,000 ] customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. This growth contributed incremental $3.7 million of contribution margin. The implementation of tax reform is the [indiscernible] bills more than offset rate increases that were implemented [Audio Gap] in the prior fiscal year and the first quarter, resulting in net $7.3 million increase in customer rates. 
As I said no impact for the segment net income as a result of the corresponding reduction in our effective income tax rate. Operating expenses rose 3.5%. Higher employee-related costs, depreciation and [indiscernible] tax expenses drove this increase. 
In our pipeline and storage segment, contribution margin increased about $9 million. About 2/3 of this increase relates to the new rates that implement approved in the prior fiscal year through APT's 2 GRIP filings. Additionally, stronger transportation margins contributed incremental $3.1 million, net of the impact of our right revenue mechanism as APT continues to benefit from wider spreads. 
The supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin combined the colder weather drove a 12% increase in transportation volumes. Operating expenses for this segment increased $11 million or almost 20%. This increase is focused on pipeline integrity work and reflects the timing of these activities. In the current year quarter, APT accelerate some [indiscernible] testing that new client provided this fiscal year. In the prior year quarter, pipeline [indiscernible] work that had been planned for the first quarter was deferred lagger into fiscal 2018, resulting in a lower-than-normal expense for that quarter. 
Additionally, depreciation and admin belong taxes grow year-over-year due to last year's capital spending. Consolidated capital spending increased 8.7% to [ $460 million ], about 82% of the spending dedicated to safety and reliability projects. Colder wet weather [indiscernible] created challenging conditions which delayed some projects. However, we benefit from having over 6,000 relatively small projects each year that allow us to quickly relocate our spending when we faced these types of challenges. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the year. 
From the financial perspective, we had a very busy quarter. As you can compare, the $1.35 billion in debt and equity financing. And during October, we completed a successful $600 million, 30-year public debt issuance at an interest of 4.3%. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. 
In late November, we issued approximately $750 million of equity. The offering included an equity arrangement that will remain in place through March of 2020. The contemplation of the offering from [indiscernible] approximately $495 million in net proceeds and allocated the remaining $245 million to the forward. 
As of September 21, we got an excess in net proceeds allocated to [indiscernible]. At this time, we anticipate the net proceeds from this [indiscernible] will satisfy our equity needs for fiscal 2019. Additionally, in November, we filed a new $500 million at the market equity issuance program that was [indiscernible] equity needs beyond fiscal 2019. 
As a result of these financing activities, equity capitalization was 59% and we had no short-term debt at quarter-end. We consider the $218 million in cash on hand at the end of December with approximately $1.8 billion in total liquidity available to support our capital spending program. After an exceptionally busy year in fiscal 2018, we completed our fiscal -- we expect our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar to return to a more traditional cadence. To date, we've implemented $21 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and held about $38 million in progress. [indiscernible] generate cases in Kentucky and for about 15% of our Texas customers and annual filings were [indiscernible] serviced area in Louisiana, the City of Dallas and Tennessee highlight the key filings of current in progress. We continue to implement tax reform into customer bills with completion of our Mississippi and Tennessee annual filings during the first quarter. Virginia, as the last date we have not yet incorporated effects of tax reform into our rates but our general rate case in Permian progress will address tax reform. We're now focused on finalizing the refund periods for access deferred taxes. Slide 20 details the progress we have made on tax reform to date. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to this fiscal year. We remain on track to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks."

We remai",1240,"Well, thank you, Chris, for the update on the quarter. It was a very good quarter, and thank you, for those of you who are joining us this morning. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we're off to a very good start for the year. We remain on track to meet our investor -- investment spending goals and our earnings growth target. The 8.7% increase in capital spending during the first quarter demonstrates our team's consistent predictable exposition of our safety investment strategy. In order to sustain this strategy for the long term, which includes increasing our capital spending from $9 billion over the past 10 years, to be in $9 billion to $10 billion over the next 5 years, our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. In the first quarter, we began rolling out new advanced asset data collection technology to field employees and contractors. During construction, crews will collect GPS locations, material, construction methods, operator qualification data, the newly constructed pipeline. This will transform the process of asset data collection, data verification, project closings and the transfer of that key data to backend systems that are used to support operations, maintenance, damage prevention, integrity management and our compliance programs. With thousands of capital projects completed each year, innovations like there's reliability section of our emerging technology, business process change and most importantly, our employees, are certainly game changers on our safety journey. This rollout will continue through this year 2019 and also through 2020. 
This transformational technology is the one example of the many initiatives underway inside the company to scale our capabilities, capture efficiencies and enable our very talented employees to do what they do best, which is investing in safety and conserving our customers and members of the community exceptionally well. 
We're also taking huge steps forward in message of the mitigating with key stakeholders. In the first quarter, we implemented interactive project maps for all of our service areas that are displayed on our company website and show current and recently completed pipe replacement projects, given our customers and other stakeholders access the status update or my projects and their communities, fly down to the street level. For larger projects we now develop customized websites, contact sonic was it, send out mailings and use other channels as needed to most effectively reach our customers. And we're beginning to publish annual operating reports for our regulators and also community leaders. And we meet with officials in the cities we serve to keep them informed about our pipe replacement activity. 
In December, we issued our first corporate responsibility report under the title of an Integrated Annual Report. We also published our first [indiscernible] emissions report. Keeping the key stakeholders informed, the company actions supporting our long-term commitments to good governance on employees, customers, the 1,400 communities we serve and the environment. 
I want to share some of the highlights from these reports. We'd hear the strong corporate government by decision including the focus on thought diversity of the board. Women now hold more than 20% of our board seats. And 3 or 4 directors who joined the board since 2016 are female and minorities. And this year, the board will further strengthen corporate governance by forming a new board committee to oversee the company's corporate responsibility and sustainability. 
In our pursue to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we know that quipping employees with the training tools and support they need to operate safely and contribute at the highest level of essential power success. Employees received more than 53,000 hours of safety training last year and more than 73,000 hours of hands-on technical training and the state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan training center in Plano, which is a site of more than 850,000 hours of training since its opening. In part due to this training, the Osher of recordable employee injuries that decreased 23% since 2013. 
Over the past 5 years, employees also benefited from more than $1 million in higher education assistance received through the company's Robert W [indiscernible] Education Assistance program. Employees continue to reach new heights in building its exceptional customer service, given customers more options and convenience for initiating servers, calling a marble and making a payment arrangement. Our new Spanish-language account center wasn't limited in the past quarter as well as intelligent call routing technology that anticipates customers need and connects them with the most qualified agents. 
And our customers tell us they like what they see. 96% of our customers are satisfied or very satisfied with the interactions with our context center agents and 97% of are satisfied or very satisfied with our on-site technicians. The company contributed $6.1 million to share the board organization last year and that includes $2.7 million that went to help customer in need to our energy assistance program. We'll also work with 400 communities support organizations to give lower income families access to federal home energy assistance plans for it I am particularly proud of the contributions our efficient energy make in the communities in which they operate. Last year, employees contributed $700,000 during our week of giving campaign and volunteered more than 35,000 hours of their own time to help their community. Also highlighted in the report as the work our team does to protect the environment, which has always been important to our company, our employees, our customers and the communities. As a founding member of the EPA's natural gas side mapping challenge program, we work proactively to improve efficiency and reduce methane emissions. Since 2012, we've replaced over 3,500 miles of pipe and we've decreased total emissions through to the use and loss are natural gas by 13.7% in our system. Over the next 5 years, we plan to replace between 5,000 and 6,000 miles of pipeline, including all remaining gas cast iron by 2021, 2 years earlier than originally planned. 
And between 200,000 and 300,000 field service lines. This will reduce methane emissions another 10% to 15%. As we continue to replace infrastructure, we set a goal to reduce our systems methane emissions by 50% by 2035. In addition to pipe line replacement, we're protecting environment in other ways. In 2018, we completed our 9 Leed certified service center and we have 4 more on the way. Over 40% of our customers has signed up for electronic building, one of the highest percentages in the industry, resulting in savings of approximately  152,000 pounds of paper every year. And we partner with municipal solid waste landfill gas producers to transport renewable natural gas to market. And for safety and to best serve our customers, for review and incorporate state-of-the-art equipment for lease detection, monitoring and liquid [indiscernible] prioritization, including the use of 11 advanced mobile the production technology units that are 1,000x more sensitive than traditional technologies. 
In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts. They strive to find ways to improve every day that deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service for the nearly $3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every day focused on safety, by providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. We appreciate your time this morning. We're off to good start for the year.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 pe",977,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding $152 million, a $1.49 per diluted share benefit as a result of implementing tax reform last year. 
Also, yesterday, the board of directors approved the 141st consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share for fiscal 2019, an 8.3% increase over fiscal 2018. Slides 4 and 5 provided details of the quarter-over-quarter changes to operating income for our distribution and pipeline storage segments. I'll touch on a few of the highlights. Contribution margin in our distribution segment grows a net 1% or about $4 million, strong consumption driven by colder weather in October and November when most of weather normalization mechanisms were not yet in effect, contributing an incremental $7.7 million. 
Weather was 20% colder quarter-over-quarter with most of our service areas experiencing colder-than-normal conditions. 
Solid customer growth continued, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division, although in the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 36,000 customers, which represents a 1.1% net customer growth. This growth contributed an incremental $3.7 million of contribution margin. The implementation of tax reform into customer bills more than offset rate increases that were implemented in the prior fiscal year and the first quarter, resulting in net $7.3 million decrease in customer rates. However, this had no material impact to the segment's net income as a result of the corresponding reduction in our effective income tax rate. Operating expenses rose 3.5%. Higher employee-related costs, depreciation and ad valorem tax expenses drove this increase.  
In our pipeline and storage segment, contribution margin increased about $9 million. About 2/3 of this increase relates to new rates that were implement approved in the prior fiscal year through APT's 2 GRIP filings. Additionally, stronger transportation margins contributed incremental $3.1 million, net of the impact to -- of our Rider REV mechanism as APT continues to benefit from wider spreads. 
The supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin combined with colder weather drove a 12% increase in transportation volumes. Operating expenses for this segment increased $11 million or almost 20%. This increase is focused on pipeline integrity work and reflects the timing of these activities. In the current year quarter, APT accelerated some hydrostatic testing that new client provided this fiscal year. In the prior year quarter, pipeline integrity work that had been planned for the first quarter was deferred later into fiscal 2018, resulting in a lower-than-normal expense for that quarter. 
Additionally, depreciation and ad valorem taxes grow year-over-year due to last year's capital spending. Consolidated capital spending increased 8.7% to $416 million, about 82% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. Colder wet weather in some of our service areas created challenging conditions, which delayed some projects. However, we benefit from having over 6,000 relatively small projects each year that allow us to quickly reallocate our spending when we face these types of challenges. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the year. 
From the financing perspective, we had a very busy quarter, as we completed $1.35 billion in debt and equity financing. And early October, we completed a successful $600 million, 30-year public debt issuance at an interest of 4.3%. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. 
In late November, we issued approximately $750 million of equity. The offering included an equity forward arrangement that will remain in place through March of 2020. At contemplation of the offering, we've received approximately $495 million in net proceeds and allocated the remaining $245 million to the forward. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had not accessed the net proceeds allocated to forward. At this time, we anticipate the net proceeds from this issuance will satisfy our equity needs for fiscal 2019. Additionally, in November, we filed a new $500 million at-the-market equity issuance program that will support our equity needs beyond fiscal 2019. 
As a result of these financing activities, our equity to total capitalization was 59%, and we had no short-term debt at quarter-end. We can consider the $218 million in cash on hand at the end of December, we have approximately $1.8 billion in total equity available to support our capital spending program. After an exceptionally busy year, in fiscal 2018, we completed our fiscal -- we expect our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar to return to a more traditional cadence. To date, we've implemented $21 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $38 million in progress. General rate cases in Kentucky and for about 15% of our Texas customers and annual filings for TransLa service area in Louisiana, the City of Dallas and Tennessee highlight the key filings that are currently in progress. We continue to implement tax reform into customer bills with completion of our Mississippi and Tennessee annual filings during the first quarter. Virginia, as the last date, we have not yet incorporated the effects of tax reform into our rates, but our general rate case currently in progress will address tax reform. We're now focused on finalizing the refund periods for our excess deferred taxes. Slide 20 details the progress we have made on tax reform to date. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year. We remain on track to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike, for some closing remarks."

We r",1234,"Well, thank you, Chris, for the update on the quarter. And it was a very good quarter, and thank you, for those of you, who are joining us this morning. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we're off to a very good start to the year. We remain on track to meet our investor -- investment spending goals and our earnings growth targets. The 8.7% increase in capital spending during the first quarter demonstrates our team's consistent, predictable execution of our safety investment strategy. In order to sustain this strategy for the long term, which includes increasing our capital spending from $9 billion, over the past 10 years, to go in $9 billion to $10 billion over the next 5 years, our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. In the first quarter, we began rolling out new advanced asset data collection technology to field employees and contractors. During construction, crews will collect GPS locations, material, construction methods, operator qualification data for newly constructed pipeline. This will transform the process of asset data collection, data verification, project closings and the transfer of that key data to back-end systems that are used to support operations, maintenance, damage prevention, integrity management and our compliance programs. With thousands of capital projects completed each year, innovations like this that lie at the intersection of emerging technology, business process change and most importantly, our employees, are certainly game changers on our safety journey. This rollout will continue through this year 2019 and also through 2020. 
This transformational technology is the one example of the many initiatives underway inside the company to scale our capabilities, capture efficiencies and enable our very talented employees to do what they do best, which is investing in safety and serving our customers and members of the community exceptionally well. 
We're also taking huge steps forward in methods of communicating with key stakeholders. In the first quarter, we implemented interactive project maps for all of our service areas that are displayed on our company's website and show current and recently completed pipe replacement projects, giving our customers and other stakeholders' access to status updates about projects in their communities right down to the street level. For larger projects, we now develop customized websites, conduct door-to-door visits, send out mailings and use other channels, as needed, to most effectively reach our customers. And we're beginning to publish annual operating reports for our regulators and also community leaders. And we meet with officials in the cities we serve to keep them informed of our pipe replacement activity. 
In December, we issued our first corporate responsibility report under the title of an Integrated Annual Report. We also published our first methane emissions report. Keeping key stakeholders informed, the company actions supporting our long-term commitments to good governance, our employees, customers, the 1,400 communities we serve and the environment. 
I want to share some of the highlights from these reports. We adhere to strong corporate governance practices including a focus on thought diversity at the board. Women now hold more than 20% of our board seats, and 3 or 4 directors who joined the board since 2016 are female or minorities. And this year, the board will further strengthen corporate governance by forming a new board committee to oversee the company's corporate responsibility and sustainability. 
And our pursuit to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we know that equipping employees with the training tools and support they need to operate safely and contribute at the highest level essential to our success. Employees received more than 53,000 hours of safety training last year and more than 73,000 hours of hands-on technical training in the state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan training center in Plano, which is a site of more than 850,000 hours of training since its opening. In part due to this training, the OSHA rate of recordable employee injuries has decreased 23% since 2013. 
Over the past 5 years, employees also benefited from more than $1 million in higher education assistance received through the company's Robert W. Best Education Assistance Program. Employees continue to reach new heights in delivering exceptional customer service giving customers more options and convenience when initiating service, calling about a bill or making a payment arrangement. A new Spanish language account center was implemented in the past quarter as well as intelligent call routing technology that anticipates customers' needs and connects them with the most qualified agents. 
And our customers tell us they like what they see. 96% of our customers are satisfied or very satisfied with their interactions with our contact center agents and 97% are satisfied or very satisfied with our on-site technicians. The company contributed $6.1 million to charitable organizations last year and that includes $2.7 million that went to help customers in need to our Energy Assistance Program. We're also working with 400 community support organizations to give low income families access to federal home energy assistance funds. But I am particularly proud of the contributions our Atmos Energy employees make in the communities, in which they operate. Last year, employees contributed $700,000 during our week of giving campaign and volunteered more than 35,000 hours of their own time to help their community. Also highlighted in the report is the work our team does to protect the environment, which has always been important to our company, our employees, our customers and the communities. As a founding member of the EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program, we work proactively to improve efficiency and reduce methane emissions. Since 2012, we've replaced over 3,500 miles of pipe, and we've decreased total emissions due to the use and loss with natural gas by 13.7% in our system. Over the next 5 years, we plan to replace between 5,000 and 6,000 miles of pipeline including all remaining cast iron by 2021, 2 years earlier than originally planned and between 200,000 and 300,000 field service lines. This will reduce methane emissions another 10% to 15%. As we continue to replace infrastructure, we set a goal to reduce our system's methane emissions by 50% by 2035. In addition to pipeline replacement, we're protecting the environment in other ways. In 2018, we completed our 9th LEED-certified service center and we have 4 more underway. Over 40% of our customers has signed up for electronic billing, one of the highest percentages in the industry, resulting in savings of approximately 152,000 pounds of paper every year. And we partner with municipal solid waste landfill gas producers to transport renewable natural gas to market. And for safety and to best serve our customers, we review and incorporate state-of-the-art equipment for leaks detection, monitoring and leak repair prioritization, including the use of 11 advanced mobile leak production technology units that are 1,000x more sensitive than traditional technologies. 
In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts. They strive to find ways to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service for the nearly $3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every day, focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. We appreciate your time this morning. We're off to a good start for the year. 
And now we'll take any questions you may have."

As we've said in the past, it's difficult to predict really beyond the current quarter.

And as you know and a lot of our transport opportunities are opportunistic, as we serve primarily our firm supply customers, which would be the LDCs in our -- on system industrials. And as we get into the summer months, as we saw in the last -- or summer -- last summer, we do an awful lot of maintenance on the pipeline when we're in the off-peak season. So we're not going to get into the prediction for the rest of the year. We're happy we gotten off to a good start and had this opportunity.

Again, it's really difficult right now to -- it's being folded in jurisdiction by jurisdiction. For example, as I mentioned, Mississippi and Tennessee just started, the Tennessee was in mid-October, Mississippi was in the first of November, West Texas and Mid-Tex RRMs were in October, so I understand the modeling could be a little bit challenging. But I think the information on Slide 20 is ought to give you a pretty good indication of how that's going to flow back. And at the end of the day with -- it's actually fully implemented and embraced, we expect our customers to benefit more than $125 million per year.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 pe",980,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding $162 million, a $1.49 per diluted share benefit as a result of implementing tax reform last year. 
Also, yesterday, the board of directors approved the 141st consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share for fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. Slides 4 and 5 provide details of the quarter-over-quarter changes to operating income for our distribution and pipeline storage segments. I'll touch on a few of the highlights. Contribution margin in our distribution segment rose a net 1% or about $4 million, strong consumption driven by colder weather in October and November when most of weather normalization mechanisms were not yet in effect, contributing an incremental $7.7 million. 
Weather was 20% colder quarter-over-quarter with most of our service areas experiencing colder-than-normal conditions. 
Solid customer growth continued, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 36,000 customers, which represents a 1.1% net customer growth. This growth contributed an incremental $3.7 million to contribution margin. The implementation of tax reform into customer bills more than offset rate increases that were implemented in the prior fiscal year and the first quarter, resulting in net $7.3 million decrease in customer rates. However, this had no material impact to the segment's net income as a result of the corresponding reduction in our effective income tax rate. Operating expenses rose 3.5%. Higher employee-related costs, depreciation and ad valorem tax expenses drove this increase.  
In our pipeline and storage segment, contribution margin increased about $9 million. About 2/3 of this increase relates to new rates that were implement approved in the prior fiscal year through APT's 2 GRIP filings. Additionally, stronger transportation margins contributed incremental $3.1 million, net of the impact to -- of our Rider REV mechanism as APT continues to benefit from wider spreads. 
The supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin combined with colder weather drove a 12% increase in transportation volumes. Operating expenses for this segment increased $11 million or almost 20%. This increase is focused on pipeline integrity work and reflects the timing of these activities. In the current year quarter, APT accelerated some hydrostatic testing that new client provided this fiscal year. In the prior year quarter, pipeline integrity work that had been planned for the first quarter was deferred later into fiscal 2018, resulting in a lower-than-normal expense for that quarter. 
Additionally, depreciation and ad valorem taxes rose year-over-year due to last year's capital spending. Consolidated capital spending increased 8.7% to $416 million, about 82% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. Cold and wet weather in some of our service areas created challenging conditions, which delayed some projects. However, we benefit from having over 6,000 relatively small projects each year that allow us to quickly reallocate our spending when we face these types of challenges. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the year. 
From the financing perspective, we had a very good, very busy quarter, as we completed $1.35 billion in debt and equity financing. And early October, we completed a successful $600 million, 30-year public debt issuance at an interest of 4.3%. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. 
In late November, we issued approximately $750 million of equity. The offering included an equity forward arrangement that will remain in place through March of 2020. At contemplation of the offering, we've received approximately $495 million in net proceeds and allocated the remaining $245 million to the forward. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had not accessed the net proceeds allocated to the forward. At this time, we anticipate the net proceeds from this issuance will satisfy our equity needs for fiscal 2019. Additionally, in November, we filed a new $500 million at-the-market equity issuance program that will support our equity needs beyond fiscal 2019. 
As a result of these financing activities, our equity to total capitalization was 59%, and we had no short-term debt at quarter-end. We can consider the $218 million in cash on hand at the end of December, we have approximately $1.8 billion in total equity available to support our capital spending program. After an exceptionally busy year, in fiscal 2018, we completed our fiscal -- we expect our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar to return to a more traditional cadence. To date, we've implemented $21 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $38 million in progress. General rate cases in Kentucky and for about 15% of our Texas customers and annual filings for TransLa service area in Louisiana, the City of Dallas and Tennessee highlight the key filings that are currently in progress. We continue to implement tax reform into customer bills with completion of our Mississippi and Tennessee annual filings during the first quarter. Virginia is the last stage we have not yet incorporated the effects of tax reform into our rates, but our general rate case currently in progress will address tax reform. We're now focused on finalizing the refund periods for our excess deferred taxes. Slide 20 details the progress we have made on tax reform to date. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year. We remain on track to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike, for some closing remarks."

We r",1233,"Well, thank you, Chris, for the update on the quarter. And it was a very good quarter, and thank you, for those of you, who are joining us this morning. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we're off to a very good start to the year. We remain on track to meet our investor -- investment spending goals and our earnings growth targets. The 8.7% increase in capital spending during the first quarter demonstrates our team's consistent, predictable execution of our safety investment strategy. In order to sustain this strategy for the long term, which includes increasing our capital spending from $9 billion, over the past 10 years, to brand $9 billion to $10 billion over the next 5 years, our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. In the first quarter, we began rolling out new advanced asset data collection technology to field employees and contractors. During construction, crews will collect GPS locations, material, construction methods, operator qualification data for newly constructed pipeline. This will transform the process of asset data collection, data verification, project closings and the transfer of that key data to back-end systems that are used to support operations, maintenance, damage prevention, integrity management and our compliance programs. With thousands of capital projects completed each year, innovations like this that lie at the intersection of emerging technology, business process change and most importantly, our employees, are certainly game changers on our safety journey. This rollout will continue through this year 2019 and also through 2020. 
This transformational technology is the one example of the many initiatives underway inside the company to scale our capabilities, capture efficiencies and enable our very talented employees to do what they do best, which is investing in safety and serving our customers and members of the community exceptionally well. 
We're also taking huge steps forward in methods of communicating with key stakeholders. In the first quarter, we implemented interactive project maps for all of our service areas that are displayed on our company's website and show current and recently completed pipe replacement projects, giving our customers and other stakeholders' access to status updates about projects in their communities right down to the street level. For larger projects, we now develop customized websites, conduct door-to-door visits, send out mailings and use other channels, as needed, to most effectively reach our customers. And we're beginning to publish annual operating reports for our regulators and also community leaders. And we meet with officials in the cities we serve to keep them informed of our pipe replacement activity. 
In December, we issued our first corporate responsibility report under the title of an Integrated Annual Report. We also published our first methane emissions report. Keeping key stakeholders informed, the company actions supporting our long-term commitments to good governance, our employees, customers, the 1,400 communities we serve and the environment. 
I want to share some of the highlights from these reports. We adhere to strong corporate governance practices including a focus on thought diversity at the board. Women now hold more than 20% of our board seats, and 3 or 4 directors who joined the board since 2016 are female or minorities. And this year, the board will further strengthen corporate governance by forming a new board committee to oversee the company's corporate responsibility and sustainability. 
And our pursuit to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we know that equipping employees with the training tools and support they need to operate safely and contribute at the highest level essential to our success. Employees received more than 53,000 hours of safety training last year and more than 73,000 hours of hands-on technical training in the state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan training center in Plano, which is a site of more than 850,000 hours of training since its opening. In part due to this training, the OSHA rate of recordable employee injuries has decreased 23% since 2013. 
Over the past 5 years, employees also benefited from more than $1 million in higher education assistance received through the company's Robert W. Best Education Assistance Program. Employees continue to reach new heights in delivering exceptional customer service giving customers more options and convenience when initiating service, calling about a bill or making a payment arrangement. A new Spanish language account center was implemented in the past quarter as well as intelligent call routing technology that anticipates customers' needs and connects them with the most qualified agents. 
And our customers tell us they like what they see. 96% of our customers are satisfied or very satisfied with their interactions with our contact center agents and 97% are satisfied or very satisfied with our on-site technicians. The company contributed $6.1 million to charitable organizations last year and that includes $2.7 million that went to help customers in need through our Energy Assistance Program. We're also working with 400 community support organizations to give low income families access to federal home energy assistance funds. But I am particularly proud of the contributions our Atmos Energy employees make in the communities, in which they operate. Last year, employees contributed $700,000 during our week of giving campaign and volunteered more than 35,000 hours of their own time to help their community. Also highlighted in the report is the work our team does to protect the environment, which has always been important to our company, our employees, our customers and the communities. As a founding member of the EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program, we work proactively to improve efficiency and reduce methane emissions. Since 2012, we've replaced over 3,500 miles of pipe, and we've decreased total emissions due to the use and loss of natural gas by 13.7% in our system. Over the next 5 years, we plan to replace between 5,000 and 6,000 miles of pipeline including all remaining cast iron by 2021, 2 years earlier than originally planned and between 200,000 and 300,000 field service lines. This will reduce methane emissions another 10% to 15%. As we continue to replace infrastructure, we set a goal to reduce our system's methane emissions by 50% by 2035. In addition to pipeline replacement, we're protecting the environment in other ways. In 2018, we completed our 9th LEED-certified service center and we have 4 more underway. Over 40% of our customers has signed up for electronic billing, one of the highest percentages in the industry, resulting in savings of approximately 152,000 pounds of paper every year. And we partner with municipal solid waste landfill gas producers to transport renewable natural gas to market. And for safety and to best serve our customers, we review and incorporate state-of-the-art equipment for leak detection, monitoring and leak repair prioritization, including the use of 11 advanced mobile leak detection technology units that are 1,000x more sensitive than traditional technologies. 
In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts. They strive to find ways to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service for the nearly $3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every day, focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. We appreciate your time this morning. We're off to a good start for the year.

As we've said in the past, it's difficult to predict really beyond the current quarter.

And as you know and a lot of our transport opportunities are opportunistic, as we serve primarily our firm supply customers, which would be the LDCs in our -- on system industrials. And as we get into the summer months, as we saw in the last -- or summer -- last summer, we do an awful lot of maintenance on the pipeline when we're in the off-peak season.

For example, as I mentioned, Mississippi and Tennessee just started, the Tennessee was in mid-October, Mississippi was in the 1st of November, West Texas and Mid-Tex RRMs were in October, so I understand the modeling could be a little bit challenging.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding $162 million, a $1.49 per diluted share benefit as a result of implementing tax reform last year. 
Also, yesterday, the board of directors approved the 141st consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share for fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. Slides 4 and 5 provide details of the quarter-over-quarter changes to operating income for our distribution and pipeline storage segments. I'll touch on a few of the highlights. Contribution margin in our distribution segment rose a net 1% or about $4 million, strong consumption driven by colder weather in October and November when most of weather normalization mechanisms were not yet in effect, contributing an incremental $7.7 million. 
Weather was 20% colder quarter-over-quarter with most of our service areas experiencing colder-than-normal conditions. 
Solid customer growth continued, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 36,000 customers, which represents a 1.1% net customer growth. This growth contributed an incremental $3.7 million to contribution margin. The implementation of tax reform into customer bills more than offset rate increases that were implemented in the prior fiscal year and the first quarter, resulting in net $7.3 million decrease in customer rates. However, this had no material impact to the segment's net income as a result of the corresponding reduction in our effective income tax rate. Operating expenses rose 3.5%. Higher employee-related costs, depreciation and ad valorem tax expenses drove this increase. 
In our pipeline and storage segment, contribution margin increased about $9 million. About 2/3 of this increase relates to new rates that were implement approved in the prior fiscal year through APT's 2 GRIP filings. Additionally, stronger transportation margins contributed incremental $3.1 million, net of the impact to -- of our Rider REV mechanism as APT continues to benefit from wider spreads. 
The supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin combined with colder weather drove a 12% increase in transportation volumes. Operating expenses for this segment increased $11 million or almost 20%. This increase is focused on pipeline integrity work and reflects the timing of these activities. In the current year quarter, APT accelerated some hydrostatic testing that new client provided this fiscal year. In the prior year quarter, pipeline integrity work that had been planned for the first quarter was deferred later into fiscal 2018, resulting in a lower-than-normal expense for that quarter. 
Additionally, depreciation and ad valorem taxes rose year-over-year due to last year's capital spending. Consolidated capital spending increased 8.7% to $416 million, about 82% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. Cold and wet weather in some of our service areas created challenging conditions, which delayed some projects. However, we benefit from having over 6,000 relatively small projects each year that allow us to quickly reallocate our spending when we face these types of challenges. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the year. 
From the financing perspective, we had a very good, very busy quarter, as we completed $1.35 billion in debt and equity financing. And early October, we completed a successful $600 million, 30-year public debt issuance at an interest of 4.3%. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. 
In late November, we issued approximately $750 million of equity. The offering included an equity forward arrangement that will remain in place through March of 2020. At contemplation of the offering, we've received approximately $495 million in net proceeds and allocated the remaining $245 million to the forward. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had not accessed the net proceeds allocated to the forward. At this time, we anticipate the net proceeds from this issuance will satisfy our equity needs for fiscal 2019. Additionally, in November, we filed a new $500 million at-the-market equity issuance program that will support our equity needs beyond fiscal 2019. 
As a result of these financing activities, our equity to total capitalization was 59%, and we had no short-term debt at quarter-end. We can consider the $218 million in cash on hand at the end of December, we have approximately $1.8 billion in total equity available to support our capital spending program. After an exceptionally busy year, in fiscal 2018, we completed our fiscal -- we expect our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar to return to a more traditional cadence. To date, we've implemented $21 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $38 million in progress. General rate cases in Kentucky and for about 15% of our Texas customers and annual filings for TransLa service area in Louisiana, the City of Dallas and Tennessee highlight the key filings that are currently in progress. We continue to implement tax reform into customer bills with completion of our Mississippi and Tennessee annual filings during the first quarter. Virginia is the last stage we have not yet incorporated the effects of tax reform into our rates, but our general rate case currently in progress will address tax reform. We're now focused on finalizing the refund periods for our excess deferred taxes. Slide 20 details the progress we have made on tax reform to date. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year. We remain on track to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike, for some closing remarks."

We r",1233,"Well, thank you, Chris, for the update on the quarter. And it was a very good quarter, and thank you, for those of you, who are joining us this morning. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we're off to a very good start to the year. We remain on track to meet our investor -- investment spending goals and our earnings growth targets. The 8.7% increase in capital spending during the first quarter demonstrates our team's consistent, predictable execution of our safety investment strategy. In order to sustain this strategy for the long term, which includes increasing our capital spending from $9 billion, over the past 10 years, to brand $9 billion to $10 billion over the next 5 years, our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. In the first quarter, we began rolling out new advanced asset data collection technology to field employees and contractors. During construction, crews will collect GPS locations, material, construction methods, operator qualification data for newly constructed pipeline. This will transform the process of asset data collection, data verification, project closings and the transfer of that key data to back-end systems that are used to support operations, maintenance, damage prevention, integrity management and our compliance programs. With thousands of capital projects completed each year, innovations like this that lie at the intersection of emerging technology, business process change and most importantly, our employees, are certainly game changers on our safety journey. This rollout will continue through this year 2019 and also through 2020. 
This transformational technology is the one example of the many initiatives underway inside the company to scale our capabilities, capture efficiencies and enable our very talented employees to do what they do best, which is investing in safety and serving our customers and members of the community exceptionally well. 
We're also taking huge steps forward in methods of communicating with key stakeholders. In the first quarter, we implemented interactive project maps for all of our service areas that are displayed on our company's website and show current and recently completed pipe replacement projects, giving our customers and other stakeholders' access to status updates about projects in their communities right down to the street level. For larger projects, we now develop customized websites, conduct door-to-door visits, send out mailings and use other channels, as needed, to most effectively reach our customers. And we're beginning to publish annual operating reports for our regulators and also community leaders. And we meet with officials in the cities we serve to keep them informed of our pipe replacement activity. 
In December, we issued our first corporate responsibility report under the title of an Integrated Annual Report. We also published our first methane emissions report. Keeping key stakeholders informed, the company actions supporting our long-term commitments to good governance, our employees, customers, the 1,400 communities we serve and the environment. 
I want to share some of the highlights from these reports. We adhere to strong corporate governance practices including a focus on thought diversity at the board. Women now hold more than 20% of our board seats, and 3 or 4 directors who joined the board since 2016 are female or minorities. And this year, the board will further strengthen corporate governance by forming a new board committee to oversee the company's corporate responsibility and sustainability. 
And our pursuit to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we know that equipping employees with the training tools and support they need to operate safely and contribute at the highest level essential to our success. Employees received more than 53,000 hours of safety training last year and more than 73,000 hours of hands-on technical training in the state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan training center in Plano, which is a site of more than 850,000 hours of training since its opening. In part due to this training, the OSHA rate of recordable employee injuries has decreased 23% since 2013. 
Over the past 5 years, employees also benefited from more than $1 million in higher education assistance received through the company's Robert W. Best Education Assistance Program. Employees continue to reach new heights in delivering exceptional customer service giving customers more options and convenience when initiating service, calling about a bill or making a payment arrangement. A new Spanish language account center was implemented in the past quarter as well as intelligent call routing technology that anticipates customers' needs and connects them with the most qualified agents. 
And our customers tell us they like what they see. 96% of our customers are satisfied or very satisfied with their interactions with our contact center agents and 97% are satisfied or very satisfied with our on-site technicians. The company contributed $6.1 million to charitable organizations last year and that includes $2.7 million that went to help customers in need through our Energy Assistance Program. We're also working with 400 community support organizations to give low income families access to federal home energy assistance funds. But I am particularly proud of the contributions our Atmos Energy employees make in the communities, in which they operate. Last year, employees contributed $700,000 during our week of giving campaign and volunteered more than 35,000 hours of their own time to help their community. Also highlighted in the report is the work our team does to protect the environment, which has always been important to our company, our employees, our customers and the communities. As a founding member of the EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program, we work proactively to improve efficiency and reduce methane emissions. Since 2012, we've replaced over 3,500 miles of pipe, and we've decreased total emissions due to the use and loss of natural gas by 13.7% in our system. Over the next 5 years, we plan to replace between 5,000 and 6,000 miles of pipeline including all remaining cast iron by 2021, 2 years earlier than originally planned and between 200,000 and 300,000 field service lines. This will reduce methane emissions another 10% to 15%. As we continue to replace infrastructure, we set a goal to reduce our system's methane emissions by 50% by 2035. In addition to pipeline replacement, we're protecting the environment in other ways. In 2018, we completed our 9th LEED-certified service center and we have 4 more underway. Over 40% of our customers has signed up for electronic billing, one of the highest percentages in the industry, resulting in savings of approximately 152,000 pounds of paper every year. And we partner with municipal solid waste landfill gas producers to transport renewable natural gas to market. And for safety and to best serve our customers, we review and incorporate state-of-the-art equipment for leak detection, monitoring and leak repair prioritization, including the use of 11 advanced mobile leak detection technology units that are 1,000x more sensitive than traditional technologies. 
In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts. They strive to find ways to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service for the nearly $3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every day, focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. We appreciate your time this morning. We're off to a good start for the year. 
And now we'll take any questions you may have."

As we've said in the past, it's difficult to predict really beyond the current quarter. We do know that there is additional pipeline capacity expected to come on into service at the end of calendar year. And so we would expect that, that would normalize pricing a little bit. And as you know and a lot of our transport opportunities are opportunistic, as we serve primarily our firm supply customers, which would be the LDCs in our -- on system industrials. And as we get into the summer months, as we saw in the last -- or summer -- last summer, we do an awful lot of maintenance on the pipeline when we're in the off-peak season. So we're not going to get into the prediction for the rest of the year. We're happy we gotten off to a good start and had this opportunity. And again, as you know and others know, that 3 quarters of any benefits beyond the Rider REV benchmark flow back to our care of customers, which is -- creates yet another opportunity to keep customers' bills low."

For example, as I mentioned, Mississippi and Tennessee just started, the Tennessee was in mid-October, Mississippi was in the 1st of November, West Texas and Mid-Tex RRMs were in October, so I understand the modeling could be a little bit challenging.

We appreciate your interest at Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $250 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings excluded $4 million benefit related to the invitation of tax reform. Year-to-date, earnings were $333 million or $3.21 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $327 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And adjusted earnings excluded a $166 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. 
Also yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a 142nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share in fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The recovery of the capital spending required to modernize our natural gas delivery network, continued customer growth and a planned increase in safety-related operating expenses were the primary drivers of the quarter's results. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few highlights. 
In the second quarter, operating income of distribution segment increased 8% to $229 million. Recovery provided by recent regulatory actions increased contribution margin by $24 million. Additionally, we continue to expand solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, we added a net 37,000 new customers, which represents 1.2% growth. We continue to experience strong customer growth in several of our service areas, including the DFW Metroplex, the severance of natural into the north of Austin and the like of Kansas to the Western Kansas City. This growth added $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and almost $8 million year-to-date. 
However, despite weather that was 9% colder than the prior year quarter, customer conception declined due to varying weather patterns quarter-over-quarter, which reduced contribution margin by about $9 million. 
Operating expenses decreased by about 1%. In the prior year quarter, we incurred $23 million related to customer assistance and other nonrecurring expenses related to the outage in Northwest Dallas. After adjusting for these expenses, operating expenses increased approximately 9%. More than half of this increase reflects higher depreciation and ad valorem taxes driven by last year's capital spending. The remaining increase led to a planned increase in system integrity and maintenance work such as digital mapping of legacy assets and work to mitigate and reduce third-party damage to our system. 
Additionally, we experienced higher labor and training because as we have added service technicians and service specialists to support our Mid-Tex operations in the DFW Metroplex. 
Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment increased about 16% to $69 million during the second quarter. Near rates from our last year's group filing contributed $12 million of this growth. Additionally, APT continued to benefit from the supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin. APTs through system revenue increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $4.5 million year-to-date, net underwriting rev mechanism. APT's tariff customers continue to benefit from this mechanism while our distribution customers in Texas received the benefit of low cost of gas produced in this region. 
Operating expenses increased $6 million or about 9%. About half of this increase reflects higher depreciation expense as a result of last year's capital spending. Additionally, we plan for incremental pipeline integrity work, which was the primary driver for the remainder of the increase in operating expenses.
Consolidated capital spending increased 12% to $778 million year-to-date. About 84% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the fiscal year. 
From a financing perspective, we had another busy quarter as we completed over $600 million of financing. We refinanced our $450 million 8.5% 10-year notes with a 4.125% 30-year notes. As a result of the financing, our overall cost decreased to 4.6% and our weighted average maturity increased to 22 years. Additionally, as most of you are aware, we moved to the S&P 500 from the S&P mid-cap 400 in mid-February. We took advantage of this unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue 1 million shares to explore shares arrangement executed under ACM program.
The net proceeds of $159 million from this forward sales arrangements were used towards our equity needs for fiscal 2020 and will not be fully diluted until issued in fiscal 2020. These net proceeds, combined with the $245 million in net proceeds issued under forward sales arrangements during our November equity issuance, leases just under $400 million to help fund our capital spending through March 31, 2020, when all of these forward sales arrangements mature. 
Based on the execution of these forward arrangements, there were many availability under our ATM program and our current capital spending outlook, we do not perceive the need for discrete equity issuance through the end of fiscal 2020. 
As a result of our financing activities this year, our equity and total capitalization was 60% and our short-term debt balance was 0 at quarter end. Including the $108 million in cash on hand at the end of March and the $404 million in net proceeds available under the forward sales arrangements, we have approximately $2.1 billion of total available liquidity. After resetting most of our regulatory mechanisms last year, our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar has returned to a more traditional cadence. To date, we had met an $86 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $90 million in progress. 
Our annual filings in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the most of these filings. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to comment on our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance. Yesterday, we narrowed our guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Slides 12 and 13 provide additional details of our updated guidance. 
Earnings for the first half of fiscal year were in line with our expectations. We see potential for a modest uptick in APT contribution margins as a result of the supply and demand dynamics back in the Permian basin. However, as we've communicated before, [indiscernible] focused on preparing APT to winter operations for the next fiscal year and we do not expect the impact to be material. 
Additionally, we have completed our fiscal 2019 financing program and we now have clarity on how those financing will impact fiscal 2019 results. 
Finally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated several efforts that will further mitigate long-term risk. Following the incident in New England last fall, we are now assessing our low pressure systems and implementing additional procedures to continue to safely manage these systems. 
Additionally, during the first half of fiscal year, we initiated a multiyear effort to implement new leak detection technology. The preliminary results of the initial pilot efforts have been encouraging, and we'll continue to methodically implement this technology in certain of our jurisdictions during the second half of the fiscal year. 
And in the second half of fiscal year, we are planning to run additional in line inspections in our pipeline storage segment to facilitate capital allocation decisions for fiscal 2020 and beyond. Our performance for the first half of fiscal year in addition to clarity we have for the second half of the fiscal year is well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks. Mike?"

Our results for the first half of the fiscal year reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of the investments we are making in safety and reliability of our system while continuing to mitigate long-term risk. 
Capital spending increased 12% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. As we planned to increase our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023, we're also investing at our people and technology to support these higher spending levels. 
Last fall, we started to implement new technology that will digitally capture all the data work required to collect and retain for compliance purposes. We've completed the rollout to about 20% of the nearly 1,000 company and contractor crews within our system. We're on track to expand the rollout to about 50% of these crews by fiscal year-end. This is just one example of the various initiatives we have underway to build scale and efficiency to sustain our ability to invest in safety and reliability. 
During the first half of the fiscal year, we also continued to find ways to mitigate risk for the long term. The increased O&M spending that Chris referred to in the second half of the fiscal year for low-pressure system assessment, systematic rollout of new leak survey technology and in line inspections in our transmission system will help us implement new procedures and technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system and support our risk-based capital allocation program. This spending does not affect our anticipated 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth through fiscal 2023. 
Additionally, as Chris mentioned, our move to the S&P 500 created an unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue equity under forward sales arrangements through our ATM that will be used toward our fiscal 2020 equity need. These are just a couple of examples of how we remain agile when conditions evolve to mitigate operational and execution risk for the long term. These equity forward arrangements, combined with the additional $1.8 billion of debt and equity financing, further strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capacity necessary to finance our capital spending plans over the next 5 years. 
As we look toward the back half of the fiscal year, we have more clarity around our regulatory outcomes, our O&M spending and our financing costs. This clarity gives us the confidence to tighten our EPS guidance range to $4.25 to $4.35, which leaves us well positioned to meet our earnings per share growth targets for fiscal 2019. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued outstanding efforts. Our highly qualified gas professionals come to work every day, laser-focused on safety while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. 
We are accomplishing these critical services while striving to improve every day as we deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service for the nearly 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8 state footprint. We certainly appreciate your time this morning, and we'll take any questions you may have. Kevin?"

When we had the opportunity presented to us that was unplanned when we moved to the S&P 500 in February, we issued $160 million under our ATM under forward sales arrangements. So we had a total of $404 million in total forward arrangements available to us through the end of March of 2020. And we'll take that down over that next, basically, over the next 11 to 12 months based on our cash needs.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per",1282,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings excluded $4 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Year-to-date, earnings were $373 million or $3.21 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $327 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And adjusted earnings excluded a $166 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Also yesterday, the Board of Directors approved our 142nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share in fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The recovery of the capital spending required to modernize our natural gas delivery network, continued customer growth and a planned increase in safety-related operating expenses were the primary drivers of the quarter's results. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few highlights. 
In the second quarter, operating income in the distribution segment increased 8% to $229 million. Recovery provided by recent regulatory actions increased contribution margin by $24 million. Additionally, we continued to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, we added a net 37,000 new customers, which represents 1.2% growth. We continued to experience strong customer growth in several of our service areas, including the DFW Metroplex, the suburbs of Nashville and to the north of Austin and the left of Kansas to the Western Kansas City. This growth added $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and almost $8 million year-to-date. However, despite weather that was 9% colder than the prior year quarter, customer consumption declined due to varying weather patterns quarter-over-quarter, which reduced contribution margin by about $9 million. 
Operating expenses decreased by about 1%. In the prior year quarter, we incurred $23 million related to customer assistance and other nonrecurring expenses related to the outage in Northwest Dallas. After adjusting for these expenses, operating expenses increased approximately 9%. More than half this increase reflects higher depreciation and ad valorem taxes driven by last year's capital spending. The remaining increase led to a planned increase in system integrity and maintenance work, such as digital mapping of legacy assets and work to mitigate and reduce third-party damage to our system. Additionally, we experienced higher labor and training costs as we have added service technicians and leak survey specialists to support our Mid-Tex operations in the DFW Metroplex. 
Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment increased about 16% to $69 million during the second quarter. New rates from our last year's GRIP filing contributed $12 million of this growth. Additionally, APT continued to benefit from the supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin. APTs through-system revenue increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $4.5 million year-to-date, net of the Rider REV mechanism. APT's tariff customers continue to benefit from this mechanism, while our distribution customers in Texas receive the benefit of low cost of gas produced in this region. 
Operating expenses increased $6 million or about 9%. About half of this increase reflects higher depreciation expense as a result of last year's capital spending. Additionally, we plan for incremental pipeline integrity work, which was the primary driver for the remainder of the increase in operating expenses. 
Consolidated capital spending increased 12% to $778 million year-to-date. About 84% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the fiscal year. 
From a financing perspective, we had another busy quarter as we completed over $600 million of financing. We refinanced our $450 million 8.5% 10-year notes with a 4.125% 30-year notes. As a result of the financing, our overall cost of debt decreased to 4.6%, and our weighted average maturities increased to 22 years. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, we moved to the S&P 500 from the S&P MidCap 400 in mid-February. We took advantage of this unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue 1 million shares through forward sales arrangement executed under our ATM program. The net proceeds of $159 million from this forward sales arrangements were used towards our equity needs for fiscal 2020 and will not be fully diluted until issued in fiscal 2020. These net proceeds, combined with the $245 million in net proceeds issued under forward sales arrangements during our November equity issuance leaves us with just over $400 million to help fund our capital spending through March 31 of 2020, when all of these forward sales arrangements mature. Based on the execution of these forward arrangements, the remaining availability under our ATM program and our current capital spending outlook, we do not perceive a need for a discrete equity issuance through the end of fiscal 2020. 
As a result of our financing activities this year, our equity and total capitalization was 60% and our short-term debt balance was 0 at quarter end. Including the $108 million in cash on-hand at the end of March and the $404 million in net proceeds available under the forward sales arrangements, we have approximately $2.1 billion of total available liquidity. 
After resetting most of our regulatory mechanisms last year, our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar has returned to a more traditional cadence. To date, we had met an $86 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $90 million in progress. Our annual filings in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the most significant of these filings. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to comment on our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance. Yesterday, we narrowed our guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Slides 12 and 13 provide additional details of our updated guidance. 
Earnings in the first half of fiscal year were in line with our expectations. We see potential for a modest uptick in APT contribution margins as a result of the supply-and-demand dynamics back in the Permian Basin. However, as we have communicated before, summer months are focused on preparing APT for winter operations for the next fiscal year, and we do not expect the impact to be material. 
Additionally, we have completed our fiscal 2019 financing program and we now have clarity on how those -- that financing will impact fiscal 2019 results. 
Finally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated several efforts that will further mitigate long-term risk. Following the incident in New England last fall, we are now assessing our low-pressure systems and implementing additional procedures to continue to safely manage these systems. Additionally, during the first half of fiscal year, we initiated a multiyear effort to implement new leak detection technology. The preliminary results of the initial pilot efforts have been encouraging, and we'll continue to methodically implement this technology in certain of our jurisdictions during the second half of the fiscal year. And in the second half of fiscal year, we are planning to run additional in-line inspections in our pipeline and storage segment to facilitate capital allocation decisions for fiscal 2020 and beyond. 
Our performance for the first half of fiscal year and the additional clarity we have for the second half of the fiscal year leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks. Mike?"

Our results for the first half of the fiscal year reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of the investments we're making in safety and reliability of our system while continuing to mitigate long-term risk. Capital spending increased 12% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. As we plan to increase our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023, we're also investing at our people and technology to support these higher spending levels. Last fall, we started to implement new technology that will digitally capture all the data work we're required to collect and retain for compliance purposes. We've completed the rollout to about 20% of the nearly 1,000 company and contractor crews working our system. We're on track to expand the rollout to about 50% of these crews by fiscal year-end. This is just one example of the various initiatives we have underway to build scale and efficiency to sustain our ability to invest in safety and reliability. 
During the first half of the fiscal year, we also continued to find ways to mitigate risk for the long term. The increased O&M spending that Chris referred to in the second half of the fiscal year for low-pressure system assessment, systematic rollout of new leak survey technology and in-line inspections at our transmission system will help us implement new procedures and technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system and support our risk-based capital allocation program. This spending does not affect our anticipated 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth through fiscal 2023. 
Additionally, as Chris mentioned, our move to the S&P 500 created an unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue equity under forward sales arrangements through our ATM that will be used toward our fiscal 2020 equity needs. These are just a couple of examples of how we remain agile when conditions evolve to mitigate operational and execution risk for the long term. These equity forward arrangements, combined with the additional $1.8 billion of debt and equity financing, further strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capacity necessary to finance our capital spending plans over the next 5 years. 
As we look toward the back half of the fiscal year, we have more clarity around our regulatory outcomes, our O&M spending and our financing costs. This clarity gives us the confidence to tighten our EPS guidance range to $4.25 to $4.35, which leaves us well positioned to meet our earnings per share growth targets for fiscal 2019. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued outstanding efforts. Our highly qualified gas professionals come to work every day, laser-focused on safety while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. 
We're accomplishing these critical services while striving to improve every day as we deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service for the nearly 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. 
We certainly appreciate your time this morning, and we'll take any questions you may have. Kevin?"

And our plan was to draw down the $245 million between January of 2019 and March 31 of 2020. When we had the opportunity presented to us that was unplanned when we moved to the S&P 500 in February, we issued $160 million under our ATM under forward sales arrangements. So we have a total of $404 million in total forward arrangements available to us through the end of March of 2020.

We share common interest certainly in replacing aging infrastructure, and we've been investing for many, many years in Dallas. And we expect to reach agreement in some point in time in the future.
Our company has made $119 million of infrastructure improvements in the City of Dallas during that test year.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per",1280,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings exclude a $4 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Year-to-date, earnings were $373 million or $3.21 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $327 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And adjusted earnings exclude a $166 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Also yesterday, the Board of Directors approved our 142nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share in fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The recovery of the capital spending required to modernize our natural gas delivery network, continued customer growth and a planned increase in safety-related operating expenses were the primary drivers of the quarter's results. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few highlights. 
In the second quarter, operating income in our distribution segment increased 8% to $229 million. Recovery provided by recent regulatory actions increased contribution margin by $24 million. Additionally, we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, we added a net 37,000 new customers, which represents 1.2% growth. We continue to experience strong customer growth in several of our service areas, including the DFW Metroplex, the suburbs of Nashville and to the north of Austin and Olathe, Kansas, to the west of Kansas City. This growth added $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and almost $8 million year-to-date. However, despite weather that was 9% colder than the prior year quarter, customer consumption declined due to varying weather patterns quarter-over-quarter, which reduced contribution margin by about $9 million. 
Operating expenses decreased by about 1%. In the prior year quarter, we incurred $23 million related to customer assistance and other nonrecurring expenses related to the outage in Northwest Dallas. After adjusting for these expenses, operating expenses increased approximately 9%. More than half this increase reflects higher depreciation and ad valorem taxes driven by last year's capital spending. The remaining increase led to a planned increase in system integrity and maintenance work, such as digital mapping of legacy assets and work to mitigate and reduce third-party damage to our system. Additionally, we experienced higher labor and training costs as we have added service technicians and leak survey specialists to support our Mid-Tex operations in the DFW Metroplex. 
Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment increased about 16% to $69 million during the second quarter. New rates from our last year's GRIP filing contributed $12 million of this growth. Additionally, APT continued to benefit from the supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin. APTs through-system revenue increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $4.5 million year-to-date, net of the Rider REV mechanism. APT's tariff customers continue to benefit from this mechanism, while our distribution customers in Texas receive the benefit of low cost of gas produced in this region. 
Operating expenses increased $6 million or about 9%. About half of this increase reflects higher depreciation expense as a result of last year's capital spending. Additionally, we plan for incremental pipeline integrity work, which was the primary driver for the remainder of the increase in operating expenses. 
Consolidated capital spending increased 12% to $778 million year-to-date. About 84% of this spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the fiscal year. 
From a financing perspective, we had another busy quarter as we completed over $600 million of financing. We refinanced our $450 million 8.5% 10-year notes with 4.125% 30-year notes. As a result of the financing our overall cost of debt decreased to 4.6% and our weighted average maturity increased to 22 years. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, we moved to the S&P 500 from the S&P MidCap 400 in mid-February. We took advantage of this unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue 1.0 million shares through forward sales arrangements executed under our ATM program. The net proceeds of $159 million from these forward sales arrangements we'll use towards our equity needs for fiscal 2020 and will not be fully diluted until issued in fiscal 2020. These net proceeds, combined with the $245 million in net proceeds issued under forward sales arrangements during our November equity issuance, leaves us with just over $400 million to help fund our capital spending through March 31 of 2020, when all of these forward sales arrangements mature. Based on the execution of these forward arrangements, the remaining availability under our ATM program and our current capital spending outlook, we do not perceive a need for a discrete equity issuance through the end of fiscal 2020. 
As a result of our financing activities this year, our equity and total capitalization was 60% and our short-term debt balance was 0 at quarter end. Including the $108 million in cash on-hand at the end of March and the $404 million in net proceeds available under the forward sales arrangements, we have approximately $2.1 billion of total available liquidity. 
After resetting most of our regulatory mechanisms last year, our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar has returned to a more traditional cadence. To date, we have implemented $86 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $90 million in progress. Our annual filings in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the most significant of these filings. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to comment on our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance. Yesterday, we narrowed our guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Slides 12 and 13 provide additional details of our updated guidance. 
Earnings for the first half of fiscal year were in line with our expectations. We see potential for a modest uptick in APT contribution margins as a result of the supply-and-demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin. However, as we have communicated before, summer months are focused on preparing APT for winter operations for the next fiscal year, and we do not expect the impact to be material. 
Additionally, we have completed our fiscal 2019 financing program and we now have clarity on how those -- that financing will impact fiscal 2019 results. 
Finally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated several efforts that will further mitigate long-term risk. Following the incident in New England last fall, we are now assessing our low-pressure systems and implementing additional procedures to continue to safely manage these systems. Additionally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated a multiyear effort to implement new leak detection technology. The preliminary results of the initial pilot efforts have been encouraging, and we'll continue to methodically implement this technology in certain of our jurisdictions during the second half of the fiscal year. And in the second half of fiscal year, we are planning to run additional in-line inspections in our pipeline and storage segment to facilitate capital allocation decisions for fiscal 2020 and beyond. 
Our performance for the first half of fiscal year and the additional clarity we have for the second half of the fiscal year leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks. Mike?"

Our results for the first half of the fiscal year reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of the investments we're making in safety and reliability of our system while continuing to mitigate long-term risk. Capital spending increased 12% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. As we plan to increase our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023, we're also investing in our people and technology to support these higher spending levels. Last fall, we started to implement new technology that will digitally capture all the data we're required to collect and retain for compliance purposes. We've completed the rollout to about 20% of the nearly 1,000 company and contractor crews working on our system. We're on track to expand the rollout to about 50% of these crews by fiscal year-end. This is just one example of the various initiatives we have underway to build scale and efficiency to sustain our ability to invest in safety and reliability. 
During the first half of the fiscal year, we also continued to find ways to mitigate risk for the long term. The increased O&M spending that Chris referred to in the second half of the fiscal year for low-pressure system assessment, systematic rollout of new leak survey technology and in-line inspections on our transmission system will help us implement new procedures and technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system and support our risk-based capital allocation program. This spending does not affect our anticipated 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth through fiscal 2023. 
Additionally, as Chris mentioned, our move to the S&P 500 created an unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue equity under forward sales arrangements through our ATM that will be used toward our fiscal 2020 equity needs. These are just a couple of examples of how we remain agile when conditions evolve to mitigate operational and execution risk for the long term. These equity forward arrangements, combined with the additional $1.8 billion of debt and equity financing, further strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capacity necessary to finance our capital spending plans over the next 5 years. 
As we look toward the back half of the fiscal year, we have more clarity around our regulatory outcomes, our O&M spending and our financing costs. This clarity gives us the confidence to tighten our EPS guidance range to $4.25 to $4.35, which leaves us well positioned to meet our earnings per share growth targets for fiscal 2019. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued outstanding efforts. Our highly qualified gas professionals come to work every day, laser-focused on safety while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. 
They're accomplishing these critical services while striving to improve every day as we deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service for the nearly 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint.

And so Chris, backing up to November, there was a $748 million total equity issuance, of which $500 million before costs were taken into the first quarter. $245 million was allocated to forward sales arrangements that expire in March of 2020. And our plan was to draw down to $245 million between January of 2019 and March 31 of 2020. When we had the opportunity presented to us that was unplanned when we moved to the S&P 500 in February, we issued $160 million under our ATM under forward sales arrangements.

And we've kind of reaffirmed and reviewed all of our procedures, recommunicated them. We've created geofencing in our GIS systems. So when there are line locates called that are anywhere near our low-pressure systems, we'll have individuals from the company there to monitor any construction or digging near our assets. And then this review of our system design will then guide our next set of actions, which may involve bifurcating those systems or providing -- putting other kind of technical solutions like slam-shut devices or additional releases on, based on the needs. So we're well along that process and we expect that -- we haven't seen anything that concerns us at this time."

The city staff, we've been working with them and their consultants and representatives, and they've acknowledged efforts on both sides to try to reach an agreement. However, we haven't been able to do so in time for their needed approval. So the staff's recommended that the City Council deny the request. Now that denial would trigger an appeal process to the Railroad Commission, which we've been down that path before. And our plan is to continue to work with the city. We share common interests certainly in replacing aging infrastructure, and we've been investing for many, many years in Dallas. And we expect to reach agreement in some point in time in the future.
Our company has made $119 million of infrastructure improvements in the city of Dallas during that test year. And we also agreed to accelerate our cast-iron replacement at the city's request to 2021, getting the last of that removed in 2021 versus 2023.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings exclude a $4 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Year-to-date, earnings were $373 million or $3.21 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $327 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And adjusted earnings exclude a $166 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Also yesterday, the Board of Directors approved our 142nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share in fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The recovery of the capital spending required to modernize our natural gas delivery network, continued customer growth and a planned increase in safety-related operating expenses were the primary drivers of the quarter's results. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few highlights. 
In the second quarter, operating income in our distribution segment increased 8% to $229 million. Recovery provided by recent regulatory actions increased contribution margin by $24 million. Additionally, we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, we added a net 37,000 new customers, which represents 1.2% growth. We continue to experience strong customer growth in several of our service areas, including the DFW Metroplex, the suburbs of Nashville and to the north of Austin and Olathe, Kansas, to the west of Kansas City. This growth added $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and almost $8 million year-to-date. However, despite weather that was 9% colder than the prior year quarter, customer consumption declined due to varying weather patterns quarter-over-quarter, which reduced contribution margin by about $9 million. 
Operating expenses decreased by about 1%. In the prior year quarter, we incurred $23 million related to customer assistance and other nonrecurring expenses related to the outage in Northwest Dallas. After adjusting for these expenses, operating expenses increased approximately 9%. More than half this increase reflects higher depreciation and ad valorem taxes driven by last year's capital spending. The remaining increase led to a planned increase in system integrity and maintenance work, such as digital mapping of legacy assets and work to mitigate and reduce third-party damage to our system. Additionally, we experienced higher labor and training costs as we have added service technicians and leak survey specialists to support our Mid-Tex operations in the DFW Metroplex. 
Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment increased about 16% to $69 million during the second quarter. New rates from our last year's GRIP filing contributed $12 million of this growth. Additionally, APT continued to benefit from the supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin. APTs through-system revenue increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $4.5 million year-to-date, net of the Rider REV mechanism. APT's tariff customers continue to benefit from this mechanism, while our distribution customers in Texas receive the benefit of low cost of gas produced in this region. 
Operating expenses increased $6 million or about 9%. About half of this increase reflects higher depreciation expense as a result of last year's capital spending. Additionally, we plan for incremental pipeline integrity work, which was the primary driver for the remainder of the increase in operating expenses. 
Consolidated capital spending increased 12% to $778 million year-to-date. About 84% of this spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the fiscal year. 
From a financing perspective, we had another busy quarter as we completed over $600 million of financing. We refinanced our $450 million 8.5% 10-year notes with 4.125% 30-year notes. As a result of the financing our overall cost of debt decreased to 4.6% and our weighted average maturity increased to 22 years. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, we moved to the S&P 500 from the S&P MidCap 400 in mid-February. We took advantage of this unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue 1.0 million shares through forward sales arrangements executed under our ATM program. The net proceeds of $159 million from these forward sales arrangements we'll use towards our equity needs for fiscal 2020 and will not be fully diluted until issued in fiscal 2020. These net proceeds, combined with the $245 million in net proceeds issued under forward sales arrangements during our November equity issuance, leaves us with just over $400 million to help fund our capital spending through March 31 of 2020, when all of these forward sales arrangements mature. Based on the execution of these forward arrangements, the remaining availability under our ATM program and our current capital spending outlook, we do not perceive a need for a discrete equity issuance through the end of fiscal 2020. 
As a result of our financing activities this year, our equity and total capitalization was 60% and our short-term debt balance was 0 at quarter end. Including the $108 million in cash on-hand at the end of March and the $404 million in net proceeds available under the forward sales arrangements, we have approximately $2.1 billion of total available liquidity. 
After resetting most of our regulatory mechanisms last year, our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar has returned to a more traditional cadence. To date, we have implemented $86 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $90 million in progress. Our annual filings in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the most significant of these filings. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to comment on our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance. Yesterday, we narrowed our guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Slides 12 and 13 provide additional details of our updated guidance. 
Earnings for the first half of fiscal year were in line with our expectations. We see potential for a modest uptick in APT contribution margins as a result of the supply-and-demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin. However, as we have communicated before, summer months are focused on preparing APT for winter operations for the next fiscal year, and we do not expect the impact to be material. 
Additionally, we have completed our fiscal 2019 financing program and we now have clarity on how those -- that financing will impact fiscal 2019 results. 
Finally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated several efforts that will further mitigate long-term risk. Following the incident in New England last fall, we are now assessing our low-pressure systems and implementing additional procedures to continue to safely manage these systems. Additionally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated a multiyear effort to implement new leak detection technology. The preliminary results of the initial pilot efforts have been encouraging, and we'll continue to methodically implement this technology in certain of our jurisdictions during the second half of the fiscal year. And in the second half of fiscal year, we are planning to run additional in-line inspections in our pipeline and storage segment to facilitate capital allocation decisions for fiscal 2020 and beyond. 
Our performance for the first half of fiscal year and the additional clarity we have for the second half of the fiscal year leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks. Mike?"

Our results for the first half of the fiscal year reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of the investments we're making in safety and reliability of our system while continuing to mitigate long-term risk. Capital spending increased 12% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. As we plan to increase our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023, we're also investing in our people and technology to support these higher spending levels. Last fall, we started to implement new technology that will digitally capture all the data we're required to collect and retain for compliance purposes. We've completed the rollout to about 20% of the nearly 1,000 company and contractor crews working on our system. We're on track to expand the rollout to about 50% of these crews by fiscal year-end. This is just one example of the various initiatives we have underway to build scale and efficiency to sustain our ability to invest in safety and reliability. 
During the first half of the fiscal year, we also continued to find ways to mitigate risk for the long term. The increased O&M spending that Chris referred to in the second half of the fiscal year for low-pressure system assessment, systematic rollout of new leak survey technology and in-line inspections on our transmission system will help us implement new procedures and technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system and support our risk-based capital allocation program. This spending does not affect our anticipated 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth through fiscal 2023. 
Additionally, as Chris mentioned, our move to the S&P 500 created an unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue equity under forward sales arrangements through our ATM that will be used toward our fiscal 2020 equity needs. These are just a couple of examples of how we remain agile when conditions evolve to mitigate operational and execution risk for the long term. These equity forward arrangements, combined with the additional $1.8 billion of debt and equity financing, further strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capacity necessary to finance our capital spending plans over the next 5 years. 
As we look toward the back half of the fiscal year, we have more clarity around our regulatory outcomes, our O&M spending and our financing costs. This clarity gives us the confidence to tighten our EPS guidance range to $4.25 to $4.35, which leaves us well positioned to meet our earnings per share growth targets for fiscal 2019. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued outstanding efforts. Our highly qualified gas professionals come to work every day, laser-focused on safety while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. 
They're accomplishing these critical services while striving to improve every day as we deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service for the nearly 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. 
We certainly appreciate your time this morning, and we'll take any questions you may have. Kevin?"

And our plan was to draw down to $245 million between January of 2019 and March 31 of 2020. When we had the opportunity presented to us that was unplanned when we moved to the S&P 500 in February, we issued $160 million under our ATM under forward sales arrangements. So we have a total of $404 million in total forward arrangements available to us through the end of March of 2020. And we'll take that down over that next -- basically, over the next 11 to 12 months based on our cash needs.

We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per",1280,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings of $175 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings exclude a $4 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Year-to-date, earnings were $373 million or $3.21 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $327 million or $2.97 per diluted share. And adjusted earnings exclude a $166 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Also yesterday, the Board of Directors approved our 142nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share in fiscal 2019, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The recovery of the capital spending required to modernize our natural gas delivery network, continued customer growth and a planned increase in safety-related operating expenses were the primary drivers of the quarter's results. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few highlights. 
In the second quarter, operating income in our distribution segment increased 8% to $229 million. Recovery provided by recent regulatory actions increased contribution margin by $24 million. Additionally, we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, we added a net 37,000 new customers, which represents 1.2% growth. We continue to experience strong customer growth in several of our service areas, including the DFW Metroplex, the suburbs of Nashville and to the north of Austin and Olathe, Kansas, to the west of Kansas City. This growth added $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and almost $8 million year-to-date. However, despite weather that was 9% colder than the prior year quarter, customer consumption declined due to varying weather patterns quarter-over-quarter, which reduced contribution margin by about $9 million. 
Operating expenses decreased by about 1%. In the prior year quarter, we incurred $23 million related to customer assistance and other nonrecurring expenses related to the outage in Northwest Dallas. After adjusting for these expenses, operating expenses increased approximately 9%. More than half this increase reflects higher depreciation and ad valorem taxes driven by last year's capital spending. The remaining increase led to a planned increase in system integrity and maintenance work, such as digital mapping of legacy assets and work to mitigate and reduce third-party damage to our system. Additionally, we experienced higher labor and training costs as we have added service technicians and leak survey specialists to support our Mid-Tex operations in the DFW Metroplex. 
Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment increased about 16% to $69 million during the second quarter. New rates from our last year's GRIP filing contributed $12 million of this growth. Additionally, APT continued to benefit from the supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin. APTs through-system revenue increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $4.5 million year-to-date, net of the Rider REV mechanism. APT's tariff customers continue to benefit from this mechanism, while our distribution customers in Texas receive the benefit of low cost of gas produced in this region. 
Operating expenses increased $6 million or about 9%. About half of this increase reflects higher depreciation expense as a result of last year's capital spending. Additionally, we plan for incremental pipeline integrity work, which was the primary driver for the remainder of the increase in operating expenses. 
Consolidated capital spending increased 12% to $778 million year-to-date. About 84% of this spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the fiscal year. 
From a financing perspective, we had another busy quarter as we completed over $600 million of financing. We refinanced our $450 million 8.5% 10-year notes with 4.125% 30-year notes. As a result of the financing our overall cost of debt decreased to 4.6% and our weighted average maturity increased to 22 years. 
Additionally, as most of you are aware, we moved to the S&P 500 from the S&P MidCap 400 in mid-February. We took advantage of this unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue 1.0 million shares through forward sales arrangements executed under our ATM program. The net proceeds of $159 million from these forward sales arrangements we'll use towards our equity needs for fiscal 2020 and will not be fully diluted until issued in fiscal 2020. These net proceeds, combined with the $245 million in net proceeds issued under forward sales arrangements during our November equity issuance, leaves us with just over $400 million to help fund our capital spending through March 31 of 2020, when all of these forward sales arrangements mature. Based on the execution of these forward arrangements, the remaining availability under our ATM program and our current capital spending outlook, we do not perceive a need for a discrete equity issuance through the end of fiscal 2020. 
As a result of our financing activities this year, our equity and total capitalization was 60% and our short-term debt balance was 0 at quarter end. Including the $108 million in cash on-hand at the end of March and the $404 million in net proceeds available under the forward sales arrangements, we have approximately $2.1 billion of total available liquidity. 
After resetting most of our regulatory mechanisms last year, our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar has returned to a more traditional cadence. To date, we have implemented $86 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $90 million in progress. Our annual filings in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the most significant of these filings. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to comment on our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance. Yesterday, we narrowed our guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Slides 12 and 13 provide additional details of our updated guidance. 
Earnings for the first half of fiscal year were in line with our expectations. We see potential for a modest uptick in APT contribution margins as a result of the supply-and-demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin. However, as we have communicated before, summer months are focused on preparing APT for winter operations for the next fiscal year, and we do not expect the impact to be material. 
Additionally, we have completed our fiscal 2019 financing program and we now have clarity on how those -- that financing will impact fiscal 2019 results. 
Finally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated several efforts that will further mitigate long-term risk. Following the incident in New England last fall, we are now assessing our low-pressure systems and implementing additional procedures to continue to safely manage these systems. Additionally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated a multiyear effort to implement new leak detection technology. The preliminary results of the initial pilot efforts have been encouraging, and we'll continue to methodically implement this technology in certain of our jurisdictions during the second half of the fiscal year. And in the second half of fiscal year, we are planning to run additional in-line inspections in our pipeline and storage segment to facilitate capital allocation decisions for fiscal 2020 and beyond. 
Our performance for the first half of fiscal year and the additional clarity we have for the second half of the fiscal year leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks. Mike?"

Our results for the first half of the fiscal year reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of the investments we're making in safety and reliability of our system while continuing to mitigate long-term risk. Capital spending increased 12% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. As we plan to increase our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023, we're also investing in our people and technology to support these higher spending levels. Last fall, we started to implement new technology that will digitally capture all the data we're required to collect and retain for compliance purposes. We've completed the rollout to about 20% of the nearly 1,000 company and contractor crews working on our system. We're on track to expand the rollout to about 50% of these crews by fiscal year-end. This is just one example of the various initiatives we have underway to build scale and efficiency to sustain our ability to invest in safety and reliability. 
During the first half of the fiscal year, we also continued to find ways to mitigate risk for the long term. The increased O&M spending that Chris referred to in the second half of the fiscal year for low-pressure system assessment, systematic rollout of new leak survey technology and in-line inspections on our transmission system will help us implement new procedures and technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system and support our risk-based capital allocation program. This spending does not affect our anticipated 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth through fiscal 2023. 
Additionally, as Chris mentioned, our move to the S&P 500 created an unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue equity under forward sales arrangements through our ATM that will be used toward our fiscal 2020 equity needs. These are just a couple of examples of how we remain agile when conditions evolve to mitigate operational and execution risk for the long term. These equity forward arrangements, combined with the additional $1.8 billion of debt and equity financing, further strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capacity necessary to finance our capital spending plans over the next 5 years. 
As we look toward the back half of the fiscal year, we have more clarity around our regulatory outcomes, our O&M spending and our financing costs. This clarity gives us the confidence to tighten our EPS guidance range to $4.25 to $4.35, which leaves us well positioned to meet our earnings per share growth targets for fiscal 2019. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued outstanding efforts. Our highly qualified gas professionals come to work every day, laser-focused on safety while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. 
They're accomplishing these critical services while striving to improve every day as we deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service for the nearly 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint.

And so Chris, backing up to November, there was a $748 million total equity issuance, of which $500 million before costs were taken into the first quarter. $245 million was allocated to forward sales arrangements that expire in March of 2020. And our plan was to draw down to $245 million between January of 2019 and March 31 of 2020. When we had the opportunity presented to us that was unplanned when we moved to the S&P 500 in February, we issued $160 million under our ATM under forward sales arrangements. So we have a total of $404 million in total forward arrangements available to us through the end of March of 2020.

However, we haven't been able to do so in time for their needed approval. So the staff's recommended that the City Council deny the request.

We share common interests certainly in replacing aging infrastructure, and we've been investing for many, many years in Dallas. And we expect to reach agreement in some point in time in the future.
Our company has made $119 million of infrastructure improvements in the city of Dallas during that test year.

In Investor Relations, nothing says happy birthday more than hosting an earnings call. So congratulations. 
Yesterday, we reported our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, and I'm pleased to report that we are on track to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.35, an increase earnings per share for the 17th consecutive year. 
Capital spending increased 10% during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. Approximately, 87% of this spending is on safety and reliability investment. As we continue to execute our risk-based capital spending program, the modernize and distribution and transmission system. 
To June 30 2019, we compared to $2.1 billion of financing, which is supported our fiscal 2019 capital spending, further strengthened our balance sheet, lowered the cost of financing for our customers and leaves us very well-positioned to maintain our credit ratings for long term. 
We continue to invest in technology, our people and processes to achieve operating excellence and scale our capabilities, to sustain our safety driven strategies, with the team we have in place for extremely well-positioned for continued success into the future. 
Yesterday, we announced that I'll step down from my role as President and Chief Executive Officer effective September 30 to focus on my health. I'll reman with the company to the end of the calendar year to support the transition, and I'll retire from the company and plan to step down from the Board effective January 1 of 2020. Also, announced yesterday is the Kevin Akers, currently Executive Vice President, has been appointed by the Board to succeed me as the President and CEO and become a member of the Board effective October 1 of this year. Kim [indiscernible] will continue as Executive Chairman. 
Now this was a very ethical decision for me, but it's the decision right for the company, for me and for my family. I've been facing a recent health issues, at to this point, has alluded as definitive diagnosis. I'm extremely optimistic this will resolve the self favorably in the long run, however, it's requiring an increasing in my time and necessitates me pulling back on the commitment. This decision was made much, much easier for me by th efact that Kevin Akers has raised the a assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin's is a proven leader with broad company and industry experience, the majority of the nearly 29 years with the company, has been in senior leadership position. He has deep operating experience, having previously served for over 9 years as President of our Kentucky Mid-Tex
Mid-Tex Division, 5 years as President of our Mississippi division and more recently, took down responsibility for the company's pipeline and storage operations. 
For the past several years, Kevin also oversaw our pipeline safety, supply chain and customer service function. And he is been instrumental in driving the process improvement and technology initiatives that has enabled the company to scale its operation to sustain our success. Many of you already know Kevin from our Analyst Day in the past 2 years as well as the AGA financial in the investor conferences this year. Kevin is surrounded by a very seasoned senior leadership team. Chris and the rest of our management committee will continue in their current roles. They were closely together for many, many years, and even prior to being on the management committee. Not only are they respected colleagues, but they're also friends. And Kevin has the full support over 4,700 employees. 
One of our board's most important responsibilities is success planning. And they've done that masterfully over our 36 years of an independent public company. This succession plan is been in place for several years and just as with prior transitions from our founder, Charlie Barns, to [indiscernible], to Kim [indiscernible], to me. The transition to Kevin will be completely seamless. 
As I mentioned earlier Kim will continue in the role of Executive Chairman. I'll be forever great leader, as a mentor and a friend. His continued involvement in a company's as a Chairman as well as adviser to Kevin and the rest of the management committee will provide further insurance of the company's continued success. 
And lastly, before I turn the call over to Chris for the financial update, I'd like to thank the investors and analysts that have had the distinct pleasure to get to know the past 4 years. Their support an investment in time and capital has been so critical for the success over safety investment strategy. their insights and challenging questions that made us a better company and it may be a better leader. I'd also like to thank our 4,700 employees for their continued outstanding efforts to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service for the 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. they come to work every single day focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service and executing our capital spending program focused on modernizing our system. It's been my greatest honor to share alongside for the past 11 years. They are the reason that Atmos Energy will continue to be successful for a long term.

Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. 
Year-to-date, net income was $453 million or $3.88 per diluted share compared with $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Fiscal 2018 year-to-date results include a $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share, nonrecurring income tax benefit and tax reform. Excluding the tax benefits, adjusted net income was $398 million or $2.60 per diluted share. 
Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations that made the drivers underlying our performance during the first half of the year continuing into the third quarter. Slides 5 and 6 provide details for our quarter and year-to-date results. I will touch in few of the highlights. 
In our distribution segment, operating income increased -- $4 million to $48.7 million in the third quarter, as the modest increased cost in margin was offset by a higher operating expenses. 
Contribution margin increased [ to up ] $1 million quarter-over-quarter. W expensed the $7 million increase to new rates and nearly $3 million increase in customer growth. From [indiscernible] on June 30, 2019, we added a net 35,000 customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. We are on track to exceed 1% net customer growth for the third consecutive year. These increases were offset by a $4 million decrease in customer consumption, primarily due to [indiscernible] in the third quarter compared to prior year. 
As a reminder, most of our weather normalization mechanism and enable, so our contribution margin was not covered for most of the quarter. 
Operating expenses rose to approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending  and planed 10% increase in O&M expense. 
As we discussed last quarter, we increased service headcount in our Mid-Tex Division to support the growth in our DFW market. 
Additionally, we experienced a 75 quarter-over-quarter increase in line locates, as many of our communities, in which we operate, continue to experience strong growth. 
We continue to rollout new lease survey technology into our operations. This technology is 1,000 times more [ expensive ] than traditional survey technology. Therefore, we are finding more potential indication meet our contract people to evaluate and assess these indications. While the increased on expenses near term, plays an important role in our ability to identify litigate risk. For example, during the quarter, we over used this technology in several of our jurisdictions, that were hit by storms to assess [indiscernible] damage. 
The performance in our Pipeline and Storage segment substantially offset the operating income decrease in our distribution segment. Operating income increased $12 million, driven by strong growth in contribution margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Contribution market increased $22 million as a result of APT's GRIP filing in 2018 and 2019, combining with the $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter rise in APT's through-system revenue as a result of ongoing supply-and-demand dynamics that in the Permian basin. The activity we experienced in the quarter was higher than anticipated due to 2 unexpected [ force-mature ] events and other pipelines, which drove higher than expected volumes into our systems. However, as new purchase -- as a new pipeline comes online, starting this summer, we expect the Waha to case spread to narrow. 
Offsetting the growth contribution margin was a $10 million increase in operating expenses as a result of higher depreciation rates to increase capital expenditures in a plant [indiscernible] pipeline integrity work. 
Unit day consolidated work capital spending was 10%, or increased 10% to $1.2 billion, which is in line with our plan. We continue to focus our spending and improving the safety and lability for spending of our system -- or [indiscernible] there's system system spending spending [ with ] 87%, focused on safety and reliability. 
Based on work completed year-to-date and planned spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2019 capital spending to be between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. 
From a regulatory perspective, to date, we have completed 21 filings. We should add approximately $110 million of annualized operating income over fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. And we have 6 filing pending about -- seeking about [ $87 ] million on an annualized operating income. We are in track to complete several of these filings during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Assuming this proceedings are resolved in line with our expectations, we remain on track to meet our target of completing $160 million to $180 million in annualized operating outcomes. 
Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and supports our capital spending program. As of June 30, [indiscernible]every total capitalization was 60% and made approximately $2 billion of putting under credit facilities into equity-forward agreements. 
Slide 9 summarizes our fiscal 2019 financing activities. Year-to-date, we have completed $2.1 billion of financing, including the issuance of $1.1 billion in long-term debt and $1 billion of equity. 
During the quarter, we continue to utilize forward agreements under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 needs. We issued 1.1 billion shares at an average price of [ $101.41 ]. 
Additionally, we settled the forward agreements for 1.1 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $100 million. 
As of June 30, we had about $410 million remaining under our forward agreements. Details for equity forward activities can also be found on Slide 9. 
As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we are well-positioned to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. However, given the higher-than-expected Permian basin activity we saw during third quarter, we now expect to be at the higher end of this range. 
Slides 12 and 13 provide selected information underlying our fiscal 2019 guidance. And we are well-positioned to meet our 5-year annual EPS growth target of 6% to 8% [ through ] fiscal 2023. We'll be rolling forward our 5-year plan through fiscal 2024 on our fiscal year-end earnings call in November.

I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to continuing the execution of the successful strategy that came in Mike and put in place as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the nation's safest provider of natural gas services. A key to achieving that division is to continue the evolution and refinement of our strategy by making investors in safety and reliability, while modernizing our business to sustain our company for the long term. 
This straight-forward focus improvement strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. 
As we've discussed before, increasing our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023 requires that we also invested in our people and technology. I'm proud to report that during the third quarter, we crossed over the 1 million hour mark for total accumulative hours of training, provided our state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan Center, which opened in 2010. This training is essential for our employees to become highly qualified gas professions. They continue to allow our [indiscernible] map digital asset data collection solution. Through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, with that approximately 35% of our company and contractor instruction crew trained in using this important technology. And we continue to systematically rollout our advanced mobile leak detection technology to enhance that'll enhance our ability to safety operator system, as Chris mentioned earlier. 
Implementing a safety management system is another strategic focus. While we have had components of the safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for many years, the safety management systems formalizes what we are doing and is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. This completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and plan to have our high-level roadmap developed for addressing gas later this fall. These are just a few of the examples of our investments in training and technology position us for sustained success in the future. 
In closing, i would like to thank our 4,700 employees, their dedication to safely operating our system, while providing excellent customer service and getting back to the communities where the work and live. That is the biggest reasons Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term.

So we're meeting to utilize this, so we intended all along to draw down on those proceeds as capital needs arise or cash needs arise in that period. So all that again is baked into our fiscal '19 guidance, it's baked into our 5-year plan, the $5.40 to $5.80. And as we look forward, we've stated, in the current 5-year plan, we have published a $5 billion to $6 billion incremental financing need that printed financing the balance fashion, using both long-term debt and equity.

But overtime, we expect as we gain proficiency that, that should come back into the line with the 2.5% to 3.5% guidelines that we established for the 5-year plan last fall. 
Additionally, we talked about low-pressure assessment. And when you get an opportunity with those increases in margins, we're always looking to take risk out of the from an O&M expected. So we've been yet increasing our, I guess, risk-based O&M works, that's in-line inspection, that's railway maintenance, that's low-pressure system assessment. Anything we can do to reduce risk in the current period that they will benefit for future periods. So that's the type of work that you're seeing in the O&M line item.

In Investor Relations, nothing says happy birthday more than hosting an earnings call. So congratulations. 
Yesterday, we reported our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, and I'm pleased to report that we're on track to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 and increase earnings per share for the 17th consecutive year. Capital spending increased 10% during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. Approximately, 87% of this spending is focused on safety and reliability investments as we continue to execute our risk-based capital spending program to modernize our distribution and transmission systems. 
Through June 30, 2019, we completed to $2.1 billion of financing, which has supported our fiscal 2019 capital spending, further strengthened our balance sheet, lowered the cost of financing for our customers and leaves us very well-positioned to maintain our credit ratings for the long term. 
We continue to invest in technology, our people and processes to achieve operating excellence and scale our capabilities to sustain our safety-driven strategies. With the team we have in place, we're extremely well positioned for continued success into the future. 
Yesterday, we announced that I'll step down from my role as President and Chief Executive Officer effective September 30 to focus on my health. I'll remain with the company to the end of the calendar year to support the transition, and I'll retire from the company and plan to step down from the Board effective January 1 of 2020. Also announced yesterday is that Kevin Akers, currently Executive Vice President, has been appointed by the Board to succeed me as President and CEO and become a member of the Board effective October 1 of this year. Kim Cocklin will continue as Executive Chairman. This is a very difficult decision for me, but it's the right decision for the company, for me and for my family. I've been facing a recent health issue that to this point has alluded a definitive diagnosis. I'm extremely optimistic this will resolve itself favorably in the long run, however, it's requiring an increasing amount of my time and it necessitates me pulling back on my commitments. 
This decision was made much, much easier for me by the fact that Kevin Akers is ready to assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin is a proven leader with broad company and industry experience, a majority of the nearly 29 years with the company has been in senior leadership position. He has deep operating experience, having previously served for over 9 years as President of our Kentucky/Mid-States Division, 5 years as President of our Mississippi Division, and more recently, took on responsibility for the company's pipeline and storage operations. 
For the past several years, Kevin also oversaw our pipeline safety, supply chain and customer service functions. And he's been instrumental in driving the process improvement and technology initiatives that have enabled the company to scale its operations to sustain our success. Many of you already know Kevin from our Analyst Day the past 2 years as well as the AGA Financial Forum and other investor conferences this year. Kevin is surrounded by a very seasoned senior leadership team. Chris and the rest of our management committee will continue in their current roles. They worked closely together for many, many years and even prior to being on the management committee. Not only are they respected colleagues, but they're also friends. And Kevin has the full support over 4,700 employees. 
One of our Board's most important responsibilities is succession planning, and they've done that masterfully over our 36 years as an independent public company. This succession plan has been in place for several years. And just as with prior transitions from our founder, Charles Vaughan, to Bob Best, to Kim Cocklin, to me, the transition to Kevin will be completely seamless. As I mentioned earlier, Kim will continue in the role of Executive Chairman. I'll be forever grateful to him as a great leader, as a mentor and a friend. His continued involvement in the company as Chairman as well as adviser to Kevin and the rest of the management committee will provide further assurance of the company's continued success. 
And lastly, before I turn the call over to Chris for the financial update, I'd like to thank the investors and analysts I've had the distinct pleasure to get to know over the past 4 years. Your support and investment in time and capital has been so critical for the success of our safety investment strategy. Your insights and challenging questions, it made us a better company and it made me a better leader.
I'd also like to thank our 4,700 employees for their continued outstanding efforts to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service to the 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every single day focused on safety while providing excellent customer service and executing our capital spending program focused on modernizing our system. It's been my greatest honor to serve alongside for them for the past 11 years. They are the reason that Atmos Energy will continue to be successful for the long term. 
Chris, over to you."
252684,628633435,1797370,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2019",2019-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was",1054,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was $453 million or $3.88 per diluted share compared with $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date result included $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share nonrecurring income tax benefit from tax reform. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted net income was $398 million or $3.60 per diluted share. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. It made the drivers' underlying outperformance during the first half of the year continuing into the third quarter. 
Slides 5 and 6 provide details for our quarter and year-to-date results. I will touch a few of the highlights. In our distribution segment, operating income increased $14.4 million to $48.7 million in the third quarter as the modest increase in contribution margin was offset by our higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased to $1 million quarter-over-quarter. We experienced a $7 million increase from new rates and a nearly $3 million increase from customer growth. In the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, we added a net 35,000 customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. We are on track to exceed 1% net customer growth for the third consecutive year. 
These increases were offset by a $4 million decrease in customer consumption primarily due to warmer weather in the third quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, most of our weather normalization mechanisms end in April, so our contribution margin was not covered for most of the quarter. 
Operating expenses rose approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and planned 10% increase in O&M expense. As we discussed last quarter, we increased service-led headcount in our Mid-Tex Division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we experienced a 7% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locates as many of our communities in which we operate continue to experience strong growth. 
We continue to roll out new leak survey technology into our operations. This technology is 1,000 times more expensive than traditional leak survey technology. Therefore, we are finding more potential leak indications. We strive to meet, to hire and attract the people to evaluate and assess these indications. While the deployment of this technology will increase O&M expense in the near term, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. For example, during the quarter, we already used this technology in several of our jurisdictions that were hit by heavy storms to assess if there's been super damage. 
The performance in our pipeline and storage segment substantially offset the operating income decrease in our distribution segment. Operating income increased $12 million, driven by strong growth in contribution margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased $22 million as a result of APT's GRIP filings in 2018 and 2019, combined with the $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter rise in APT's through-system revenue as a result of the ongoing supply-and-demand dynamics set in the Permian Basin. 
The activity we experienced in the quarter was higher than anticipated due to 2 unexpected force majeure events on other pipelines, which drove higher-than-expected volumes into our system. However, as a new purchased pipeline comes online starting late this summer, we expect the Waha and Katy spread to narrow. Offsetting the growth in contribution margin was a $10 million increase in operating expenses as a result of higher depreciation related to increased capital expenditures in a planned recent pipeline integrity work. 
Year-to-date consolidated capital spending was 10% -- or increased 10% to $1.2 billion, which is in line with our plan. We continue to focus our spending and improving the safety and reliability of our spending -- of our system -- or reliability of our systems with 87% focused on safety and reliability. Based on work completed year-to-date and planned spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2019 capital spending to be between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. 
From a regulatory perspective, to date, we have completed 21 filings. We should add approximately $110 million of annualized operating income over fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. And we have 6 filings pending about -- seeking about $87 million in an annualized operating income. We are on track to complete several of these filings during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Assuming these proceedings are resolved in line with our expectations, we remain on track to meet our target of completing $160 million to $180 million in annualized operating outcomes. 
Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and supports our capital spending program. As of June 30, equity to total capitalization was 60%, and we had approximately $2 billion we're putting under our credit facilities into equity forward agreements.
Slide 9 summarizes our fiscal 2019 financing activities. Year-to-date, we have completed $2.1 billion of financing, including the issuance of $1.1 billion in long-term debt and $1 billion of equity. During the quarter, we continue to utilize forward agreements under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 needs. We issued 1.1 million shares at an average price of $101.11. Additionally, we settled the forward agreements with 1.1 million shares with net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of June 30, we had about $410 million remaining under our forward agreements. Details of our equity forward activities could also be found on Slide 9. 
As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we are well-positioned to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. However, given the higher-than-expected Permian Basin activity we saw during third quarter, we now expect to be at the higher end of this range. Slides 12 and 13 provide selected information underlying our fiscal 2019 guidance. And we are well-positioned to meet our 5-year annual EPS growth target of 6% to 8% through fiscal 2023. We'll be rolling forward our 5-year plan through fiscal 2024 on our fiscal year-end earnings call in November. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for some closing remarks."

Mike, thank you for those kind remarks. We are deeply indebted to you for your leadership, your vision and unwavering dedication and support for Atmos Energy and every one of our 4,700 employees. I'm very exci",444,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Mike, thank you for those kind remarks. We are deeply indebted to you for your leadership, your vision and unwavering dedication and support for Atmos Energy and every one of our 4,700 employees. I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to continuing the execution of the successful strategy that Kim and Mike have put in place as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the nation's safest provider of natural gas services. 
A key to achieving that vision is to continue the evolution and refinement of our strategy by making investments in safety and reliability while modernizing our business to sustain our company for the long term. This straight-forward focused improvement strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. 
As we've discussed before, increasing our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023 requires that we also invest in our people and technology. I'm proud to report that during the third quarter, we crossed over the 1 million hour mark for total cumulative hours of training provided our state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan Center, which opened in 2010. This training is essential for our employees to become highly qualified gas professionals. 
We continue to roll out our Locus Map digital asset data collection solution through the first 9 months of this fiscal year. We've had approximately 35% of our company and contract construction crews trained on using this important technology. And we continue to systematically roll out our advanced mobile leak detection technology that will enhance our ability to take the operator system, as Chris mentioned earlier. 
Implementing a safety management system is another strategic focus. While we have had components of a safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for many years, the safety management systems formalizes what we are doing and is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. We've completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and plan to have our high-level road map developed for addressing gas later this fall. These are just a few of the examples of how our investments in training and technology position us for sustained success in the future. 
In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees, their dedication to safely operating our system while providing excellent customer service and giving back to the communities where they work and live. That is the biggest reasons Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term. 
We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll take any questions you may have."

As we've talked about with you and others on the call, we have a long backlog of work to do, if you will, and just a lot of work to get down in terms of pipe replacement. So we will be just rolling it forward another year. You'll expect to see just an increase in line with the increase in the capital spending that you've seen from us over the last several years. Financing strategies can be pretty consistent with what you've seen as well. We'll update and freshen those numbers on that call. But I think the key takeaway today is that the strategy is the same and will just be a roll-forward of what we've demonstrated through 2023 at this point."

In our last quarter call, we said we had no discrete equity issuances planned through the end of fiscal 2020. We did have the proceeds, but that was just on the forward arrangements, which, as you know, expire. Some of the -- most of the proceeds right now expire at the end of March. That's about a little over $100 million expiring at the end of September. So we're needing to utilize these proceeds, so we'd intended all along to draw it down on those proceeds as capital needs arise or our cash needs arise in that period. So all of that again is baked into our fiscal '19 guidance. It's baked into our 5-year plan, the $5.40 to $5.80. And as we look forward, we stated -- in the current 5-year plan, we have published a $5 billion to $6 billion incremental financing need. And we intend to finance that in a balanced fashion, using both long-term debt and equity. So again, we'll -- that strategy is going to look very similar when we roll that forward in November. But again, the financing that we did in the third quarter is not to satisfy FY '19 equity needs. It will satisfy our FY 2020 needs and beyond."

A lot of work is going in. But over time, we expect that as we gain proficiency, that, that should come back in the line with the 2.5% to 3.5% guideline that we established for the 5-year plan last fall. 
Additionally, we talked about low-pressure assessments and when you get an opportunity with increases in margins, we're always looking to take risk off the table from an O&M perspective. So we've been increasing our, I guess, risk-based O&M works. That's in-line inspection. That's right-away maintenance. That's low-pressure system assessments, anything we can do to reduce risk in the current period that will benefit for future periods.

And even prior to that, the way we operate, I've worked very closely with Kevin, and our entire leadership team works very closely together. Over the last 2.5 years, our management committee meets for half a day and then informally, several days a week. So we're completely in lockstep. And Kevin and I work side-by-side in all of the initiatives that he's been driving for scale and scope. So in a nutshell, the transition is going to be extremely smooth and uneventful internally since we've been working so closely together all along, as was mentioned. And he and I are working more closely now. 
But as I mentioned earlier, he'll assume the President and CEO position on October 1. I will be still around and available to him and meet with him on a regular basis through the end of the calendar year. And also as I mentioned, Kim will continue as Executive Chairman, and he's always been tremendously helpful to all of us as an adviser. 
So I know it's not similar to many other companies. But at Atmos, everybody's in the same -- we're in the same bullpen and dugout every single day of the week. So it's a -- and the strategy, as Chris said, is not going to change. It's a matter of scaling, sustaining our success and just executing well, taking care of our employees in the process, making sure they've development opportunities, the training they need, we remain in compliance. And all of the things that we've talked about regularly, Kevin had a responsibility for it for the last couple of years, obviously executed by our division leadership and shared services leadership, but he's got a firm hand on the tiller right now.

And happy birthday, Jennifer. In Investor Relations, nothing says happy birthday more than hosting an earnings call. So congratulations. Yesterday, we reported our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, and I",892,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. And happy birthday, Jennifer. In Investor Relations, nothing says happy birthday more than hosting an earnings call. So congratulations. 
Yesterday, we reported our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, and I'm pleased to report that we're on track to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 and increase earnings per share for the 17th consecutive year. Capital spending increased 10% during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. Approximately, 87% of this spending is focused on safety and reliability investments as we continue to execute our risk-based capital spending program to modernize our distribution and transmission systems. 
Through June 30, 2019, we completed to $2.1 billion of financing, which has supported our fiscal 2019 capital spending, further strengthened our balance sheet, lowered the cost of financing for our customers and leaves us very well-positioned to maintain our credit ratings for the long term. 
We continue to invest in technology, our people and processes to achieve operating excellence and scale our capabilities to sustain our safety-driven strategies. With the team we have in place, we're extremely well-positioned for continued success into the future. 
Yesterday, we announced that I'll step down from my role as President and Chief Executive Officer effective September 30 to focus on my health. I'll remain with the company to the end of the calendar year to support the transition, and I'll retire from the company and plan to step down from the Board effective January 1 of 2020. Also announced yesterday is that Kevin Akers, currently Executive Vice President, has been appointed by the Board to succeed me as President and CEO and become a member of the Board effective October 1 of this year. Kim Cocklin will continue as Executive Chairman. This was a very difficult decision for me, but it's the right decision for the company, for me and for my family. I've been facing a recent health issue that to this point has alluded a definitive diagnosis. I'm extremely optimistic this will resolve itself favorably in the long run, however, it's requiring an increasing amount of my time and it necessitates me pulling back on my commitments. 
This decision was made much, much easier for me by the fact that Kevin Akers is ready to assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin is a proven leader with broad company and industry experience, the majority of the nearly 29 years with the company has been in senior leadership position. He has deep operating experience, having previously served for over 9 years as President of our Kentucky/Mid-States Division, 5 years as President of our Mississippi Division, and more recently, took on responsibility for the company's pipeline and storage operations. 
For the past several years, Kevin also oversaw our pipeline safety, supply chain and customer service functions. And he's been instrumental in driving the process improvement and technology initiatives that have enabled the company to scale its operations to sustain our success. Many of you already know Kevin from our Analyst Day the past 2 years as well as the AGA Financial Forum and other investor conferences this year. Kevin is surrounded by a very seasoned senior leadership team. Chris and the rest of our management committee will continue in their current roles. They worked closely together for many, many years and even prior to being on the management committee. Not only are they respected colleagues, but they're also friends. And Kevin has the full support of our 4,700 employees. 
One of our Board's most important responsibilities is succession planning, and they've done that masterfully over our 36 years as an independent public company. This succession plan has been in place for several years. And just as with prior transitions from our founder, Charles Vaughan, to Bob Best, to Kim Cocklin, to me, the transition to Kevin will be completely seamless. As I mentioned earlier, Kim will continue in the role of Executive Chairman. I'll be forever grateful to him as a great leader, as a mentor and a friend. His continued involvement in the company as Chairman as well as adviser to Kevin and the rest of the management committee will provide further assurance of the company's continued success. 
And lastly, before I turn the call over to Chris for the financial update, I'd like to thank the investors and analysts I've had the distinct pleasure to get to know over the past 4 years. Your support in investment and time and capital has been so critical for the success of our safety investment strategy. Your insights and challenging questions, it made us a better company and it made me a better leader.
I'd also like to thank our 4,700 employees for their continued outstanding efforts to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service to the 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every single day focused on safety while providing excellent customer service and executing our capital spending program focused on modernizing our system. It's been my greatest honor to serve alongside them for the past 11 years. They are the reason that Atmos Energy will continue to be successful for the long term. 
Chris, over to you."

Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was",1055,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was $453 million or $3.88 per diluted share compared with $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date result included $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share nonrecurring income tax benefit from tax reform. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted net income was $398 million or $3.60 per diluted share. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. It made the drivers' underlying outperformance during the first half of the year continuing into the third quarter. 
Slides 5 and 6 provide details for our quarter and year-to-date results. I will touch a few of the highlights. In our distribution segment, operating income increased $14.4 million to $48.7 million in the third quarter as the modest increase in contribution margin was offset by our higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased to $1 million quarter-over-quarter. We experienced a $7 million increase from new rates and a nearly $3 million increase from customer growth. In the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, we added a net 35,000 customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. We are on track to exceed 1% net customer growth for the third consecutive year. 
These increases were offset by a $4 million decrease in customer consumption primarily due to warmer weather in the third quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, most of our weather normalization mechanisms end in April, so our contribution margin was not covered for most of the quarter. 
Operating expenses rose approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and planned 10% increase in O&M expense. As we discussed last quarter, we increased service-led headcount in our Mid-Tex Division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we experienced a 7% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locates as many of our communities in which we operate continue to experience strong growth. 
We continue to roll out new leak survey technology into our operations. This technology is 1,000 times more expensive than traditional leak survey technology. Therefore, we are finding more potential leak indications. We strive to meet, to hire and attract the people to evaluate and assess these indications. While the deployment of this technology will increase O&M expense in the near term, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. For example, during the quarter, we already used this technology in several of our jurisdictions that were hit by heavy storms to assess if there's been super damage. 
The performance in our pipeline and storage segment substantially offset the operating income decrease in our distribution segment. Operating income increased $12 million, driven by strong growth in contribution margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased $22 million as a result of APT's GRIP filings in 2018 and 2019, combined with the $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter rise in APT's through-system revenue as a result of the ongoing supply-and-demand dynamics set in the Permian Basin. 
The activity we experienced in the quarter was higher than anticipated due to 2 unexpected force majeure events on other pipelines, which drove higher-than-expected volumes into our system. However, as a new purchased pipeline comes online starting late this summer, we expect the Waha and Katy spread to narrow. Offsetting the growth in contribution margin was a $10 million increase in operating expenses as a result of higher depreciation related to increased capital expenditures in a planned recent pipeline integrity work. 
Year-to-date consolidated capital spending was 10% -- or increased 10% to $1.2 billion, which is in line with our plan. We continue to focus our spending and improving the safety and reliability of our spending -- of our system -- or reliability of our systems spending with 87% focused on safety and reliability. Based on work completed year-to-date and planned spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2019 capital spending to be between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. 
From a regulatory perspective, to date, we have completed 21 filings. We should add approximately $110 million of annualized operating income over fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. And we have 6 filings pending about -- seeking about $87 million in an annualized operating income. We are on track to complete several of these filings during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Assuming these proceedings are resolved in line with our expectations, we remain on track to meet our target of completing $160 million to $180 million in annualized operating outcomes. 
Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and supports our capital spending program. As of June 30, equity to total capitalization was 60%, and we had approximately $2 billion we're putting under our credit facilities into equity forward agreements.
Slide 9 summarizes our fiscal 2019 financing activities. Year-to-date, we have completed $2.1 billion of financing, including the issuance of $1.1 billion in long-term debt and $1 billion of equity. During the quarter, we continue to utilize forward agreements under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 needs. We issued 1.1 million shares at an average price of $101.11. Additionally, we settled the forward agreements with 1.1 million shares with net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of June 30, we had about $410 million remaining under our forward agreements. Details of our equity forward activities could also be found on Slide 9. 
As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we are well-positioned to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. However, given the higher-than-expected Permian Basin activity we saw during third quarter, we now expect to be at the higher end of this range. Slides 12 and 13 provide selected information underlying our fiscal 2019 guidance. And we are well-positioned to meet our 5-year annual EPS growth target of 6% to 8% through fiscal 2023. We'll be rolling forward our 5-year plan through fiscal 2024 on our fiscal year-end earnings call in November. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for some closing remarks."

We are deeply indebted to you for your leadership, your vision and unwavering dedication and support for Atmos Energy and every one of our 4,700 employees. I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to continuing the execution of the successful strategy that Kim and Mike have put in place as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the nation's safest provider of natural gas services. 
A key to achieving that vision is to continue the evolution and refinement of our strategy by making investments in safety and reliability while modernizing our business to sustain our company for the long term. This straight-forward focused improvement strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. 
As we've discussed before, increasing our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023 requires that we also invest in our people and technology. I'm proud to report that during the third quarter, we crossed over the 1 million hour mark for total cumulative hours of training provided our state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan Center, which opened in 2010. This training is essential for our employees to become highly qualified gas professionals. 
We continue to roll out our Locus Map digital asset data collection solution through the first 9 months of this fiscal year. We've had approximately 35% of our company and contract construction crews trained on using this important technology. And we continue to systematically roll out our advanced mobile leak detection technology that will enhance our ability to take the operator system, as Chris mentioned earlier. 
Implementing a safety management system is another strategic focus. While we have had components of a safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for many years, the safety management systems formalizes what we are doing and is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. We've completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and plan to have our high-level road map developed for addressing gas later this fall. These are just a few of the examples of how our investments in training and technology position us for sustained success in the future. 
In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees, their dedication to safely operating our system while providing excellent customer service and giving back to the communities where they work and live. That is the biggest reasons Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term. 
We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll take any questions you may have."

In our last quarter call, we said we had no discrete equity issuances planned through the end of fiscal 2020. We did have the proceeds available to us just on the forward arrangements, which, as you know, expire. Some of the -- most of the proceeds right now expire at the end of March. That's about a little over $100 million expiring at the end of September. So we're needing to utilize these proceeds, so we'd intended all along to draw it down on those proceeds as capital needs arise or our cash needs arise in that period. So all of that again is baked into our fiscal '19 guidance. It's baked into our 5-year plan, the $5.40 to $5.80. And as we look forward, we stated -- in the current 5-year plan, we have published a $5 billion to $6 billion incremental financing need. And we intend to finance that in a balanced fashion, using both long-term debt and equity. So again, we'll -- that strategy is going to look very similar when we roll that forward in November. But again, the financing that we did in the third quarter is not to satisfy FY '19 equity needs. It will satisfy our FY 2020 needs and beyond."

Additionally, we talked about low-pressure assessments and when you get an opportunity with increases in margins, we're always looking to take risk off the table from an O&M perspective. So we've been increasing our, I guess, risk-based O&M works. That's in-line inspection. That's right-away maintenance. That's low-pressure system assessments, anything we can do to reduce risk in the current period that will benefit for future periods. So that's the type of work that you're seeing in the O&M line item, and we'll just continue to manage that going forward as needs arise and as opportunities arise as well."

And this is a -- as I mentioned in my comments, this succession plan has been in place for quite a while. And even prior to that, the way we operate, I've worked very closely with Kevin, and our entire leadership team works very closely together. Over the last 2.5 years, our management committee meets for half a day and then informally, several days a week. So we're completely in lockstep. And Kevin and I work side-by-side in all of the initiatives that he's been driving for scale and scope. So in a nutshell, the transition is going to be extremely smooth and uneventful internally since we've been working so closely together all along, as was mentioned. And he and I are working more closely now. 
But as I mentioned earlier, he'll assume the President and CEO position on October 1. I will be still around and available to him and meet with him on a regular basis through the end of the calendar year. And also as I mentioned, Kim will continue as Executive Chairman, and he's always been tremendously helpful to all of us as an adviser. 
So I know it's not similar to many other companies. But at Atmos, everybody's in the same -- we're in the same bullpen and dugout every single day of the week. So it's a -- and the strategy, as Chris said, is not going to change. It's a matter of scaling, sustaining our success and just executing well, taking care of our employees in the process, making sure they've development opportunities, the training they need, we remain in compliance. And all of the things that we've talked about regularly, Kevin's had the responsibility for it for the last couple of years, obviously executed by our division leadership and shared services leadership, but he's got a firm hand on the tiller right now.

In Investor Relations, nothing says happy birthday more than hosting an earnings call. So congratulations. 
Yesterday, we reported our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, and I'm pleased to report that we're on track to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 and increase earnings per share for the 17th consecutive year. Capital spending increased 10% during the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. Approximately, 87% of this spending is focused on safety and reliability investments as we continue to execute our risk-based capital spending program to modernize our distribution and transmission systems. 
Through June 30, 2019, we completed to $2.1 billion of financing, which has supported our fiscal 2019 capital spending, further strengthened our balance sheet, lowered the cost of financing for our customers and leaves us very well-positioned to maintain our credit ratings for the long term. 
We continue to invest in technology, our people and processes to achieve operating excellence and scale our capabilities to sustain our safety-driven strategies. With the team we have in place, we're extremely well-positioned for continued success into the future. 
Yesterday, we announced that I'll step down from my role as President and Chief Executive Officer effective September 30 to focus on my health. I'll remain with the company to the end of the calendar year to support the transition, and I'll retire from the company and plan to step down from the Board effective January 1 of 2020. Also announced yesterday is that Kevin Akers, currently Executive Vice President, has been appointed by the Board to succeed me as President and CEO and become a member of the Board effective October 1 of this year. Kim Cocklin will continue as Executive Chairman. This was a very difficult decision for me, but it's the right decision for the company, for me and for my family. I've been facing a recent health issue that to this point has alluded a definitive diagnosis. I'm extremely optimistic this will resolve itself favorably in the long run, however, it's requiring an increasing amount of my time and it necessitates me pulling back on my commitments. 
This decision was made much, much easier for me by the fact that Kevin Akers is ready to assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin is a proven leader with broad company and industry experience, the majority of the nearly 29 years with the company has been in senior leadership position. He has deep operating experience, having previously served for over 9 years as President of our Kentucky/Mid-States Division, 5 years as President of our Mississippi Division, and more recently, took on responsibility for the company's pipeline and storage operations. 
For the past several years, Kevin also oversaw our pipeline safety, supply chain and customer service functions. And he's been instrumental in driving the process improvement and technology initiatives that have enabled the company to scale its operations to sustain our success. Many of you already know Kevin from our Analyst Day the past 2 years as well as the AGA Financial Forum and other investor conferences this year. Kevin is surrounded by a very seasoned senior leadership team. Chris and the rest of our management committee will continue in their current roles. They worked closely together for many, many years and even prior to being on the management committee. Not only are they respected colleagues, but they're also friends. And Kevin has the full support of our 4,700 employees. 
One of our Board's most important responsibilities is succession planning, and they've done that masterfully over our 36 years as an independent public company. This succession plan has been in place for several years. And just as with prior transitions from our founder, Charles Vaughan, to Bob Best, to Kim Cocklin, to me, the transition to Kevin will be completely seamless. As I mentioned earlier, Kim will continue in the role of Executive Chairman. I'll be forever grateful to him as a great leader, as a mentor and a friend. His continued involvement in the company as Chairman as well as adviser to Kevin and the rest of the management committee will provide further assurance of the company's continued success. 
And lastly, before I turn the call over to Chris for the financial update, I'd like to thank the investors and analysts I've had the distinct pleasure to get to know over the past 4 years. Your support in investment and time and capital has been so critical for the success of our safety investment strategy. Your insights and challenging questions, it made us a better company and it made me a better leader.
I'd also like to thank our 4,700 employees for their continued outstanding efforts to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service to the 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every single day focused on safety while providing excellent customer service and executing our capital spending program focused on modernizing our system. It's been my greatest honor to serve alongside them for the past 11 years. They are the reason that Atmos Energy will continue to be successful for the long term. 
Chris, over to you."
252684,628633435,1804951,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2019",2019-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was",1055,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was $453 million or $3.88 per diluted share compared with $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date result included $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share nonrecurring income tax benefit from tax reform. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted net income was $398 million or $3.60 per diluted share. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations. It made the drivers' underlying outperformance during the first half of the year continuing into the third quarter. 
Slides 5 and 6 provide details for our quarter and year-to-date results. I will touch a few of the highlights. In our distribution segment, operating income increased $14.4 million to $48.7 million in the third quarter as the modest increase in contribution margin was offset by our higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased to $1 million quarter-over-quarter. We experienced a $7 million increase from new rates and a nearly $3 million increase from customer growth. In the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, we added a net 35,000 customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. We are on track to exceed 1% net customer growth for the third consecutive year. 
These increases were offset by a $4 million decrease in customer consumption primarily due to warmer weather in the third quarter compared to prior year. As a reminder, most of our weather normalization mechanisms end in April, so our contribution margin was not covered for most of the quarter. 
Operating expenses rose approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and planned 10% increase in O&M expense. As we discussed last quarter, we increased service-led headcount in our Mid-Tex Division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we experienced a 7% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locates as many of our communities in which we operate continue to experience strong growth. 
We continue to roll out new leak survey technology into our operations. This technology is 1,000 times more expensive than traditional leak survey technology. Therefore, we are finding more potential leak indications. We strive to meet, to hire and attract the people to evaluate and assess these indications. While the deployment of this technology will increase O&M expense in the near term, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. For example, during the quarter, we already used this technology in several of our jurisdictions that were hit by heavy storms to assess if there's been super damage. 
The performance in our pipeline and storage segment substantially offset the operating income decrease in our distribution segment. Operating income increased $12 million, driven by strong growth in contribution margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased $22 million as a result of APT's GRIP filings in 2018 and 2019, combined with the $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter rise in APT's through-system revenue as a result of the ongoing supply-and-demand dynamics set in the Permian Basin. 
The activity we experienced in the quarter was higher than anticipated due to 2 unexpected force majeure events on other pipelines, which drove higher-than-expected volumes into our system. However, as a new purchased pipeline comes online starting late this summer, we expect the Waha and Katy spread to narrow. Offsetting the growth in contribution margin was a $10 million increase in operating expenses as a result of higher depreciation related to increased capital expenditures in a planned recent pipeline integrity work. 
Year-to-date consolidated capital spending was 10% -- or increased 10% to $1.2 billion, which is in line with our plan. We continue to focus our spending and improving the safety and reliability of our spending -- of our system -- or reliability of our systems spending with 87% focused on safety and reliability. Based on work completed year-to-date and planned spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2019 capital spending to be between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. 
From a regulatory perspective, to date, we have completed 21 filings. We should add approximately $110 million of annualized operating income over fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. And we have 6 filings pending about -- seeking about $87 million in an annualized operating income. We are on track to complete several of these filings during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Assuming these proceedings are resolved in line with our expectations, we remain on track to meet our target of completing $160 million to $180 million in annualized operating outcomes. 
Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and supports our capital spending program. As of June 30, equity to total capitalization was 60%, and we had approximately $2 billion we're putting under our credit facilities into equity forward agreements.
Slide 9 summarizes our fiscal 2019 financing activities. Year-to-date, we have completed $2.1 billion of financing, including the issuance of $1.1 billion in long-term debt and $1 billion of equity. During the quarter, we continue to utilize forward agreements under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 needs. We issued 1.1 million shares at an average price of $101.11. Additionally, we settled the forward agreements with 1.1 million shares with net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of June 30, we had about $410 million remaining under our forward agreements. Details of our equity forward activities could also be found on Slide 9. 
As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we are well-positioned to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. However, given the higher-than-expected Permian Basin activity we saw during third quarter, we now expect to be at the higher end of this range. Slides 12 and 13 provide selected information underlying our fiscal 2019 guidance. And we are well-positioned to meet our 5-year annual EPS growth target of 6% to 8% through fiscal 2023. We'll be rolling forward our 5-year plan through fiscal 2024 on our fiscal year-end earnings call in November.

I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to continuing the execution of the successful strategy that Kim and Mike have put in place as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the nation's safest provider of natural gas services. 
A key to achieving that vision is to continue the evolution and refinement of our strategy by making investments in safety and reliability while modernizing our business to sustain our company for the long term. This straight-forward focused improvement strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. 
As we've discussed before, increasing our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023 requires that we also invest in our people and technology. I'm proud to report that during the third quarter, we crossed over the 1 million hour mark for total cumulative hours of training provided our state-of-the-art Charles K.

We've had approximately 35% of our company and contract construction crews trained on using this important technology. And we continue to systematically roll out our advanced mobile leak detection technology that will enhance our ability to take the operator system, as Chris mentioned earlier. 
Implementing a safety management system is another strategic focus. While we have had components of a safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for many years, the safety management systems formalizes what we are doing and is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. We've completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and plan to have our high-level road map developed for addressing gas later this fall. These are just a few of the examples of how our investments in training and technology position us for sustained success in the future. 
In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees, their dedication to safely operating our system while providing excellent customer service and giving back to the communities where they work and live. That is the biggest reasons Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term. 
We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll take any questions you may have."

We will cover off the remainder of fiscal '19 and then really focus on where we're going to be going into fiscal 2020. And really, the story and the strategy remains the same. As we've talked about with you and others on the call, we have a long backlog of work to do, if you will, and just a lot of work to get down in terms of pipe replacement. So we will be just rolling it forward another year. You'll expect to see just an increase in line with the increase in the capital spending that you've seen from us over the last several years. Financing strategies can be pretty consistent with what you've seen as well. We'll update and freshen those numbers on that call. But I think the key takeaway today is that the strategy is the same and will just be a roll-forward of what we've demonstrated through 2023 at this point."

In our last quarter call, we said we had no discrete equity issuances planned through the end of fiscal 2020. We did have the proceeds available to us just on the forward arrangements, which, as you know, expire. Some of the -- most of the proceeds right now expire at the end of March. That's about a little over $100 million expiring at the end of September. So we're needing to utilize these proceeds, so we'd intended all along to draw it down on those proceeds as capital needs arise or our cash needs arise in that period. So all of that again is baked into our fiscal '19 guidance. It's baked into our 5-year plan, the $5.40 to $5.80. And as we look forward, we stated -- in the current 5-year plan, we have published a $5 billion to $6 billion incremental financing need. And we intend to finance that in a balanced fashion, using both long-term debt and equity. So again, we'll -- that strategy is going to look very similar when we roll that forward in November. But again, the financing that we did in the third quarter is not to satisfy FY '19 equity needs. It will satisfy our FY 2020 needs and beyond."

So that was continuing to roll out the AMLD technology that Kevin commented on. We are -- because it's new to us the indications that came in just require a little bit more assessment. A lot of work is going in. But over time, we expect that as we gain proficiency that, that should come back in the line with the 2.5% to 3.5% guideline that we established for the 5-year plan last fall. 
Additionally, we talked about low-pressure assessments and when you get an opportunity with increases in margins, we're always looking to take risk off the table from an O&M perspective. So we've been increasing our, I guess, risk-based O&M works. That's in-line inspection. That's right-away maintenance. That's low-pressure system assessments, anything we can do to reduce risk in the current period that will benefit for future periods. So that's the type of work that you're seeing in the O&M line item, and we'll just continue to manage that going forward as needs arise and as opportunities arise as well."

And even prior to that, the way we operate, I've worked very closely with Kevin, and our entire leadership team works very closely together. Over the last 2.5 years, our management committee meets for half a day and then informally, several days a week. So we're completely in lockstep. And Kevin and I work side-by-side in all of the initiatives that he's been driving for scale and scope. So in a nutshell, the transition is going to be extremely smooth and uneventful internally since we've been working so closely together all along, as was mentioned. And he and I are working more closely now. 
But as I mentioned earlier, he'll assume the President and CEO position on October 1. I will be still around and available to him and meet with him on a regular basis through the end of the calendar year. And also as I mentioned, Kim will continue as Executive Chairman, and he's always been tremendously helpful to all of us as an adviser. 
So I know it's not similar to many other companies. But at Atmos, everybody's in the same -- we're in the same bullpen and dugout every single day of the week. So it's a -- and the strategy, as Chris said, is not going to change. It's a matter of scaling, sustaining our success and just executing well, taking care of our employees in the process, making sure they've development opportunities, the training they need, we remain in compliance. And all of the things that we've talked about regularly, Kevin's had the responsibility for it for the last couple of years, obviously executed by our division leadership and shared services leadership, but he's got a firm hand on the tiller right now.

We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of risin",1735,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. 
Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of rising earnings per share. 
Slides 6 and 7 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights. 
Consolidated contribution margin rose [ about ] 5% or about $95 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, provided an incremental $80 million. Virtually all of these increases were our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi jurisdictions. 
As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, our pipeline and storage segment benefited from the supply and demand dynamics that have impacted pricing in the Permian Basin over the last 12 to 18 months. We were able to capture a portion of the widened Waha [indiscernible] spread, resulting in a $12 million increase over fiscal 2018. However, as expected, a new merchant pipeline came online mid-summer, and we saw narrower spread opportunities in the back half of the fourth quarter. 
Finally, our distribution segment continued to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 37,000 customers, a 1.2% increase over last year. 
Consolidated operating expenses rose approximately 6%, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and higher O&M spending attributed to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance activities and higher employee costs. 
As we discussed last quarter, in fiscal 2019, we increased service-related headcount in our Mid-Tex division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we continue to roll out our rollout of advanced leak survey technology. Although this rollout has modestly increased our O&M, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. Finally, we continue to increase the training provided to our employees to further enable them to operate our systems safely and reliably. 
Consolidated capital spending increased 15% to $1.7 billion with 87% of our spending directed towards investments to improve the safety and reliability of our system. Our ability to support this level of capital spending is due in part to the various regulatory mechanisms we have in place to minimize regulatory lag. During fiscal 2019, over 85% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $117 million in annualized operating income increases through 23 regulatory proceedings. Since September 30, we have implemented an additional $57 million through 6 regulatory proceedings that were filed in the back half of fiscal 2019. As of today, we have 4 pumps pending seeking about $6 million. Slides 39 to 53 summarize our regulatory activities for fiscal 2019. 
Our ability to support this level of capital spending is also predicated on our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our ongoing capital expenditure program while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we continue to utilize equity forward agreements executed under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 equity needs. 
We issued 1.4 million shares at an average price of $108.70. additionally, we sold forward agreements for $1.1 million -- or 1.1 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of September 30, 2019, we had about $463 million remaining under equity forward arrangements. 
This issuance completed a very busy financing year where we were able to successfully raise over $2 billion of debt and equity financing. In the process, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 5.21% to 4.58%, and  increased our weighted average maturities from 16 years to 22 years, helping to ensure our customers benefit from the current low interest rate environment for years to come. And our equity capitalization increased 230 basis points to 59% as of September 30. 
We finished the fiscal year with approximately $1.6 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. Details of our financing activities, including our effort arrangements as well as our financial profile we found on slides 9 to 11. 
Looking forward, fiscal 2020 will represent the ninth year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution transition storage systems. Our plan is summarized on Slide 13. we expect fiscal 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share, with about 68% of our earnings coming from our distribution segment. By fiscal 2024, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.30 per diluted share. 
Slides 14 and 15 presents some of the details supporting our fiscal 2020 guidance. O&M is expected to be in line with fiscal 2019. Our O&M will continue to be focused on [indiscernible] activities that address system safety and compliance. These activities include enhanced leak survey, pipeline integrity work and continued record establishment and retention. It also includes spending for work to help us set a baseline of understanding of our system before [ PHMSA's ] new integrity management rules go into effect on July 1, 2020. As we've discussed in the past, we have been anticipating these rules for a few years and reflected that activity in our future O&M projections. As a result, some of the last year's 5-year plan, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 2.5% to 3.5% annually. 
Depreciation will rise due to high level of capital spending. Interest expense was lower as we reduced our weighted average cost of debt and expect to capitalize more interest through AFUDC. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in fiscal 2020, inclusive of the impact of amortizing our excess deferred tax liabilities. Excluding this amortization, we anticipate the effective tax rate to range from 23% to 25%. 
Fiscal 2020 capital spending is expected to rise about 12% and range between $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, with approximately 86% of the spending dedicated to safety and reliability spending. Approximately [ 73% ] of the spending will be allocated to our distribution segment. Almost 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to be earning a return within 6 months of the test period end. 
Continued spending per system replacement and modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal 2024. As you can see on Slide 17, we anticipate capital spending to increase 7% to 8% per year off the fiscal 2019 spend levels for a total of $10 billion to $11 billion over the next 5 years. This level of spending is expected to approximate 4x depreciation annually. This should result in rate base growth [ about ] 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $17 billion to $18 billion in fiscal 2024, up from about $9 billion at the end of fiscal 2019 as you can see on Slide 18. 
Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract new capital needed to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to our customer bill while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We've assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal 2024. 
In fiscal 2020, we anticipate completing filings for $160 million to $180 million of annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2020 and 2021. 
 moving to Slide 20. In LIBOR financial performance for fiscal 2019, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved our 144th consecutive point cash dividend yesterday. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2020 is $2.30, a 9.5% increase over fiscal 2019. 
We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next 5 years, and we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50%. And it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing a return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. This 5-year plan continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors while preserving our strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing for our customers. 
Based on our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a crude mix of long-term debt and equity financing in order to maintain a balanced capital structure. They targeted every capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized on Slide 21. And consistent with prior plans, our financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2024. 
In October, we got off to a great start towards executing this plan with the issuance of $800 million in long-term debt. We issued a mix of 10-year and third year notes to achieve a weighted average cost of debt of 3.18% in this offer. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt decreased another 26 basis points to 4.32%. 
From an equity perspective, we announced during fiscal 2019 that we did not perceive the need for a discrete equity issuance in fiscal 2020. The equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2019 are expected to satisfy a substantial portion of our equity needs for the fiscal year. We expect to remain -- raise the remaining equity needs for fiscal 2020 through our ATM program. 
In closing, the execution of our operating plans to modernize our systems with disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends per share 6% to 8% annual through fiscal 2024. And as you can see on slides 22 and 23, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which helps sustain this plan for the long term. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his prepared remarks."
252684,639832447,1856639,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 mi",1392,"Thank you, Chris. Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 miles of distribution pipeline and 5,700 miles of interstate pipeline provides safe and reliable service to our customers every day. 
In addition to achieving our financial targets for fiscal 2019, we continue to modernize our system. In fiscal year 2019, as you saw on Slide 27, our team replaced about 775 -- 770 miles of distribution pipe, 120 miles of transmission pipe and 53,000 service lines across the 8 states in which we operate. 
We continue to utilize technology to modernize our business. In fiscal 2019, we deployed new technology called Locus Map. That allows us to digitally capture our asset data as we complete our project. This technology is helping us to scale our operations and improve the quality and timeliness of our asset data collection requirements. At the end of fiscal 2019, this rollout was about [ 50% ] complete and on track to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2020. 
We  also continued our systematic rollout of advanced leak detection technology to enhance our ability to monitor our system, keep the public safe and to help us prioritize the pipe placement work. 
At our customer support centers, we completed the implementation of new technology that we refer to as skills-based routing. Skills-based routing matches a caller to the customer support associates best suited to handle their needs by using predictive analytics within our SAP system. Our electronic billing continues to be one of the highest in the industry at 43%. based on a 2019 American Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute benchmarking survey, our penetration for electronic billing was rated #1 for gas-only utility and #4 for all gas, electric and combination utility. We increased our electronic billing penetration by 2.4% in fiscal year 2019. 
Also in fiscal year 2019, our Spanish account center was released along with an upgrade to our integrated voice response system. 
These are just a few examples of the many initiatives we have in progress or completed as we modernize our system and our business. As you know, our vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services, and training is key to part of that vision. In 2019, we provided nearly 288,000 hours at our Charles K. Vaughan center and surpassed the 1.3 million mark in total training hours since the facility opened in 2010. This training is critical to our success because it helps us work smarter and safer. 
We also completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and are working on our high level road map for addressing gaps. While we have had components of a safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for years, the safety management system formalizes what we are doing and adds another layer of rigor and discipline for the identification and assessment of risk. It is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. 
Our employees continue to provide exceptional customer service at every opportunity. Our customers give us a 98% satisfaction rating for both our contact center agents and our service technician. These men and women are the heart, the soul and the face of Atmos Energy. I'm extremely proud of them and how well they represent us each and every opportunity. 
In addition to providing safe and reliable service and exceptional customer service, our employees support the communities where we live and work. In fiscal 2019, I'm proud to say that we donate nearly $5 million to various charitable causes as well as help our most vulnerable customers gain access to nearly $6 million of funding to help pay their heating bills. 
By all measures, fiscal 2019 was another successful year for Atmos Energy. I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to executing the ninth year of our successful strategy as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the biggest provider of natural gas services. 
This straightforward, focused and proven strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. The $10 billion to $11 billion capital spending plan over the next 5 years will continue to be in the areas of system modernization, system fortification, customer growth and technology that improves safety, drive efficiency and build scale. Over 85% of these investments will be focused on safety and reliability identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy. Continued emphasis will be placed on removing industrial identified materials such as bare steel, vintage plastic and [indiscernible] 
Atmos Pipeline Texas investments, in addition to safety, will focus on reliability, fortifying our ability to meet the growing demand, particularly here in our North Texas service territories. At the end of the 5-year investment period, our safe system will be significantly more modern. As you can see on Slide 27, we anticipate this level of filming will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of our last 400 miles of cast iron in our system by the end of 2021 and the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex division. We also plan to replace between 200,000 and 300,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by 29%. And 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading by the end of this period. 
Finally, this level of replacement is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 10% to 15% over the next 5 years. We continue to fine-tune our planning and forecasting capabilities, incorporating lessons learned and new requirements to ensure the work is done right and to further improve our ability to execute on our strategy. We have a proven track record of managing and growing these investments in a safe and responsible manner, because of our employees and our leaders. They have displayed the skills, experience training and have the technology to execute this strategy exceptionally well. Our management committee leads the execution of this strategy. This committee is supported by 7 divisional leadership team, each comprised of a President and Vice President, representing operational and financial areas of responsibility and a strong centralized shared service team. 
This somewhat unique structure helps us to ensure strong governance and executional oversight at the local level. And it also serves to internally develop a wide number of people for potentially more senior roles in the company. Our management team is supported by an engaged Board of Directors, the Board of Directors possesses a strong balance of experience to provide deep insights, strong governance and management oversight with a fresh perspective. During fiscal 2019, we further strengthened our board oversight with the establishment of the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee. This committee now monitors the current and emerging ESG landscape for issues that could materially affect our business and oversees all of our ESG efforts. 
Together, this positions Atmos Energy for sustained success in the future as we continue to provide safe, reliable efficient and affordable natural gas service to our 3 million customers and over 1,400 communities, all as we continue working in sync with our regulators to advance safety and reliability. Our culture, Atmos spirit, is the secret sauce that supports us and provides the necessary foundation for our continued success and our ability to execute consistently. Now 20 years old, Atmos spirit established the long-standing guiding principles of our culture today. These principles are inspire trust, be it your best, bring out the best in others, make a difference and focus on the future. Reflect the values, beliefs and behaviors we embrace as a company. 
In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees for their dedication to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and for giving back to the community where they live and work each and every day. They are the heart and soul of our company and the biggest reason Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term.

252684,639832447,1856778,"Atmos Energy Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Atmos Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 mi",1390,"Thank you, Chris. Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 miles of distribution pipeline and 5,700 miles of interstate pipeline provides safe and reliable service to our customers every day.
In addition to achieving our financial targets for fiscal 2019, we continue to modernize our system. In fiscal year 2019, as you saw on Slide 27, our team replaced about 775 -- 770 miles of distribution pipe, 120 miles of transmission pipe and 53,000 service lines across the 8 states in which we operate.
We continue to utilize technology to modernize our business. In fiscal 2019, we deployed new technology called Locus Map. That allows us to digitally capture our asset data as we complete our project. This technology is helping us to scale our operations and improve the quality and timeliness of our asset data collection requirements. At the end of fiscal 2019, this rollout was about 50% complete and on track to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2020.
We also continued our systematic rollout of advanced leak detection technology to enhance our ability to monitor our system, keep the public safe and to help us prioritize the pipe placement work.
At our customer support centers, we completed the implementation of new technology that we refer to as skills-based routing. Skills-based routing matches a caller to the customer support associate best suited to handle their needs by using predictive analytics within our SAP system. Our electronic billing continues to be one of the highest in the industry at 43%. Based on a 2019 American Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute benchmarking survey, our penetration for electronic billing was rated #1 for gas-only utility and #4 for all gas, electric and combination utility. We increased our electronic billing penetration by 2.4% in fiscal year 2019.
Also in fiscal year 2019, our Spanish account center was released along with an upgrade to our integrated voice response system.
These are just a few examples of the many initiatives we have in progress or completed as we modernize our system and our business. As you know, our vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services, and training is key to part of that vision. In 2019, we provided nearly 288,000 hours at our Charles K. Vaughan Center and surpassed the 1.3 million mark in total training hours since the facility opened in 2010. This training is critical to our success because it helps us work smarter and safer.
We also completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and are working on our high level road map for addressing gaps. While we have had components of a safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for years, the safety management system formalizes what we are doing and adds another layer of rigor and discipline for the identification and assessment of risk. It is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.
Our employees continued to provide exceptional customer service at every opportunity. Our customers give us a 98% satisfaction rating for both our contact center agents and our service technicians. These men and women are the heart, the soul and the face of Atmos Energy. I'm extremely proud of them in how well they represent us each and every opportunity.
In addition to providing safe and reliable service and exceptional customer service, our employees support the communities where we live and work. In fiscal 2019, I'm proud to say that we donated nearly $5 million to various charitable causes as well as helped our most vulnerable customers gain access to nearly $6 million of funding to help pay their heating bills.
By all measures, fiscal 2019 was another successful year for Atmos Energy. I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to executing the ninth year of our successful strategy as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.
This straightforward, focused and proven strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. The $10 billion to $11 billion capital spending plan over the next 5 years will continue to be in the areas of system modernization, system fortification, customer growth and technology that improves safety, drive efficiency and build scale. Over 85% of these investments will be focused on safety and reliability identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy. Continued emphasis will be placed on removing industrial identified materials such as bare steel, vintage plastics and cast iron.
Atmos Pipeline-Texas investments, in addition to safety, will focus on reliability, fortifying our ability to meet the growing demand, particularly here in our North Texas service territories.
At the end of the 5-year investment period, our safe system will be significantly more modern. As you can see on Slide 27, we anticipate this level of filming will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of our last 400 miles of cast iron in our system by the end of 2021 and the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex division. We also plan to replace between 200,000 and 300,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by 29%. And 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading by the end of this period.
Finally, this level of replacement is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 10% to 15% over the next 5 years.
We continue to fine-tune our planning and forecasting capabilities, incorporating lessons learned and new requirements to ensure the work is done right and to further improve our ability to execute on our strategy. We have a proven track record of managing and growing these investments in a safe and responsible manner because of our employees and our leaders. They have displayed the skills, experience, training and have the technology to execute this strategy exceptionally well. Our management committee leads the execution of this strategy. This committee is supported by 7 divisional leadership team, each comprised of a President and Vice President, representing operational and financial areas of responsibility and a strong centralized shared service team.
This somewhat unique structure helps us to ensure strong governance and executional oversight at the local level. And it also serves to internally develop a wide number of people for potentially more senior roles in the company. Our management team is supported by an engaged Board of Directors. The Board of Directors possesses a strong balance of experience to provide deep insights, strong governance and management oversight with a fresh perspective. During fiscal 2019, we further strengthened our Board oversight with the establishment of the corporate responsibility and sustainability committee. This committee now monitors the current and emerging ESG landscape for issues that could materially affect our business and oversees all of our ESG efforts.
Together, this positions Atmos Energy for sustained success in the future as we continue to provide safe, reliable, efficient and affordable natural gas service to our 3 million customers in over 1,400 communities, all as we continue working in sync with our regulators to advance safety and reliability. Our culture, Atmos spirit, is the secret sauce that supports us and provides the necessary foundation for our continued success and our ability to execute consistently. Now 20 years old, Atmos spirit established the long-standing guiding principles of our culture today. These principles are: inspire trust, be it your best, bring out the best in others, make a difference and focus on the future; reflect the values, beliefs and behaviors we embrace as a company.
In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees for their dedication to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and for giving back to the community where they live and work each and every day. They are the heart and soul of our company and the biggest reason Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term.

We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of rising",1734,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.
Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of rising earnings per share.
Slides 6 and 7 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.
Consolidated contribution margin rose about 5% or about $95 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, provided an incremental $80 million. Virtually all of these increases were our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi jurisdictions.
As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, our pipeline and storage segment benefited from the supply and demand dynamics that have impacted pricing in the Permian Basin over the last 12 to 18 months. We were able to capture a portion of the widened Waha to Katy spread, resulting in a $12 million increase over fiscal 2018. However, as expected, a new merchant pipeline came online mid-summer, and we saw narrower spread opportunities in the back half of the fourth quarter.
Finally, our distribution segment continued to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 37,000 customers, a 1.2% increase over last year.
Consolidated operating expenses rose approximately 6%, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and higher O&M spending attributed to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance activities and higher employee costs.
As we discussed last quarter, in fiscal 2019, we increased service-related headcount in our Mid-Tex division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we've continued to roll out -- our rollout of advanced leak survey technology. Although this rollout has modestly increased our O&M, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. Finally, we continue to increase the training provided to our employees to further enable them to operate our systems safely and reliably.
Consolidated capital spending increased 15% to $1.7 billion with 87% of our spending directed toward investments to improve the safety and reliability of our system. Our ability to support this level of capital spending is due in part to the various regulatory mechanisms we have in place to minimize regulatory lag. During fiscal 2019, over 85% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $117 million in annualized operating income increases through 23 regulatory proceedings.
Since September 30, we have implemented an additional $57 million through 6 regulatory proceedings that were filed in the back half of fiscal 2019. As of today, we have 4 filings pending seeking about $6 million. Slides 39 to 53 summarize our regulatory activities for fiscal 2019.
Our ability to support this level of capital spending is also predicated on our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our ongoing capital expenditure program while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we continue to utilize equity forward agreements executed under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 equity needs.
We issued 1.4 million shares at an average price of $108.70. Additionally, we sold forward agreements for $1.1 million -- or 1.1 million shares with net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of September 30, 2019, we had about $463 million remaining under equity forward arrangements.
This issuance completed a very busy financing year where we were able to successfully raise over $2 billion of debt and equity financing. In the process, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 5.21% to 4.58%, and increased our weighted average maturities from 16 years to 22 years, helping to ensure our customers benefit from the current low interest rate environment for years to come. And our equity capitalization increased 230 basis points to 59% as of September 30.
We finished the fiscal year with approximately $1.6 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. Details of our financing activities, including our effort arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 9 to 11.
Looking forward, fiscal 2020 will represent the ninth year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution transition storage systems. Our plan is summarized on Slide 13. We expect fiscal 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share, with about 68% of our earnings coming from our distribution segment. By fiscal 2024, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.30 per diluted share.
Slides 14 and 15 present some of the details supporting our fiscal 2020 guidance. O&M is expected to be in line with fiscal 2019. Our O&M will continue to be focused on risk-based activities that address system safety and compliance. These activities include enhanced leak survey, pipeline integrity work and continued record establishment and retention. It also includes spending for work to help us set a baseline of understanding of our system before PHMSA's new integrity management rules go into effect on July 1, 2020. As we've discussed in the past, we have been anticipating these rules for a few years and reflected that activity in our future O&M projections. As a result, some of the last year's 5-year plan, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 2.5% to 3.5% annually.
Depreciation will rise due to high level of capital spending. Interest expense was lower as we reduced our weighted average cost of debt and expect to capitalize more interest through AFUDC. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in fiscal 2020, inclusive of the impact of amortizing our excess deferred tax liabilities. Excluding this amortization, we anticipate the effective tax rate to range from 23% to 25%.
Fiscal 2020 capital spending is expected to rise about 12% and range between $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, with approximately 86% of the spending dedicated to safety and reliability spending. Approximately 73% of this spending will be allocated to our distribution segment. Almost 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to be earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.
Continued spending for system replacement and modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal 2024. As you can see on Slide 17, we anticipate capital spending to increase 7% to 8% per year off the fiscal 2019 spend levels for a total of $10 billion to $11 billion over the next 5 years. This level of spending is expected to approximate 4x depreciation annually. This should result in rate base growth of about 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $17 billion to $18 billion in fiscal 2024, up from about $9 billion at the end of fiscal 2019 as you can see on Slide 18.
Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract new capital needed to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to our customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We've assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal 2024.
In fiscal 2020, we anticipate completing filings for $160 million to $180 million of annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
Moving to Slide 20. In light of our financial performance for fiscal 2019, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved our 144th consecutive quarterly cash dividend yesterday. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2020 is $2.30, a 9.5% increase over fiscal 2019.
We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next 5 years, and we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50%. And it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing a return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. This 5-year plan continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors while preserving our strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing for our customers.
Based on our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing in order to maintain a balanced capital structure. They've targeted every capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized on Slide 21. And consistent with prior plans, our financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2024.
In October, we got off to a great start towards executing this plan with the issuance of $800 million in long-term debt. We issued a mix of 10-year and third year notes to achieve a weighted average cost of debt of 3.18% in this offer. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt decreased another 26 basis points to 4.32%.
From an equity perspective, we announced during fiscal 2019 that we did not perceive the need for a discrete equity issuance in fiscal 2020. The equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2019 are expected to satisfy a substantial portion of our equity needs for the fiscal year. We expect to remain -- raise the remaining equity needs for fiscal 2020 through our ATM program.
In closing, the execution of our operating plans to modernize our systems with disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends per share 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2024. And as you can see on Slides 22 and 23, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which helps us sustain this plan for the long -term.

We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of rising",1735,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.
Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of rising earnings per share.
Slides 6 and 7 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.
Consolidated contribution margin rose about 5% or about $95 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, provided an incremental $80 million. Virtually all of these increases were our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi jurisdictions.
As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, our pipeline and storage segment benefited from the supply and demand dynamics that have impacted pricing in the Permian Basin over the last 12 to 18 months. We were able to capture a portion of the widened Waha to Katy spread, resulting in a $12 million increase over fiscal 2018. However, as expected, a new merchant pipeline came online mid-summer, and we saw narrower spread opportunities in the back half of the fourth quarter.
Finally, our distribution segment continued to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 37,000 customers, a 1.2% increase over last year.
Consolidated operating expenses rose approximately 6%, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and higher O&M spending attributed to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance activities and higher employee costs.
As we discussed last quarter, in fiscal 2019, we increased service-related head count in our Mid-Tex division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we've continued to roll out -- our rollout of advanced leak survey technology. Although this rollout has modestly increased our O&M, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. Finally, we continue to increase the training provided to our employees to further enable them to operate our systems safely and reliably.
Consolidated capital spending increased 15% to $1.7 billion with 87% of our spending directed toward investments to improve the safety and reliability of our system. Our ability to support this level of capital spending is due in part to the various regulatory mechanisms we have in place to minimize regulatory lag. During fiscal 2019, over 85% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $117 million in annualized operating income increases through 23 regulatory proceedings.
Since September 30, we have implemented an additional $57 million through 6 regulatory proceedings that were filed in the back half of fiscal 2019. As of today, we have 4 filings pending seeking about $6 million. Slides 39 to 53 summarize our regulatory activities for fiscal 2019.
Our ability to support this level of capital spending is also predicated on our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our ongoing capital expenditure program while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we continue to utilize equity forward agreements executed under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 equity needs.
We issued 1.4 million shares at an average price of $108.70. Additionally, we sold forward agreements for $1.1 million -- or 1.1 million shares with net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of September 30, 2019, we had about $463 million remaining under equity forward arrangements.
This issuance completed a very busy financing year where we were able to successfully raise over $2 billion of debt and equity financing. In the process, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 5.21% to 4.58%, and increased our weighted average maturities from 16 years to 22 years, helping to ensure our customers benefit from the current low interest rate environment for years to come. And our equity capitalization increased 230 basis points to 59% as of September 30.
We finished the fiscal year with approximately $1.6 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. Details of our financing activities, including our effort arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 9 to 11.
Looking forward, fiscal 2020 will represent the ninth year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution transition storage systems. Our plan is summarized on Slide 13. We expect fiscal 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share, with about 68% of our earnings coming from our distribution segment. By fiscal 2024, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.30 per diluted share.
Slides 14 and 15 present some of the details supporting our fiscal 2020 guidance. O&M is expected to be in line with fiscal 2019. Our O&M will continue to be focused on risk-based activities that address system safety and compliance. These activities include enhanced leak survey, pipeline integrity work and continued record establishment and retention. It also includes spending for work to help us set a baseline of understanding of our system before PHMSA's new integrity management rules go into effect on July 1, 2020. As we've discussed in the past, we have been anticipating these rules for a few years and reflected that activity in our future O&M projections. As a result, some of the last year's 5-year plan, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 2.5% to 3.5% annually.
Depreciation will rise due to high level of capital spending. Interest expense was lower as we reduced our weighted average cost of debt and expect to capitalize more interest through AFUDC. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in fiscal 2020, inclusive of the impact of amortizing our excess deferred tax liabilities. Excluding this amortization, we anticipate the effective tax rate to range from 23% to 25%.
Fiscal 2020 capital spending is expected to rise about 12% and range between $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, with approximately 86% of the spending dedicated to safety and reliability spending. Approximately 73% of this spending will be allocated to our distribution segment. Almost 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to be earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.
Continued spending for system replacement and modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal 2024. As you can see on Slide 17, we anticipate capital spending to increase 7% to 8% per year off the fiscal 2019 spend levels for a total of $10 billion to $11 billion over the next 5 years. This level of spending is expected to approximate 4x depreciation annually. This should result in rate base growth of about 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $17 billion to $18 billion in fiscal 2024, up from about $9 billion at the end of fiscal 2019 as you can see on Slide 18.
Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract new capital needed to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to our customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We've assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal 2024.
In fiscal 2020, we anticipate completing filings for $160 million to $180 million of annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
Moving to Slide 20. In light of our financial performance for fiscal 2019, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved our 144th consecutive quarterly cash dividend yesterday. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2020 is $2.30, a 9.5% increase over fiscal 2019.
We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next 5 years, and we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50%. And it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing a return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. This 5-year plan continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors while preserving our strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing for our customers.
Based on our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing in order to maintain a balanced capital structure. They've targeted every capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized on Slide 21. And consistent with prior plans, our financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2024.
In October, we got off to a great start towards executing this plan with the issuance of $800 million in long-term debt. We issued a mix of 10-year and third year notes to achieve a weighted average cost of debt of 3.18% in this offer. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt decreased another 26 basis points to 4.32%.
From an equity perspective, we announced during fiscal 2019 that we did not perceive the need for a discrete equity issuance in fiscal 2020. The equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2019 are expected to satisfy a substantial portion of our equity needs for the fiscal year. We expect to remain -- raise the remaining equity needs for fiscal 2020 through our ATM program.
In closing, the execution of our operating plans to modernize our systems with disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends per share 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2024. And as you can see on Slides 22 and 23, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which helps us sustain this plan for the long -term.
Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his prepared remarks."

Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 mi",1388,"Thank you, Chris. Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 miles of distribution pipeline and 5,700 miles of interstate pipeline provides safe and reliable service to our customers every day.
In addition to achieving our financial targets for fiscal 2019, we continue to modernize our system. In fiscal year 2019, as you saw on Slide 27, our team replaced about 775 -- 770 miles of distribution pipe, 120 miles of transmission pipe and 53,000 service lines across the 8 states in which we operate.
We continue to utilize technology to modernize our business. In fiscal 2019, we deployed new technology called Locus Map. That allows us to digitally capture our asset data as we complete our project. This technology is helping us to scale our operations and improve the quality and timeliness of our asset data collection requirements. At the end of fiscal 2019, this rollout was about 50% complete and on track to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2020.
We also continued our systematic rollout of advanced leak detection technology to enhance our ability to monitor our system, keep the public safe and to help us prioritize the pipe replacement work.
At our customer support centers, we completed the implementation of new technology that we refer to as skills-based routing. Skills-based routing matches a caller to the customer support associate best suited to handle their needs by using predictive analytics within our SAP system. Our electronic billing continues to be one of the highest in the industry at 43%. Based on a 2019 American Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute benchmarking survey, our penetration for electronic billing was rated #1 for gas-only utility and #4 for all gas, electric and combination utility. We increased our electronic billing penetration by 2.4% in fiscal year 2019.
Also in fiscal year 2019, our Spanish account center was released along with an upgrade to our integrated voice response system.
These are just a few examples of the many initiatives we have in progress or completed as we modernize our system and our business. As you know, our vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services, and training is key to part of that vision. In 2019, we provided nearly 288,000 hours at our Charles K. Vaughan Center and surpassed the 1.3 million mark in total training hours since the facility opened in 2010. This training is critical to our success because it helps us work smarter and safer.
We also completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and are working on our high-level road map for addressing gaps. While we have had components of a safety management system, including procedures, policies and practices for years, the safety management system formalizes what we are doing and adds another layer of rigor and discipline for the identification and assessment of risk. It is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.
Our employees continue to provide exceptional customer service at every opportunity. Our customers give us a 98% satisfaction rating for both our contact center agents and our service technicians. These men and women are the heart, the soul and the face of Atmos Energy. I'm extremely proud of them in how well they represent us each and every opportunity.
In addition to providing safe and reliable service and exceptional customer service, our employees support the communities where we live and work. In fiscal 2019, I'm proud to say that we donated nearly $5 million to various charitable causes as well as helped our most vulnerable customers gain access to nearly $6 million of funding to help pay their heating bills.
By all measures, fiscal 2019 was another successful year for Atmos Energy. I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to executing the ninth year of our successful strategy as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.
This straightforward focused and proven strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. The $10 billion to $11 billion capital spending plan over the next 5 years will continue to be in the areas of system modernization, system fortification, customer growth and technology that improves safety, drives efficiency and builds scale. Over 85% of these investments will be focused on safety and reliability identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy. Continued emphasis will be placed on removing industrial identified materials such as bare steel, vintage plastics and cast iron.
Atmos Pipeline-Texas investments, in addition to safety, will focus on reliability, fortifying our ability to meet the growing demand, particularly here in our North Texas service territories.
At the end of the 5-year investment period, our safe system will be significantly more modern. As you can see on Slide 27, we anticipate this level of filming will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of our last 400 miles of cast iron in our system by the end of 2021 and the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex division. We also plan to replace between 200,000 and 300,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by 29%. And 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading by the end of this period.
Finally, this level of replacement is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 10% to 15% over the next 5 years.
We continue to fine-tune our planning and forecasting capabilities, incorporating lessons learned and new requirements to ensure the work is done right and to further improve our ability to execute on our strategy. We have a proven track record of managing and growing these investments in a safe and responsible manner because of our employees and our leaders. They have displayed the skills, experience, training and have the technology to execute this strategy exceptionally well. Our management committee leads the execution of this strategy. This committee is supported by 7 divisional leadership teams, each comprised of a President and Vice President, representing operational and financial areas of responsibility and a strong centralized shared service team.
This somewhat unique structure helps us to ensure strong governance and executional oversight at the local level. And it also serves to internally develop a wide number of people for potentially more senior roles in the company. Our management team is supported by an engaged Board of Directors. The Board of Directors possesses a strong balance of experience to provide deep insights, strong governance and management oversight with a fresh perspective. During fiscal 2019, we further strengthened our Board oversight with the establishment of the corporate responsibility and sustainability committee. This committee now monitors the current and emerging ESG landscape for issues that could materially affect our business and oversees all of our ESG efforts.
Together, this positions Atmos Energy for sustained success in the future as we continue to provide safe, reliable, efficient and affordable natural gas service to our 3 million customers in over 1,400 communities, all as we continue working in sync with our regulators to advance safety and reliability. Our culture, Atmos spirit, is the secret sauce that supports us and provides the necessary foundation for our continued success and our ability to execute consistently. Now 20 years old, Atmos spirit established the long-standing guiding principles of our culture today. These principles are: inspire trust, be it your best, bring out the best in others, make a difference and focus on the future; reflect the values, beliefs and behaviors we embrace as a company.
In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees for their dedication to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and for giving back to the community where they live and work each and every day. They are the heart and soul of our company and the biggest reason Atmos Energy will be successful for the long-term.
We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll take any questions you may have."
