Thank you for joining us for our year-end 2018 call. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees and those of other utilities who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent polar vortex. Our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100% during the week. The investment reliability made on our system made a difference and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers and temperatures that reach a negative 23 degrees without including the windchill factor. I'll start on Slide 5. 2018 was a great year for Exelon and its operating companies. We executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers, communities and shareholders. We are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019. Our financial performance was strong. Full year GAAP earnings were $2.07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were $3.12 per share, well ahead of the original guidance range. Joe will walk through the details later in the call. 
Last year, we shared our goals for 2018 and I'm proud to report we're able to meet those commitments. Utility and generation operations have best performance in multiple categories. I'll get to those details in a few minutes. Last year, Exelon Utilities invested more than $5.5 billion in capital primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience as well as improved reliability and resiliency, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores. We are also effective on the regulatory front completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018. Cage, I was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases including Pepco in Maryland and DC for the first time since 1980s. We share the benefit of tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than $675 million on an annual basis. Working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continued to improve customer service. On the policy front, the second and seventh circuit court upheld the ZEC program in New York and Illinois. Although the plaintiffs have appealed to the Supreme Court, we expect these rulings to stand. New Jersey enacted the ZEC legislation which will start this spring and we're still focused on preserving nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. The Public Utility Commission of Texas adopted the changes to the OR DC curve earlier this year. We are waiting a decision from FERC on PJM our proposal and on PJM's capacity market reform. And PJM is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months. These policies, each in their own way, better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet with the value it provides by addressing clause in the existing energy and capacity markets. We are growing our dividend by 5% each year to 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to $1.45 per share on Monday. We're dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve and an important part of who we are and what we do.
As part of our partnership with you and initiative, we had an unarguable stem initiative leadership academies for teenagers in Chicago and Washington D.C. 95 girls participated in the week-long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about stem. We're expanding this program in 2019. And 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism in contributions. Our employees volunteered more than 240,000 hours last year, on average, 7 hours per employee and donated nearly $13 million. In addition Exelon donated more than $51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34,000 employees. We were named a Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Black Enterprise Magazine, Diversity Inc. and the Human Rights Campaign. We're also recognized for our environmental stewardship. We received a score of A- on both the CDP climate change and water surveys, the highest by any utility for each. We are named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th year in a row and we had a series of commitments for the 2018 we delivered on the task is for 2019 is beginning as big and I will cover those at the end of the call.
On Slide 6, we show the impact that Exelon management model has had on our utility operations. Each of our utilities have materially improved their operations since the merger with Constellation or PHI. To put this chart in perspective, ComEd has improved its overall reliability 60% since 2012. The hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off. In 2018, all 4 of our utilities ended up in top quartile for safety or outage frequency performance with ComEd at top decile and PHI matching its best performance on record. Each utility achieved top quartile on CAIDI or outage duration except PECO which missed top quartile by only 1 minute. BGE and ComEd performed in top decile. BGE and PECO had top decile performance in gas odor response for the sixth consecutive year and PHI delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row. This level of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers but we still have more work to do to confront climate change and our customer demands. Customer satisfaction was top quartile at at least 3 of the 4 utilities. ComEd, BGE and PHI had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction. ComEd and PHI scored in top decile for service level, and BGE and PHI had their best performance on record. Our utilities in the Mid-Atlantic operated extremely well in the face of record-breaking rainfall. DC saw more than 5.5 feet of rain, Baltimore 6 feet and Philadelphia 8 feet of rain during last year. Our safety metrics improved over the year as result of the actions we're taking to correct course. We will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area. 
Turning to our competitive business on Slide 7. Our generation fleet performed very well in 2018 providing abundance of clean electricity that our country needs. In fact, Exelon generated 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States, more than twice as many any other generator. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 94.6, exceeding 94% for the third year in a row in 5 out of the last 6 years. We generated the motion to clear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours, avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Our average outage duration was 21 days, a new Exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average. Exelon powers gas and hydro dispatch matched 98.1% and wind and solar captured 96.1% were better than planned. In October, we acquired the Everett LNG import facility and in December, we received a cost of service order from FERC for Mystic unit 8 and 9, which together will allow us to provide fuel security in New England market through May of 2024. Our Mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in January and February of last year. At Constellation, our C&I operating metrics remain strong. 78% customer renewal rates, averaged customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 24 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continue to focus on cost is helping us support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers. That relationship is more than just powering gas but it's built on Constellation's unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance. Starting with Slide #8. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we are in $0.16 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 above our original midpoint. Exelon Utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues with the only resolution of rate cases at Pepco and favorable weather. This was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms. ExGen performed in line with guidance, realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018 including higher allocated transmission costs. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Turning to Slide 9. It shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes. Across our utility, we received final orders in 8 distribution cases. We reached settlements in 6 of the cases at PECO, Delmarva Delaware on the electric and gas side; Delmarva Maryland and Pepco Maryland in DC, which is the first time we've had settlements at Pepco since the 1980s. Additionally, ComEd received 100% of its task for the second year in a row and finally in early January, the Maryland PSC approved 70% of the ask in BGE's gas distribution case. Our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we compared the 2018 trailing 12-month blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs to 2017. Our constructive rate case results and the roll-off of the FAS 109 charge drove the improved earned returns this year. We are encouraged by PHI's ongoing improvement with earned ROEs improving by 70 to 140 basis points. Exelon utilities earned a combined 9.7% ROE, up year-over-year. We remain focused on achieving our utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned ROEs at PHI's and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. We expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9% to 10% range in 2019.
On Slide 11, we roll forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022. Since the merger with PHI in 2016, we have invested more than $16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly $23 million over the next 4 years. As Chris said, these investments are improving our system reliability, service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future. As a reminder, the CapEx budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we generally find more investment due to additional system needs. When we compare our 2019 to 2021 CapEx outlook versus the same period last year, we plan to invest an additional $1.5 billion of CapEx for the benefit of our customers. This additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility, ComEd. Since the PHI merger, we have added nearly $6 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.8% annually to $50.7 billion, adding $13.1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. Rate base has grown slightly faster than the 7.4% growth we projected last year.
As a reminder, the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. These support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on Slide 22. 
As you turn to Slide 12, we continue to forecast strong utility less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%, even for the elevated -- even from the elevated 2018 starting point where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range -- we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 per share. Compared to last year, the outlook for 2019 to '21 has improved with all bands increasing by $0.05 per share. The durability of our industry-leading earnings growth reflect a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for more digital economy and growing environmental goals, along with concerted efforts to manage cost and a focus on modest customer bill inflation.
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company. There is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin increased $50 million due to improving spark spreads at ERCOT as well as higher prices at New York Zone 8 and 9 hubs which were offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in in powering new business. In 2020, Open Gross Margin is up $150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions. Given our hedged position and execution of a $100 million of new business, total gross margin increased by $50 million since last quarter. We are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down $250 million compared to 2020. The decline reflects lower power crisis in PJM and ERCOT, plus lower capacity revenues in New England and PJM. Our power and nonpower new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with prior years. I should point out that these disclosures are based on 12/31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ORDC curve changes in Texas. We remain behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020, while we are $0.02 to $0.05 -- 2% to 5% behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross-commodity hedges. Our open market length is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. We're comfortable maintaining a more open position given our balance sheet.
Slide 14 shows are O&M and capital outlook at Generation. Our O&M forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the Everett Marine Terminal that serves our Mystic needs. Like others, the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns resulting in increased cost going forward. In total, these updates have added $75 million in O&M cost or about a 6% -- or $0.06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021. However, even with these cost pressures, we expect to see a 1% annual decline in O&M over the next 4 years. Compared to our previous disclosure, our 2019 to 2021 CapEx is up modestly. In 2019, due to timing delays for our midway plant and some retail customer site at solar. In 2020, with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices where we had hedged with colors. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Slide 15 rolls forward exchange available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022. We expect cumulative available cash flow to be $7.8 billion which is $200 million higher than our previous 4-year outlook. We will use the available cash flow from ExGen to primarily fund the increased utility investment, pay down debt and cover a small portion in the dividends. We will invest approximately $600 million in growth capital which is primarily customers-cited solar projects at Constellation and as I mentioned, the completion of the West Midway plant in New England this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we have identified additional capital investment in our utilities. As a result, we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities for next-gen by $700 million to a range of $4 billion to $4.4 billion. We will use between $300 million and $500 million of ExGen's free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities. As the utilities continue to grow, ExGen's portion of the dividend decreased even as the dividend itself grows. Finally, we have planned to retire between $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of debt with our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets. We felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reductions to instead support the higher value-added and needed investments at our utilities. A big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity markets. This remains a differentiated advantage to our peers. 
Moving on to Slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit ratings. We are comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for debt and well above the agency to downgrade thresholds. As you are aware, Exelon and its operating companies are on CreditWatch Positive at both S&P and Fitch. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x in 2019. We expect to be at 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. We are actively following the PGE bankruptcy process. PGE's a sole off taker of our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, or AVSR Facilities, which was funded by Exelon's DOE loans and project financing that are nonrecourse to Exelon. We, along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with PG&E, recently received a FERC order affirming the commission's role to approve any modifications to existing PPAs which PG&E is challenged in the bankruptcy court. We will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of AVSR and the role that assets like ours like having California clean energy future. From an earnings perspective, AVSR provides $0.03 per share to Exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics given the nonrecourse project we mentioned. Finally, I will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deployed capital for the benefit of our consumers, last year's completed rate case and improvements in PHI as ROE. The decline in generation earnings is a combination of normalized Illinois ZEC revenues as we recognized $0.11 of 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices which are partially offset by increased ZEC revenues in New Jersey and New York as well as a fewer planned nuclear outages. As you think about 2019 earnings, the most notable new updates include: the $0.05 per share increased to our utility earnings stance; the $0.02 to $0.03 of pension expense at ExGen due to worse-than-expected planned performance in 2018 as well as roughly $0.03 per share drag from the recent Everett LNG facility acquisition which represents a negative near-term impact but is a positive value driver in the future with the Mystic cost to service contract beginning in 2022. These impacts are reflected in our O&M and other expense data in the appendix. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the Appendix starting on Slide 61. I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments."

Turning to Slide 18, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on organizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our generation fleet safely and reliably. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment-grade rating. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $5.3 billion of capital to benefit our customers and we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9% to 10% earned ROEs across Exelon utility families by year-end. Building upon successes in Delaware, DC, Maryland and Pennsylvania, we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and our commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers. At Generation, a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that failed to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits. As you know, we plan to retire TMI later this year and as a reminder, all of the Dresden and portions of the Braidwood and Byron plants did not clear last year's PJM auction. We will continue to engage with stakeholders on state policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level. We will support PJM price formation, changes like Fast Start and reserve market reforms with our stakes to implement the expected FERC order on PJM's capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policy and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for a zero emitting nuclear plants. We'll continue to grow our dividend at 5% annually through 2020 and we'll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve. Being a good corporate citizen for our customers, communities, and employees is key to who we are. Finally, turning to Slide 19, I will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders. We have updated some of the numbers but the proposal -- proposition remains the same. We'll continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting a 7.8% growth -- rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022, rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory. We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund a part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize value our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it make sense to accelerate debt-reduction plans and maximizing value through the Gen II load match strategy at Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics and will grow the dividend annually at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpins this value proposition is effective and providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. We are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside though neither policy and market reforms are required. We are very confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at Exelon. With that, operator, we can now open the call up to questions. Thank you."

We -- when we put our capital plans together at LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M and if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it's about 0.3% increase over that 4-year period and we always look at affordability. And we got 8 bills on the distribution rate side and 4 of them -- excuse me, 3 of them are roughly flat over that period that we've showed you. 4 of them are trending less than inflation and 1 of them will come of them right at inflation, and that's a combination of managing our O&M and also our energy efficiency programs which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here. So that's basically what we're looking at in terms of affordability. The other question that we ask ourselves is, are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates, and so we've been looking hard at the low-income side and a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low income programs along with it. So that's what we're looking at in terms of affordability builds that are staying at or well below inflation, and also looking at low income. In terms of looking forward, we think about investment in really 3 buckets. One is reliability and resiliency, just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems, the safety of our systems and as the economy changes and we've got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system, how do you ensure that, that's reliable and resilient. The second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation. We've got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we'll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile. So thinking about sensors on the system, artificial intelligence, distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to 6 to 8 cycles, that sort of thing. And then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system in expectation of that kind of shift. So those are the areas that we think about and look out. We want our stakeholders very closely. We're starting to see legislation and policy come out of DC in December, a big piece of policy there. The Pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in January and so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they're directing us."

When you look at the gross margin in '21 versus '20, there's -- the 2 big drivers, very simply, are as you mentioned, one is the backward-dated price curve and obviously, for us the biggest impact is at Hub and West Hub and Jim could talk for a while about what we're doing, we're aggressively managing our portfolio. You see that we're behind our ratable plan. Actual spot prices last year obviously, were very, very strong. And then secondly, Kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as PGM and others so I don't think the story has been fully written there, and obviously, we have a very large open position. The second piece of it is driven really by capacity and some of it is in New England where the prices were lower year-over-year and in PJM where we had lower volumes cleared year-over-year. But from my lens, I think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility and hedging is -- less hedging is an example of that and through time, we have continued to improve our earnings and we'll continue to work hard to do that in '21."

Let me start by giving you a sense of what the investment patterns look like and what sort of, I think, driving the trending that you're seeing, and then between Joe and I, we'll talk about the ROEs. There's a couple of things that are happening there. One of the things that we've done in the last year, so we've gone through an accelerated our gas main replacement programs. We moved them from 30 years to 20 years and so you're seeing an acceleration of the gas investments so that's one of the pieces that you're seeing trending there. One of the things that we're doing at PECO now is we looking at some material conditions upgrades but we are also doing a program to upgrade 4 KV theaters to 12 KV theaters in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system. You just can't put that stuff on the kind of some of the theaters we've got in place right now. So that's one of the areas we're looking at. Another program at PECO is really enhancing the underground replacement program, again underground cable program against the material condition where, I think, you're pretty familiar with most of the PHI work, we've got DC plug that we're getting started and we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in December. At BGE, we've got some new EV investments that's coming through after the order that just came out of that commission, so some additional capital investment there. At ComEd, we're expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place. We're doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments. We've got about program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that's about $900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our IT system to get ready for again, a more flexible dynamic risk. So those are some of the things that you are looking at that's driving that capital trend."

It is hard to put a pinpoint number on it. The way we're looking at it right now is even before the ORDC change, we've been talking about the tighter reserve margin and you've seen the CDR reports and we're in agreement with where they're coming in now that the reserve margins for this upcoming summer looked like they are somewhere between 7% and 8%. So I think with the ORDC changes, you're just making that likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role in where the summer prices go. We've seen the forward market move-up since the end of Q3, about $15 for summer on peak. Over the last month over so, it's been more up and down may be a little higher but more flattish. So I think the market has been moving around it's x base station of just how many scarcity hours there's going to be, which to your point is a hard thing to predict. Obviously, it depends on whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outage or variable win. The one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at $9,000 is a $1 on the Cal ATC price. It's about $13 or $14 on the summer on peak price. So I think what we're going to see in the market do is really trade it at a pretty volatile range at the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be to drive that summer $15 at  the time just by adding an hour or 2. So to put an estimate on it right now, is really to say how many hours we think there's going to be. But I think the way we to increase the likelihood and send the right price signal in times of tight market conditions."

Thank you for joining us for our year-end 2018 call. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees and those of other utilities, who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent polar vortex. Our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100% during the week. The investment on reliability made on our system made a difference, and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached a negative 23 degrees without including the windchill factor. 
I'll start on Slide 5. 2018 was a great year for Exelon and its operating companies. We executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers, communities and shareholders. We are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019. Our financial performance was strong. Full year GAAP earnings were $2.07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were $3.12 per share, well ahead of the original guidance range. Joe will walk through the details later in the call. 
Last year, we shared our goals for 2018, and I'm proud to report we're able to meet those commitments. Utility and Generation operations had best performance in multiple categories. I'll get to those details in a few minutes. Last year, Exelon Utilities invested more than $5.5 billion in capital primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience as well as improved reliability and resiliency, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We were also effective on the regulatory front, completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018. PHI was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases, including Pepco in Maryland and D.C. for the first time since 1980s. We share the benefit of a tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than $675 million on an annual basis. Working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continued to improve customer service. 
On the policy front, the Second and Seventh Circuit Court upheld the ZEC program in New York and Illinois. Although the plaintiffs have appealed to the Supreme Court, we expect these rulings to stand. New Jersey enacted the ZEC legislation, which will start this spring. And we're still focused on preserving nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. 
The Public Utility Commission of Texas adopted the changes to the ORDC curve earlier this year. We are awaiting a decision from FERC on PJM's Fast Start proposal and on PJM's capacity market reform. And PJM is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months. These policies, each in their own way, better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet with the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets. 
We are growing our dividend by 5% each year through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to $1.45 per share on Monday. We're dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve and an important part of who we are and what we do.  
As part of our partnership with the UN HeForShe initiative, we held an inaugural STEM initiative leadership academies for teenagers in Chicago and Washington, D.C. 95 girls participated in a week-long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about STEM. We're expanding this program in 2019. And 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions. Our employees volunteered more than 240,000 hours last year, on average, 7 hours per employee and donated nearly $13 million. In addition, Exelon donated more than $51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint. 
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34,000 employees. We were named a Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Black Enterprise magazine, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. We were also recognized for our environmental stewardship. We received a score of A- on both the CDP climate change and water surveys, the highest by any utility for each. We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th year in a row. And we had a series of commitments for the 2018 we delivered on. The task is for 2019 is beginning as big. And I will cover those at the end of the call.
On Slide 6, we show the impact that Exelon management model has had on our Utility operations. Each of our utilities have materially improved their operations since the merger with Constellation or PHI. To put this chart in perspective, ComEd has improved its overall reliability 60% since 2012. The hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off. In 2018, all 4 of our utilities ended up in top quartile for safety or outage frequency performance with ComEd at top decile and PHI matching its best performance on record. Each utility achieved top quartile on CAIDI or outage duration, except PECO, which missed top quartile by only 1 minute. 
BGE and ComEd performed in top decile. BGE and PECO had top decile performance in gas odor response for the sixth consecutive year and PHI delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row. This level of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers. But we still have more work to do to confront climate change and our customer demands. Customer satisfaction was top quartile at, at least 3 of the 4 utilities. ComEd, BGE and PHI had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction. ComEd and PHI scored in top decile for service level and BGE and PHI had their best performance on record. 
Our utilities in the Mid-Atlantic operated extremely well in the face of record-breaking rainfall. D.C. saw more than 5.5 feet of rain, Baltimore 6 feet and Philadelphia 8 feet of rain during last year. Our safety metrics improved over the year as result of the actions we're taking to correct course. We will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area. 
Turning to our competitive business on Slide 7. Our Generation fleet performed very well in 2018, providing abundance of clean electricity that our country needs. In fact, Exelon generated 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States, more than twice as many any other generator. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 94.6%, exceeding 94% for the third year in a row in 5 out of the last 6 years. We generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours, avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Our average outage duration was 21 days, a new Exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average. 
Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 98.1% and wind and solar captured 96.1% were better than planned. In October, we acquired the Everett LNG import facility. And in December, we received a cost-of-service order from FERC for Mystic Unit 8 and 9, which together will allow us to provide fuel security in New England market through May of 2024. Our Mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in January and February of last year. 
At Constellation, our C&I operating metrics remained strong: 78% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 24 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continue to focus on cost is helping us support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers. That relationship is more than just powering gas but is built on Constellation's unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. 
Now I'll turn it over to Joe."
296181,597786261,1651499,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2019",2019-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.

For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a",1982,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance. 
Starting with Slide #8. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 above our original midpoint. 
Exelon Utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues, with the early resolution of rate cases at Pepco and favorable weather. This was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms. ExGen performed in line with guidance. Realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018, including higher allocated transmission costs. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Turning to Slide 9. It shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes. Across our utilities, we received final orders in 8 distribution cases. We reached settlements in 6 of the cases at PECO; Delmarva Delaware on the electric and gas sides; Delmarva Maryland; and Pepco Maryland and D.C., which is the first time we've had settlements at Pepco since the 1980s. Additionally, ComEd received 100% of its ask for the second year in a row. And finally in early January, the Maryland PSC approved 70% of the ask in BGE's gas distribution case. Our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we compare the 2018 trailing 12-month blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs to 2017. Our constructive rate case results and the roll-off of the FAS 109 charge drove the improved earned returns this year. We are encouraged by PHI's ongoing improvement with earned ROEs improving by 70 to 140 basis points. Exelon Utilities earned a combined 9.7% ROE, up year-over-year. We remain focused on achieving our Utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. We expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9% to 10% range in 2019.
On Slide 11, we roll forward our outlook for Utility CapEx and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022. Since the merger with PHI in 2016, we have invested more than $16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly $23 billion over the next 4 years. As Chris said, these investments are improving our system reliability, service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future. 
As a reminder, the CapEx budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we generally find more investment due to additional system needs. When we compare our 2019 to 2021 CapEx outlook versus the same period last year, we plan to invest an additional $1.5 billion of CapEx for the benefit of our customers. This additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility, ComEd. 
Since the PHI merger, we have added nearly $6 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.8% annually to $50.7 billion, adding $13.1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. Rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7.4% growth we projected last year.  
As a reminder, the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. These support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 22. 
As you turn to Slide 12, we continue to forecast strong Utility less holding company EPS growth of 6% to 8%, even for the elevated -- even from the elevated 2018 starting point, where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range -- we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 per share. Compared to last year, the outlook for 2019 to '21 has improved with all bands increasing by $0.05 per share. The durability of our industry-leading earnings growth reflect a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for more digital economy and growing environmental goals, along with concerted efforts to manage cost and a focus on modest customer bill inflation.
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. There is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure. Open Gross Margin increased $50 million due to improving spark spreads at ERCOT as well as higher prices at New York Zone A and NiHub, which were offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in power new business. In 2020, Open Gross Margin is up $150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions. Given our hedged position and execution of a $100 million of new business, total gross margin increased by $50 million since last quarter. 
We are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down $250 million compared to 2020. The decline reflects lower power crisis in PJM and ERCOT plus lower capacity revenues in New England and PJM. Our power and non-power new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with the prior years. I should point out that these disclosures are based on 12/31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ORDC curve changes in Texas. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 while we're $0.02 to $0.05 -- 2% to 5% behind ratable in 2021, when considering cross-commodity hedges. Our open market length is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. We are comfortable maintaining a more open position, given our balance sheet.
Slide 14 shows our O&M and capital outlook at Generation. Our O&M forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the Everett Marine Terminal that serves our Mystic needs. Like others, the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns, resulting in increased cost going forward. In total, these updates have added $75 million in O&M cost or about a 6% -- or $0.06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021. However, even with these cost pressures, we expect to see a 1% annual decline in O&M over the next 4 years. 
Compared to our previous disclosure, our 2019 to 2021 CapEx is up modestly: in 2019, due to timing delays for our Medway plant and some retail customer-sited solar; in 2020, with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices, where we had hedged with collars. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Slide 15 rolls forward ExGen's available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022. We expect cumulative available cash flow to be $7.8 billion, which is $200 million higher than our previous 4-year outlook. We will use the available cash flow from ExGen to primarily fund the increased utility investment, pay down debt and cover a small portion of the dividend. We will invest approximately $600 million in growth capital, which is primarily customer-sited solar projects at Constellation and as I mentioned, the completion of the West Medway plant in New England this quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities. As a result, we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities for ExGen by $700 million to a range of $4 billion to $4.4 billion. We will use between $300 million and $500 million of ExGen's free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities. As the utilities continue to grow, ExGen's portion of the dividend decreases even as the dividend itself grows. 
Finally, we have planned to retire between $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of debt. With our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets, we felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reductions to instead support the higher value-added and needed investments at our utilities. A big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity markets. This remains a differentiated advantage to our peers. 
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. We're comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for FFO to debt and well above the agency downgrade thresholds. As you are aware, Exelon and its operating companies are on CreditWatch Positive at both S&P and Fitch. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x in 2019. We expect to be at 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
We are actively following the PG&E bankruptcy process. PG&E is the sole offtaker of our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch or AVSR facilities, which was funded by Exelon's DOE loans and project financing that are nonrecourse to Exelon. We, along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with PG&E, recently received a FERC order affirming the commission's role to approve any modifications to existing PPAs, which PG&E has challenged in the bankruptcy court. We will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of AVSR and the role of assets like ours like have in California's clean energy future. From an earnings perspective, AVSR provides $0.03 per share to Exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics, given the nonrecourse project financing. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deployed capital for the benefit of our consumers, last year's completed rate case and improvements in PHI's ROEs. The decline in Generation earnings is a combination of normalized Illinois ZEC revenues as we recognized $0.11 of 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices, which are partially offset by increased ZEC revenues in New Jersey and New York as well as fewer planned nuclear outages. 
As you think about our 2019 earnings, the most notable new updates include: the $0.05 per share increase to our Utility earnings stance; the $0.02 to $0.03 of pension expense at ExGen due to worse-than-expected planned performance in 2018; as well as a roughly $0.03 per share drag from the recent Everett LNG facility acquisition, which represents a negative near-term impact but is a positive value driver in the future with the Mystic cost-of-service contract beginning in 2022. These impacts are reflected in our O&M and other expense data in the appendix. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 61. 
I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments."

Turning to Slide 18. I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our Generation fleet safely and reliably. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $5.3 billion of capital to benefit our customers. And we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9% to 10% earned ROEs across Exelon utility families by year-end. Building upon successes in Delaware, D.C., Maryland and Pennsylvania, we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and/or commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers. 
At Generation, a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that failed to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits. As you know, we plan to retire TMI later this year. And as a reminder, all of the Dresden and portions of the Braidwood and Byron plants did not clear last year's PJM auction. We will continue to engage with stakeholders on state policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level. 
We will support PJM price formation, changes like Fast Start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected FERC order on PJM capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for a zero-emitting nuclear plants. We'll continue to grow our dividend at 5% annually through 2020. And we'll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve. Being a good corporate citizen for our customers, communities and employees is key to who we are. 
Finally, turning to Slide 19. I will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders. We have updated some of the numbers, but the proposal -- proposition remains the same. We'll continue to focus on growing our utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022, rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory. We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize value our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it make sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Gen to Load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics and we'll grow the dividend annually at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpins this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. We are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside, though neither policy or market reforms are required. We are very confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at Exelon. 
With that, operator, we can now open the call up to questions. Thank you."

I'll start with your first question. We -- when we put our capital plans together, our LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M.

We -- when we put our capital plans together, our LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M. And if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it's about 0.3% increase over that 4-year period. And we always look at affordability. And we've got 8 bills on the distribution rate side. And 4 of them -- 3 of them are roughly flat over that period that we've showed you, 4 of them are trending less than inflation and 1 of them will come in right at inflation. And that's a combination of managing our O&M and also our energy efficiency programs, which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here. So that's basically what we're looking at in terms of affordability. The other question that we ask ourselves is are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates? And so we've been looking hard at the low-income side. And a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low-income programs along with it. So that's what we're looking at in terms of affordability bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income. 
In terms of looking forward, we think about investment in really 3 buckets. One is reliability and resiliency, just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems, the safety of our systems. And as the economy changes and we've got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system, how do you ensure that, that's reliable and resilient. The second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation. We've got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we'll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile. So thinking about sensors on the system, artificial intelligence, distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to 6 to 8 cycles, that sort of thing. And then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system in expectation of that kind of shift. So those are the areas that we think about and look out. We watch our stakeholders very closely. We're starting to see legislation and policy come out of D.C. in December, a big piece of policy there. Pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in January. And so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they're directing us."

Joe, I know that we're focused on the strong '18 performance and the '19 outlook. But I think it's sort of déjà vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout of sort of the guidance pieces for ExGen. And once again, we see, as we have in prior years, pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of play is for the earnings outlook for ExGen. Based on the algebra you gave in the deck, $0.20 headwind on total gross margin, probably a $0.05 to offset improved O&M but still much likely seen in past updates that are sort of 2 years forward that looked like today, significant pressures on ExGen margin. What can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think we roll into real time over the next 2 years?"

The first thing is we're not in the business of giving EPS guidance beyond the prompt year. But having said that, I think as you've seen through time, our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period. When you look at the gross margin in '21 versus '20, there's -- the 2 big drivers very simply are, as you mentioned, one is the backwardated  price curve. And obviously, for us the biggest impact is at NiHub and West Hub. And Jim could talk for a while about what we're doing. We're aggressively managing our portfolio. You see that we're behind our ratable plan. Actual spot prices last year obviously were very, very strong. 
And then secondly, Kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as PJM and others. And so I don't think the story has been fully written there. And obviously, we have a very large open position. The second piece of it is driven really by capacity. And some of it is in New England, where the prices were lower year-over-year, and in PJM, where we had lower volumes cleared year-over-year. But from my lens, I think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility. And hedging is -- less hedging is an example of that. And through time, we've continued to improve our earnings and we'll continue to work hard to do that in '21."

One of the things that we've done in the last year is we've gone through and accelerated our gas main replacement programs. We've moved them from 30 years to 20 years. And so you're seeing an acceleration of the gas investments. So that's one of the pieces that you're seeing trending there. One of the things that we're doing at PECO now is we're looking at some material conditions upgrades. But we are also doing a program to upgrade 4 kV feeders to 12 kV feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system. You just can't put that stuff on the kind of some of the feeders we've got in place right now. So that's one of the areas we're looking at. 
Another program at PECO is really enhancing the underground replacement program, again underground cable program against a material condition where, I think, you're pretty familiar with most of the PHI work. We've got DC PLUG that we're getting started. And we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in December. At BGE, we've got some new EV investment that's coming through after the order that just came out of the commission, so some additional capital investment there. At ComEd, we're expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place. We're doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments. We've got about a program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that's about $900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our IT systems to get ready for again more flexible, dynamic grid. So those are, I think, some of the things that you're looking at that's driving that capital trend."

The way we're looking at it right now is even before the ORDC change, we've been talking about the tighter reserve margins. And you've seen the CDR reports. And we're in agreement with where they're coming in now that the reserve margins for this upcoming summer look like they are somewhere between 7% and 8%. So I think with the ORDC changes, you're just making that likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role in where the summer prices go. We've seen the forward market move up since the end of Q3 about $15 for summer on peak. Over the last month over so, it's been more up and down and maybe a little higher but more flattish. 
So I think the market has been moving around. It's x base station of just how many scarcity hours there's going to be, which to your point is the hard thing to predict. Obviously, it depends on whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outages or variable win. The one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at $9,000 is $1 on the Cal ATC price. It's about $13 or $14 on the summer on peak price. So I think what we're going to see the market do is really trade in a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer $15 at a time just by adding an hour or 2. So to put an estimate on it right now is really to say how many hours we think there's going to be. But I think the way we like to think about is it's increased the likelihood and sends the right price signal in times of tight market conditions."

Thank you for joining us for our year-end 2018 call. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees and those of other utilities, who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent polar vortex. Our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100% during the week. The investment on reliability made on our system made a difference, and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached to negative 23 degrees without including the windchill factor. 
I'll start on Slide 5. 2018 was a great year for Exelon and its operating companies. We executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers, communities and shareholders. We are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019. Our financial performance was strong. Full year GAAP earnings were $2.07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were $3.12 per share, well ahead of the original guidance range. Joe will walk through the details later in the call. 
Last year, we shared our goals for 2018, and I'm proud to report we were able to meet those commitments. Utility and Generation operations had best performance in multiple categories. I'll get to those details in a few minutes. Last year, Exelon Utilities invested more than $5.5 billion in capital primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience as well as improved reliability and resiliency, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We were also effective on the regulatory front, completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018. PHI was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases, including Pepco in Maryland and D.C. for the first time since 1980s. We shared the benefit of a tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than $675 million on an annual basis. Working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continued to improve customer service. 
On the policy front, the Second and Seventh Circuit Court upheld the ZEC program in New York and Illinois. Although the plaintiffs have appealed to the Supreme Court, we expect these rulings to stand. New Jersey enacted the ZEC legislation, which will start this spring. And we're still focused on preserving nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. 
The Public Utility Commission of Texas adopted the changes to the ORDC curve earlier this year. We are awaiting a decision from FERC on PJM's Fast Start proposal and on PJM's capacity market reform. And PJM is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months. These policies, each in their own way, better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet with the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets. 
We are growing our dividend by 5% each year through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to $1.45 per share on Monday. We're dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve and an important part of who we are and what we do.  
As part of our partnership with the UN HeForShe initiative, we held an inaugural STEM initiative leadership academies for teenagers in Chicago and Washington, D.C. 95 girls participated in a week-long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about STEM. We're expanding this program in 2019. And 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions. Our employees volunteered more than 240,000 hours last year, on average, 7 hours per employee and donated nearly $13 million. In addition, Exelon donated more than $51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint. 
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34,000 employees. We were named a Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Black Enterprise magazine, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. We were also recognized for our environmental stewardship. We received a score of A- on both the CDP climate change and water surveys, the highest by any utility for each. We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th year in a row. And we had a series of commitments for the 2018 we delivered on. The task is for 2019 is beginning as big. And I will cover those at the end of the call.
On Slide 6, we show the impact that Exelon management model has had on our Utility operations. Each of our utilities have materially improved their operations since the merger with Constellation or PHI. To put this chart in perspective, ComEd has improved its overall reliability 60% since 2012. The hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off. In 2018, all 4 of our utilities ended up in top quartile for safety or outage frequency performance with ComEd at top decile and PHI matching its best performance on record. Each utility achieved top quartile on CAIDI or outage duration, except PECO, which missed top quartile by only 1 minute. 
BGE and ComEd performed in top decile. BGE and PECO had top decile performance in gas odor response for the sixth consecutive year and PHI delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row. This level of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers. But we still have more to do to confront climate change and our customer demands. Customer satisfaction was top quartile at, at least 3 of the 4 utilities. ComEd, BGE and PHI had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction. ComEd and PHI scored in top decile for service level and BGE and PHI had their best performance on record. 
Our utilities in the Mid-Atlantic operated extremely well in the face of record-breaking rainfall. D.C. saw more than 5.5 feet of rain, Baltimore 6 feet and Philadelphia 8 feet of rain during last year. Our safety metrics improved over the year as result of the actions we're taking to correct course. We will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area. 
Turning to our competitive business on Slide 7. Our Generation fleet performed very well in 2018, providing abundance of clean electricity that our country needs. In fact, Exelon generated 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States, more than twice as many any other generator. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 94.6%, exceeding 94% for the third year in a row in 5 out of the last 6 years. We generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours, avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Our average outage duration was 21 days, a new Exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average. 
Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 98.1% and wind and solar captured 96.1% were better than planned. In October, we acquired the Everett LNG import facility. And in December, we received a cost-of-service order from FERC for Mystic Unit 8 and 9, which together will allow us to provide fuel security in New England market through May of 2024. Our Mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in January and February of last year. 
At Constellation, our C&I operating metrics remained strong: 78% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 24 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continue to focus on cost is helping us support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers. That relationship is more than just power and gas but is built on Constellation's unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. 
Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a",1981,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance. 
Starting with Slide #8. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 above our original midpoint. 
Exelon Utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues, with the early resolution of rate cases at Pepco and favorable weather. This was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms. ExGen performed in line with guidance. Realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018, including higher allocated transmission costs. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Turning to Slide 9. It shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes. Across our utilities, we received final orders in 8 distribution cases. We reached settlements in 6 of the cases at PECO; Delmarva Delaware on the electric and gas sides; Delmarva Maryland; and Pepco Maryland and D.C., which is the first time we've had settlements at Pepco since the 1980s. Additionally, ComEd received 100% of its ask for the second year in a row. And finally in early January, the Maryland PSC approved 70% of the ask in BGE's gas distribution case. Our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we compare the 2018 trailing 12-month blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs to 2017. Our constructive rate case results and the roll-off of the FAS 109 charge drove the improved earned returns this year. We are encouraged by PHI's ongoing improvement with earned ROEs improving by 70 to 140 basis points. Exelon Utilities earned a combined 9.7% ROE, up year-over-year. We remain focused on achieving our Utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. We expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9% to 10% range in 2019.
On Slide 11, we roll forward our outlook for Utility CapEx and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022. Since the merger with PHI in 2016, we have invested more than $16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly $23 billion over the next 4 years. As Chris said, these investments are improving our system reliability, service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future. 
As a reminder, the CapEx budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we generally find more investment due to additional system needs. When we compare our 2019 to 2021 CapEx outlook versus the same period last year, we plan to invest an additional $1.5 billion of CapEx for the benefit of our customers. This additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility, ComEd. 
Since the PHI merger, we have added nearly $6 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.8% annually to $50.7 billion, adding $13.1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. Rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7.4% growth we projected last year.  
As a reminder, the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. These support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 22. 
As you turn to Slide 12, we continue to forecast strong Utility less holding company EPS growth of 6% to 8%, even for the elevated -- even from the elevated 2018 starting point, where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range -- we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 per share. Compared to last year, the outlook for 2019 to '21 has improved with all bands increasing by $0.05 per share. The durability of our industry-leading earnings growth reflect a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for more digital economy and growing environmental goals, along with concerted efforts to manage cost and a focus on modest customer bill inflation.
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. There is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure. Open Gross Margin increased $50 million due to improving spark spreads at ERCOT as well as higher prices at New York Zone A and NiHub, which were offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in power new business. In 2020, Open Gross Margin is up $150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions. Given our hedged position and execution of a $100 million of new business, total gross margin increased by $50 million since last quarter. 
We are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down $250 million compared to 2020. The decline reflects lower power crisis in PJM and ERCOT plus lower capacity revenues in New England and PJM. Our power and non-power new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with the prior years. I should point out that these disclosures are based on 12/31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ORDC curve changes in Texas. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 while we're $0.02 to $0.05 -- 2% to 5% behind ratable in 2021, when considering cross-commodity hedges. Our open market length is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. We are comfortable maintaining a more open position, given our balance sheet.
Slide 14 shows our O&M and capital outlook at Generation. Our O&M forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the Everett Marine Terminal that serves our Mystic needs. Like others, the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns, resulting in increased cost going forward. In total, these updates have added $75 million in O&M cost or about a 6% -- or $0.06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021. However, even with these cost pressures, we expect to see a 1% annual decline in O&M over the next 4 years. 
Compared to our previous disclosure, our 2019 to 2021 CapEx is up modestly: in 2019, due to timing delays for our Medway plant and some retail customer-sited solar; in 2020, with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices, where we had hedged with collars. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Slide 15 rolls forward ExGen's available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022. We expect cumulative available cash flow to be $7.8 billion, which is $200 million higher than our previous 4-year outlook. We will use the available cash flow from ExGen to primarily fund the increased utility investment, pay down debt and cover a small portion of the dividend. We will invest approximately $600 million in growth capital, which is primarily customer-sited solar projects at Constellation and as I mentioned, the completion of the West Medway plant in New England this quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities. As a result, we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities for ExGen by $700 million to a range of $4 billion to $4.4 billion. We will use between $300 million and $500 million of ExGen's free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities. As the utilities continue to grow, ExGen's portion of the dividend decreases even as the dividend itself grows. 
Finally, we have planned to retire between $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of debt. With our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets, we felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reductions to instead support the higher value-added and needed investments at our utilities. A big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity markets. This remains a differentiated advantage to our peers. 
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. We're comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for FFO to debt and well above the agency downgrade thresholds. As you are aware, Exelon and its operating companies are on CreditWatch Positive at both S&P and Fitch. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x in 2019. We expect to be at 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
We are actively following the PG&E bankruptcy process. PG&E is the sole offtaker of our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch or AVSR facilities, which was funded by Exelon's DOE loans and project financing that are nonrecourse to Exelon. We, along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with PG&E, recently received a FERC order affirming the commission's role to approve any modifications to existing PPAs, which PG&E has challenged in the bankruptcy court. We will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of AVSR and the role that assets like ours have in California's clean energy future. From an earnings perspective, AVSR provides $0.03 per share to Exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics, given the nonrecourse project financing. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deployed capital for the benefit of our consumers, last year's completed rate case and improvements in PHI's ROEs. The decline in Generation earnings is a combination of normalized Illinois ZEC revenues as we recognized $0.11 of 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices, which are partially offset by increased ZEC revenues in New Jersey and New York as well as fewer planned nuclear outages. 
As you think about our 2019 earnings, the most notable new updates include: the $0.05 per share increase to our Utility earnings stance; the $0.02 to $0.03 of pension expense at ExGen due to worse-than-expected planned performance in 2018; as well as a roughly $0.03 per share drag from the recent Everett LNG facility acquisition, which represents a negative near-term impact but is a positive value driver in the future with the Mystic cost-of-service contract beginning in 2022. These impacts are reflected in our O&M and other expense data in the appendix. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 61. 
I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments."

Turning to Slide 18. I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our Generation fleet safely and reliably. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $5.3 billion of capital to benefit our customers. And we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9% to 10% earned ROEs across Exelon utility families by year-end. Building upon successes in Delaware, D.C., Maryland and Pennsylvania, we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and/or commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers. 
At Generation, a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that failed to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits. As you know, we plan to retire TMI later this year. And as a reminder, all of the Dresden and portions of the Braidwood and Byron plants did not clear last year's PJM auction. We will continue to engage with stakeholders on state policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level. 
We will support PJM price formation, changes like Fast Start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected FERC order on PJM capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for zero-emitting nuclear plants. We'll continue to grow our dividend at 5% annually through 2020. And we'll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve. Being a good corporate citizen for our customers, communities and employees is key to who we are. 
Finally, turning to Slide 19. I will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders. We have updated some of the numbers, but the proposal -- proposition remains the same. We'll continue to focus on growing our utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022, rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory. We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it make sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Gen to Load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics and we'll grow the dividend annually at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpins this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. We are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside, though neither policy or market reforms are required. We are very confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at Exelon. 
With that, operator, we can now open the call up to questions. Thank you."

I'll start with your first question. We -- when we put our capital plans together, our LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M. And if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it'",476,"Greg, it's Anne Pramaggiore. I'll start with your first question. We -- when we put our capital plans together, our LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M. And if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it's about 0.3% increase over that 4-year period. And we always look at affordability. And we've got 8 bills on the distribution rate side. And 4 of them -- 3 of them are roughly flat over that period that we've showed you, 4 of them are trending less than inflation and 1 of them will come in right at inflation. And that's a combination of managing our O&M and also our energy efficiency programs, which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here. So that's basically what we're looking at in terms of affordability. The other question that we ask ourselves is are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates? And so we've been looking hard at the low-income side. And a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low-income programs along with it. So that's what we're looking at in terms of affordability, bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income. 
In terms of looking forward, we think about investment in really 3 buckets. One is reliability and resiliency, just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems, the safety of our systems. And as the economy changes and we've got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system, how do you ensure that, that's reliable and resilient. The second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation. We've got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we'll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile. So thinking about sensors on the system, artificial intelligence, distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to 6 to 8 cycles, that sort of thing. And then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system in expectation of that kind of shift. So those are the areas that we think about and look at. We watch our stakeholders very closely. We're starting to see legislation and policy come out of D.C. in December, a big piece of policy there. Pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in January. And so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they're directing us."

But I think it's sort of déjà vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout of sort of the guidance pieces for ExGen. And once again we see, as we have in prior years, pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of play is for the earnings outlook for ExGen. Based on the algebra you gave in the deck, $0.20 headwind on total gross margin, probably a $0.05 to offset improved O&M but still much like we've seen in past updates that are sort of 2 years forward, there looked like, today, significant pressures on ExGen margin. What can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think we roll into real time over the next 2 years?"

The first thing is we're not in the business of giving EPS guidance beyond the prompt year. But having said that, I think as you've seen through time, our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period. When you look at the gross margin in '21 versus '20, there's -- the 2 big drivers very simply are, as you mentioned, one is the backwardated  price curve. And obviously, for us the biggest impact is at NiHub and West Hub. And Jim could talk for a while about what we're doing. We're aggressively managing our portfolio. You see that we're behind our ratable plan. Actual spot prices last year obviously were very, very strong. 
And then secondly, Kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as PJM and others. And so I don't think the story has been fully written there. And obviously, we have a very large open position. The second piece of it is driven really by capacity. And some of it is in New England, where the prices were lower year-over-year, and in PJM, where we had lower volumes cleared year-over-year. But from my lens, I think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility. And hedging is -- less hedging is an example of that. And through time, we've continued to improve our earnings and we'll continue to work hard to do that in '21."

Until we get these market reforms in, if it's moving the plants in Illinois or some amount of plants in Illinois to FRR, so we can get better capacity treatment that matches the state's environmental needs, or if you look at priced formation that's working through, you look at reserve curves being revised, there's a lot of activity going. So that's why we're keeping more of an open position. We believe the market will strengthen."

Let me start by giving you a sense of what the investment patterns look like and what's sort of, I think, driving the trending that you're seeing. And then between Joe and I, we'll talk about the ROEs. So there's a couple of things that are happening there. One of the things that we've done in the last year is we've gone through and accelerated our gas main replacement programs. We've moved them from 30 years to 20 years. And so you're seeing an acceleration of the gas investments. So that's one of the pieces that you're seeing trending there. One of the things that we're doing at PECO now is we're looking at some material condition upgrades. But we are also doing a program to upgrade 4 kV feeders to 12 kV feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system. You just can't put that stuff on the kind of some of the feeders we've got in place right now. So that's one of the areas we're looking at. 
Another program at PECO is really enhancing the underground replacement program again -- underground cable program against a material condition where, I think, you're pretty familiar with most of the PHI work. We've got DC PLUG that we're getting started. And we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in December. At BGE, we've got some new EV investment that's coming through after the order that just came out of the commission, so some additional capital investment there. At ComEd, we're expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place. We're doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments. We've got about -- a program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that's about $900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our IT systems to get ready for again more flexible, dynamic grid. So those are, I think, some of the things that you're looking at that's driving that capital trend."

We committed -- we had a capacity commitment prior to the last auction. And we were committed to honoring that commitment. And one way to do that was to acquire the facility.

The way we're looking at it right now is even before the ORDC change, we've been talking about the tighter reserve margins. And you've seen the CDR reports. And we're in agreement with where they're coming in now that the reserve margins for this upcoming summer look like they are somewhere between 7% and 8%. So I think with the ORDC changes, you're just making that likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role in where the summer prices go. We've seen the forward market move up since the end of Q3 about $15 for summer on peak. Over the last month over so, it's been more up and down and maybe a little higher but more flattish. 
So I think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there's going to be, which to your point is a hard thing to predict. Obviously, it depends on whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outages or variable wind. The one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at $9,000 is $1 on the Cal ATC price. It's about $13 or $14 on the summer on peak price. So I think what we're going to see the market do is really trade in a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer $15 at a time just by adding an hour or 2. So to put an estimate on it right now is really to say how many hours we think there's going to be. But I think the way we like to think about is it's increased the likelihood and sends the right price signal in times of tight market conditions."

Thank you for joining us for our year-end 2018 call. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees and those of other utilities, who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent polar vortex. Our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100% during the week. The investment on reliability made on our system made a difference, and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached to negative 23 degrees without including the windchill factor. 
I'll start on Slide 5. 2018 was a great year for Exelon and its operating companies. We executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers, communities and shareholders. We are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019. Our financial performance was strong. Full year GAAP earnings were $2.07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were $3.12 per share, well ahead of the original guidance range. Joe will walk through the details later in the call. 
Last year, we shared our goals for 2018, and I'm proud to report we were able to meet those commitments. Utility and Generation operations had best performance in multiple categories. I'll get to those details in a few minutes. Last year, Exelon Utilities invested more than $5.5 billion in capital primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience as well as improved reliability and resiliency, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We were also effective on the regulatory front, completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018. PHI was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases, including Pepco in Maryland and D.C. for the first time since 1980s. We shared the benefit of a tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than $675 million on an annual basis. Working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continued to improve customer service. 
On the policy front, the Second and Seventh Circuit Court upheld the ZEC program in New York and Illinois. Although the plaintiffs have appealed to the Supreme Court, we expect these rulings to stand. New Jersey enacted the ZEC legislation, which will start this spring. And we're still focused on preserving nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. 
The Public Utility Commission of Texas adopted the changes to the ORDC curve earlier this year. We are awaiting a decision from FERC on PJM's Fast Start proposal and on PJM's capacity market reform. And PJM is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months. These policies, each in their own way, better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet with the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets. 
We are growing our dividend by 5% each year through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to $1.45 per share on Monday. We're dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve and an important part of who we are and what we do.  
As part of our partnership with the UN HeForShe initiative, we held an inaugural STEM initiative leadership academies for teenagers in Chicago and Washington, D.C. 95 girls participated in a week-long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about STEM. We're expanding this program in 2019. And 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions. Our employees volunteered more than 240,000 hours last year, on average, 7 hours per employee and donated nearly $13 million. In addition, Exelon donated more than $51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint. 
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34,000 employees. We were named a Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Black Enterprise magazine, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. We were also recognized for our environmental stewardship. We received a score of A- on both the CDP climate change and water surveys, the highest by any utility for each. We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th year in a row. And we had a series of commitments for the 2018 we delivered on. The task is for 2019 is beginning as big. And I will cover those at the end of the call.
On Slide 6, we show the impact that Exelon management model has had on our Utility operations. Each of our utilities have materially improved their operations since the merger with Constellation or PHI. To put this chart in perspective, ComEd has improved its overall reliability 60% since 2012. The hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off. In 2018, all 4 of our utilities ended up in top quartile for safety or outage frequency performance with ComEd at top decile and PHI matching its best performance on record. Each utility achieved top quartile on CAIDI or outage duration, except PECO, which missed top quartile by only 1 minute. 
BGE and ComEd performed in top decile. BGE and PECO had top decile performance in gas odor response for the sixth consecutive year and PHI delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row. This level of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers. But we still have more to do to confront climate change and our customer demands. Customer satisfaction was top quartile at, at least 3 of the 4 utilities. ComEd, BGE and PHI had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction. ComEd and PHI scored in top decile for service level and BGE and PHI had their best performance on record. 
Our utilities in the Mid-Atlantic operated extremely well in the face of record-breaking rainfall. D.C. saw more than 5.5 feet of rain, Baltimore 6 feet and Philadelphia 8 feet of rain during last year. Our safety metrics improved over the year as result of the actions we're taking to correct course. We will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area. 
Turning to our competitive business on Slide 7. Our Generation fleet performed very well in 2018, providing abundance of clean electricity that our country needs. In fact, Exelon generated 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States, more than twice as many any other generator. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 94.6%, exceeding 94% for the third year in a row in 5 out of the last 6 years. We generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours, avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Our average outage duration was 21 days, a new Exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average. 
Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 98.1% and wind and solar captured 96.1% were better than planned. In October, we acquired the Everett LNG import facility. And in December, we received a cost-of-service order from FERC for Mystic Unit 8 and 9, which together will allow us to provide fuel security in New England market through May of 2024. Our Mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in January and February of last year. 
At Constellation, our C&I operating metrics remained strong: 78% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 24 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continue to focus on cost is helping us support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers. That relationship is more than just power and gas but is built on Constellation's unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. 
Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance. Starting with Slide #8. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a",1981,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance. 
Starting with Slide #8. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 above our original midpoint. 
Exelon Utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues, with the early resolution of rate cases at Pepco and favorable weather. This was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms. ExGen performed in line with guidance. Realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018, including higher allocated transmission costs. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Turning to Slide 9. It shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes. Across our utilities, we received final orders in 8 distribution cases. We reached settlements in 6 of the cases at PECO; Delmarva Delaware on the electric and gas sides; Delmarva Maryland; and Pepco Maryland and D.C., which is the first time we've had settlements at Pepco since the 1980s. Additionally, ComEd received 100% of its ask for the second year in a row. And finally in early January, the Maryland PSC approved 70% of the ask in BGE's gas distribution case. Our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions.
On Slide 10, we compare the 2018 trailing 12-month blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs to 2017. Our constructive rate case results and the roll-off of the FAS 109 charge drove the improved earned returns this year. We are encouraged by PHI's ongoing improvement with earned ROEs improving by 70 to 140 basis points. Exelon Utilities earned a combined 9.7% ROE, up year-over-year. We remain focused on achieving our Utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. We expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9% to 10% range in 2019.
On Slide 11, we roll forward our outlook for Utility CapEx and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022. Since the merger with PHI in 2016, we have invested more than $16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly $23 billion over the next 4 years. As Chris said, these investments are improving our system reliability, service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future. 
As a reminder, the CapEx budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we generally find more investment due to additional system needs. When we compare our 2019 to 2021 CapEx outlook versus the same period last year, we plan to invest an additional $1.5 billion of CapEx for the benefit of our customers. This additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility, ComEd. 
Since the PHI merger, we have added nearly $6 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.8% annually to $50.7 billion, adding $13.1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. Rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7.4% growth we projected last year.  
As a reminder, the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. These support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 22. 
As you turn to Slide 12, we continue to forecast strong Utility less holding company EPS growth of 6% to 8%, even for the elevated -- even from the elevated 2018 starting point, where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range -- we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 per share. Compared to last year, the outlook for 2019 to '21 has improved with all bands increasing by $0.05 per share. The durability of our industry-leading earnings growth reflect a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for more digital economy and growing environmental goals, along with concerted efforts to manage cost and a focus on modest customer bill inflation.
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. There is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure. Open Gross Margin increased $50 million due to improving spark spreads at ERCOT as well as higher prices at New York Zone A and NiHub, which were offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in power new business. In 2020, Open Gross Margin is up $150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions. Given our hedged position and execution of a $100 million of new business, total gross margin increased by $50 million since last quarter. 
We are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down $250 million compared to 2020. The decline reflects lower power crisis in PJM and ERCOT plus lower capacity revenues in New England and PJM. Our power and non-power new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with the prior years. I should point out that these disclosures are based on 12/31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ORDC curve changes in Texas. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 while we're $0.02 to $0.05 -- 2% to 5% behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross-commodity hedges. Our open market length is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. We are comfortable maintaining a more open position, given our balance sheet.
Slide 14 shows our O&M and capital outlook at Generation. Our O&M forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the Everett Marine Terminal that serves our Mystic needs. Like others, the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns, resulting in increased cost going forward. In total, these updates have added $75 million in O&M cost or about a 6% -- or $0.06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021. However, even with these cost pressures, we expect to see a 1% annual decline in O&M over the next 4 years. 
Compared to our previous disclosure, our 2019 to 2021 CapEx is up modestly: in 2019, due to timing delays for our Medway plant and some retail customer-sited solar; in 2020, with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices, where we had hedged with collars. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Slide 15 rolls forward ExGen's available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022. We expect cumulative available cash flow to be $7.8 billion, which is $200 million higher than our previous 4-year outlook. We will use the available cash flow from ExGen to primarily fund the increased utility investment, pay down debt and cover a small portion of the dividend. We will invest approximately $600 million in growth capital, which is primarily customer-sited solar projects at Constellation and as I mentioned, the completion of the West Medway plant in New England this quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities. As a result, we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities for ExGen by $700 million to a range of $4 billion to $4.4 billion. We will use between $300 million and $500 million of ExGen's free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities. As the utilities continue to grow, ExGen's portion of the dividend decreases even as the dividend itself grows. 
Finally, we have planned to retire between $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of debt. With our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets, we felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reductions to instead support the higher value-added and needed investments at our utilities. A big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity markets. This remains a differentiated advantage to our peers. 
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. We're comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for FFO to debt and well above the agency downgrade thresholds. As you are aware, Exelon and its operating companies are on CreditWatch Positive at both S&P and Fitch. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x in 2019. We expect to be at 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
We are actively following the PG&E bankruptcy process. PG&E is the sole offtaker of our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch or AVSR facilities, which was funded by Exelon's DOE loans and project financing that are nonrecourse to Exelon. We, along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with PG&E, recently received a FERC order affirming the commission's role to approve any modifications to existing PPAs, which PG&E has challenged in the bankruptcy court. We will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of AVSR and the role that assets like ours have in California's clean energy future. From an earnings perspective, AVSR provides $0.03 per share to Exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics, given the nonrecourse project financing. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deployed capital for the benefit of our consumers, last year's completed rate case and improvements in PHI's ROEs. The decline in Generation earnings is a combination of normalized Illinois ZEC revenues as we recognized $0.11 of 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices, which are partially offset by increased ZEC revenues in New Jersey and New York as well as fewer planned nuclear outages. 
As you think about our 2019 earnings, the most notable new updates include: the $0.05 per share increase to our Utility earnings stance; the $0.02 to $0.03 of pension expense at ExGen due to worse-than-expected planned performance in 2018; as well as a roughly $0.03 per share drag from the recent Everett LNG facility acquisition, which represents a negative near-term impact but is a positive value driver in the future with the Mystic cost-of-service contract beginning in 2022. These impacts are reflected in our O&M and other expense data in the appendix. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 61. 
I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments."

Turning to Slide 18. I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our Generation fleet safely and reliably. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $5.3 billion of capital to benefit our customers. And we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9% to 10% earned ROEs across Exelon utility families by year-end. Building upon successes in Delaware, D.C., Maryland and Pennsylvania, we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and/or commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers. 
At Generation, a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that failed to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits. As you know, we plan to retire TMI later this year. And as a reminder, all of the Dresden and portions of the Braidwood and Byron plants did not clear last year's PJM auction. We will continue to engage with stakeholders on state policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level. 
We will support PJM price formation, changes like Fast Start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected FERC order on PJM capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for zero-emitting nuclear plants. We'll continue to grow our dividend at 5% annually through 2020. And we'll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve. Being a good corporate citizen for our customers, communities and employees is key to who we are. 
Finally, turning to Slide 19. I will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders. We have updated some of the numbers, but the proposal -- proposition remains the same. We'll continue to focus on growing our utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022, rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory. We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it make sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Gen to Load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics and we'll grow the dividend annually at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpins this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. We are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside, though neither policy or market reforms are required. We are very confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at Exelon. 
With that, operator, we can now open the call up to questions. Thank you."

I'll start with your first question. We -- when we put our capital plans together, our LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M. And if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it'",476,"Greg, it's Anne Pramaggiore. I'll start with your first question. We -- when we put our capital plans together, our LRPs each year, we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M. And if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it's about 0.3% increase over that 4-year period. And we always look at affordability. And we've got 8 bills on the distribution rate side. And 4 of them -- 3 of them are roughly flat over that period that we've showed you, 4 of them are trending less than inflation and 1 of them will come in right at inflation. And that's a combination of managing our O&M and also our energy efficiency programs, which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here. So that's basically what we're looking at in terms of affordability. The other question that we ask ourselves is are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates? And so we've been looking hard at the low-income side. And a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low-income programs along with it. So that's what we're looking at in terms of affordability, bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income. 
In terms of looking forward, we think about investment in really 3 buckets. One is reliability and resiliency, just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems, the safety of our systems. And as the economy changes and we've got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system, how do you ensure that, that's reliable and resilient. The second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation. We've got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we'll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile. So thinking about sensors on the system, artificial intelligence, distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to 6 to 8 cycles, that sort of thing. And then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system in expectation of that kind of shift. So those are the areas that we think about and look at. We watch our stakeholders very closely. We're starting to see legislation and policy come out of D.C. in December, a big piece of policy there. Pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in January. And so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they're directing us."

Joe, I know that you were focused on the strong '18 performance and the '19 outlook. But I think it's sort of déjà vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout of sort of the guidance pieces for ExGen. And once again we see, as we have in prior years, pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of play is for the earnings outlook for ExGen. Based on the algebra you gave in the deck, $0.20 headwind on total gross margin, probably a $0.05 to offset improved O&M but still much like we've seen in past updates that are sort of 2 years forward, there looked like, today, significant pressures on ExGen margin. What can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think we roll into real time over the next 2 years?"

The first thing is we're not in the business of giving EPS guidance beyond the prompt year. But having said that, I think as you've seen through time, our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period. When you look at the gross margin in '21 versus '20, there's -- the 2 big drivers very simply are, as you mentioned, one is the backwardated price curve. And obviously, for us the biggest impact is at NiHub and West Hub. And Jim could talk for a while about what we're doing. We're aggressively managing our portfolio. You see that we're behind our ratable plan. Actual spot prices last year obviously were very, very strong. 
And then secondly, Kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as PJM and others. And so I don't think the story has been fully written there. And obviously, we have a very large open position. The second piece of it is driven really by capacity. And some of it is in New England, where the prices were lower year-over-year, and in PJM, where we had lower volumes cleared year-over-year. But from my lens, I think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility. And hedging is -- less hedging is an example of that. And through time, we've continued to improve our earnings and we'll continue to work hard to do that in '21."

So that's why we're keeping more of an open position. We believe the market will strengthen."

One of the things that we've done in the last year is we've gone through and accelerated our gas main replacement programs. We've moved them from 30 years to 20 years. And so you're seeing an acceleration of the gas investments. So that's one of the pieces that you're seeing trending there. One of the things that we're doing at PECO now is we're looking at some material condition upgrades. But we are also doing a program to upgrade 4 kV feeders to 12 kV feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system. You just can't put that stuff on the kind of some of the feeders we've got in place right now. So that's one of the areas we're looking at. 
Another program at PECO is really enhancing the underground replacement program again -- underground cable program against a material condition where, I think, you're pretty familiar with most of the PHI work. We've got DC PLUG that we're getting started. And we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in December. At BGE, we've got some new EV investment that's coming through after the order that just came out of the commission, so some additional capital investment there. At ComEd, we're expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place. We're doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments. We've got about -- a program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that's about $900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our IT systems to get ready for again more flexible, dynamic grid. So those are, I think, some of the things that you're looking at that's driving that capital trend."

The way we're looking at it right now is even before the ORDC change, we've been talking about the tighter reserve margins. And you've seen the CDR reports. And we're in agreement with where they're coming in now that the reserve margins for this upcoming summer look like they are somewhere between 7% and 8%. So I think with the ORDC changes, you're just making that likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role in where the summer prices go. We've seen the forward market move up since the end of Q3 about $15 for summer on peak. Over the last month over so, it's been more up and down and maybe a little higher but more flattish. 
So I think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there's going to be, which to your point is a hard thing to predict. Obviously, it depends on whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outages or variable wind. The one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at $9,000 is $1 on the Cal ATC price. It's about $13 or $14 on the summer on peak price. So I think what we're going to see the market do is really trade in a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer $15 at a time just by adding an hour or 2. So to put an estimate on it right now is really to say how many hours we think there's going to be. But I think the way we like to think about is it's increased the likelihood and sends the right price signal in times of tight market conditions."

Second, we received credit upgrades from both S&P and Fitch. These upgrades recognize the successful execution on our utility-driven growth strategy and reduction in business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Third, we reached settlements in New Jersey on the ACE rate case and the infrastructure investment program. These outcomes reflect continued positive evolution of our partnership with regulators built on improvement and reliability and customer satisfaction. 
Finally, turning to Slide 5, in March, we celebrated the seventh anniversary of the Constellation merger and the third anniversary of the PHI merger. Each merger has positively contributed to our strategy of increasing our regulated business mix and providing more stable earnings. Before these mergers, Exelon earned a mix of 28% utilities, 72% generation. In 2021, we project that mix will have plot with about 70% earnings coming from utilities. 
Both through the Constellation merger, we grew our regulated earnings with the addition of BGE and also benefited from the combination of Exelon and Constellation's competitive business, creating an industry leader integrated business that supports efficiently hedging of our plants while capturing incremental margins and cash flows. 
The PHI merger further advanced our strategy to become more regulated while creating value for customers and communities we serve. We are meeting or exceeding all of our reliability merger customers in customer across the PHI service territory and experiencing record reliability. 
The frequency and duration of outages have improved at each utility, customers are out of power less frequency -- with less frequency and are restored to service much faster when out of power. In 2018, Delmarva customers at the lowest frequency of outages. At Pepco, customers saw the fastest restoration time. And customer satisfaction is an all-time high at ACE, Delmarva and Pepco. 
We're also delivering on our promise to be a true partner with the communities we serve. In PHI, utilities have contributed more than $470 million in total economic impact since the merger closed. In 2018 alone, these utilities spent $313 million with minority of women-owned suppliers, which is between 22% and 29% of each utility's total procurement spend. 
Each utility has made investments and workforce development programs, including partnering with the District of Colombia to create the DC Infrastructure Academy. We are also an important community partner for hundreds of organizations in the PHI service territory, contributing more than $15 million in financial support and volunteering approximately 85,000 hours since the merger was approved. 
Because of the improved service and enhanced partnership with our communities, we are building trust in our jurisdictions and are seeing a more positive regulatory empowerment develop. Since the merger, we have reached construction settlements in each of the PHI jurisdictions, including Pepco, Maryland and DC, and we've had our first settlement since 1980s. 
Exelon has delivered on the promises we've made to our customers and the communities and the shareholders when we merged with PHI in 2016. 
Turning to our financial results on Slide 6. We had a strong quarter. On a GAAP basis, we are $0.93 per share versus $0.60 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.87 per share versus $0.96 per share last year. 
Joe will cover the drivers in his remarks. Turning to Slide 7, at the utilities, we continue to execute at top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are resulting in improved reliability, which is strengthening out the relationship of our customers and the regulators. We remain focused on helping our customers and communities become more energy-efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years, and I'm happy to say once again the EPA named all 5 of our eligible companies BGE, Delmarva, PECO and Pepco as 2018 ENERGY STAR Partners of the Year. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatts hours of 0 emission electricity with a capacity factor of 97.1%. The best quarter performance in more than 10 years during the polar vortex where the temperatures was significantly below 0, our fleet brand at full power keeping families in our markets safe and warm. Exelon power and gas and Hydro dispatch match of 97.8% and wind and solar capture of 96.5%, exceeding plan. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a number of important developments. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the clean energy programs. Illinois is looking to advance its clean energy goals. Pennsylvania is considering adding nuclear to its alternative energy standard. New Jersey awarded 0 emission credits. PJM has made a scarcity filing in March with the request approval date by mid-December and FERC act on pass our energy pricing reforms. These actions recognize the importance of preserving the existing resources of carbon-free energy. 
Addressing the underlying efficiencies in the market. In Illinois, legislation was introduced that would require the Illinois Power Authority to procure clean capacity for combat customers using the fixed resource requirement mechanism that is currently in the PGM [indiscernible] In addition to supported a course of truly clean energy future, in Illinois, the legislation would also ensure the consumers pay less than they do today. 
The concept of the FRR has a wide support and has been endorsed by the Illinois the Clean Jobs Coalition and organized labor. Another piece of legislation has been introduced into Illinois to extend the formula rate -- Cmax formula rate provides tangible benefits to the customers as well as certainty we need to make investments and improved reliability and the resiliency in customer service while keeping the bill supportable in the 9 years [indiscernible] has filed a formula rate we have us for rate decreases 4 times. 
It's a busy legislator season as Governor [indiscernible] and the tackle Illinois significant budget problems. However, we are optimistic these 2 priorities can get done this year. In Pennsylvania, [indiscernible] introduced legislation that would treat nuclear equal to other [indiscernible] resources by adding to ultimate energy portfolio standard. 
Several hearings have been held in the House and Senate on the bill, but it's not clear the action will be taken in time to reverse our decision to retire TMI. We also achieved 2 important milestones for our existing ZEC programs in April. First, as mentioned, the U.S. Supreme Court time the challenges the New York and Illinois ZEC programs consistent with the resounding decision we received in the district and the circuit courts. 
Second, the New Jersey BPU awarded ZECs to all 3 New Jersey -- units in New Jersey allowing them to continue to provide 0 carbon energy to the state. We are pleased to see the state's [indiscernible] well thoughtful energy policy that reserves the rights to clean energy future. 
Finally, turning to FERC and PJM. We are pleased for acting on a Fast Start reforms that expand the price and eligibility for block-loaded resources. FERC has requested that PJM submit a compliance filing by July 31, and we expect the reforms to be implemented shortly after that. 
In addition, PJM filed a 206 petition to improve the pricing of reserves, which we have previously referred to as scarcity or ORDC reforms. These reforms, along with baseload transformation are essential to preserve an effective competitive market in PJM, and we're happy to see the progress being made to address these clear needs. 
Turning to Slide 9. Much of the policy work we've engaged in including preserving 0 carbon Generation. We have viewed as necessary to bridge a comprehensive carbon policy. In the past time, not just for the government, but for every business, most particularly energy business, along with their customers and stakeholders take action on reducing carbon emissions. For several decades, Exelon has been positioning itself for carbon constrained world and acting as a leader, advocating for carbon policy at the state and federal level. 
We have built the cleanest power generation company in the country. We have divested or retired all of our coal generation and invested in renewables and increasing our output of our nuclear footprint. As a result, Exelon has produced more clean energy than any other company in the United States by a factor of 2 and out of 9 -- every 9 clean megawatts in the U.S. comes from an Exelon plant. 
We've avoided 67.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas, equivalent of making -- taking 14.5 million cars off the road through 2 previous carbon reduction goals. And we are on track to meet the most recent goal of 15% additional reduction of emissions from internal operations. 
We are the leading voice in supporting policies and regulations that require reduced emissions and encourage technology changes. And across our businesses, we are working to enable clean energy solutions to our customers and communities. 
In 2018 alone, our energy efficiency programs save customers 21.9 million-megawatt hours of electricity, avoiding 9.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission. We're investing in electric transportation and charging infrastructure at both utilities and Constellation. 
Exelon is also involved in grand scale energy storage development to enable faster and greater reliability for the use of renewables. One example of this is through our efforts to launch the Energy, which works with the national labs and research universities to commercialize new technologies. 
There wasn't changing in terms of awareness of the scope of climate change and the need for a new potential solutions. Our customers are sitting in our communities as well as our employees are demanding clean power so that is what we intend to provide. We still have a long way to go but the engagements that we are seeing at the state level burns our view that these policies will be part of our country's future. 
With that, now I'll turn it over with Joe to continue the call."
296181,609039553,1717074,"Exelon Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial update, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financial",1310,"Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial update, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financially. We earned $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
Our performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, including a positive $0.01 of net benefit around timing and expenses. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly well within our plan due to O&M timing that commented PECO, which will reverse itself throughout the course of the year. 
Exelon Generation earned $0.30 per share, outperforming plant. This was a result of some realized gain in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and favorable timing of OEM. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. For the second quarter, we are providing adjusted operating earnings guidance from $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.87 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.09 per share lower than the first quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.10 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completed rate [indiscernible] and lower storing cost that PECO with BGE relative to the first quarter of 2018. 
Generation earnings were down $0.19 per share compared with last year. The biggest driver was the absence of $0.10 per share of ZEC catch-up payments from 2017 due to the timing of the final Illinois and Québec approvals. Generation was also impacted by lower realized power prices. 
Moving on to Slide 12. As Chris mentioned, we celebrated the third anniversary of the merger with PHI in March. We have seen tremendous improvement in PHI's operational performance, customer satisfaction and relationships with our communities and regulators, which is leading to more constructive outcomes. 
Given our progress on the commitment of our 9% to 10% ROEs across our utility and the quarterly variability individual PHI utilities depending on rate case timing, we are now consolidating the PHI utilities trailing 12 months ROEs. We have also changed the format of the slide to show the relative size of the aggregate PHI utility when compared to legacy Exelon utility and the consolidated Exelon Utilities. 
In total, the PHI utilities represent approximately 26% of our total rate base of $41.2 billion. At a consolidated basis, the PHI utilities earned a 9.3% ROE for the trailing 12 months. This is a 90-basis-point improvement over consolidated 8.4% from the fourth quarter have 2018. The improvement is due to 2018 distribution rate case settlement at both Delmarva and Pepco, favorable transmission revenue from the higher peak load and true-ups, a rolloff of higher storage cost and favorable Onan timing at Delmarva at Pepco, which will reverse over the course of the year. 
At the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs are modestly better, largely driven by the roll off of the March 2018 winter storm cost as well as new rates associated with completed rate cases that PECO and PG&E. Including PHI, the combined Exelon Utilities have a 10.2% earned ROE, which is above our 9% to 10% earned ROE target and 50 basis points higher than last quarter. 
We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth target by maintaining the earned ROE that PHI and sustaining strong performance at our utility. Turning to Slide 13, since the last call, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the Atlantic City Electric settlement agreement, which provides for a $70 million revenue increase. The new rates came into effect April 1. In addition, the BPU approved recovery of $96 million of capital over a 4-year period through the infrastructure investment program to improve reliability. 
On April 8, filed at the annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission, seeking a $6.4 million decrease to base rate, representing a fourth requested rate reduction on [indiscernible] We expect to receive the order in the fourth quarter. 
Pepco Maryland filed its latest rate case in January, requesting a $30 million revenue increase, which has been updated to $27.2 million with the test year update to actuals. The request is based on a continued infrastructure investments to enhance reliability and customer service. We expect to receive an order in the third quarter of this year. 
More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 14. During the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital across the utility and are on track to meet our $5.3 billion commitment for 2019. These investments will improve the reliability and resiliency of the grid to the benefit of our customers. 
This quarter, I would like to highlight 2 projects: the first is the modernization of Pepco's Harrison substation in Washington, D.C. This $190 million project will renovate aging infrastructure to more reliably serve important loads, including geometric stations. It also expands regional transmission capacity, supporting future load growth. 
The other project is the second phase of BG&E's large gas line replacement program in Baltimore that will be recovered through strident capital recovery method. The second phase includes $732 million of investment and will replace approximately 240 miles of gas lines by the end of 2023. 
Replacing these lines will improve the safety and reliability of the distribution system. During the first phase of the program, PG&E replaced 208 miles of gas line. Since the program started in 2014, strides has created 600 full time jobs in PG&E service territory. 
On Slide 15, we provide our gross margin update encourage hedging strategy with the Generation company. As a reminder, our disclosure previously reflected the planned retirement of PMI and include New Jersey's revenues. Since the last quarter of total gross margin was flat every year. 
In 2019, open gross margin decreased by $150 million, primarily due to lower pricing at West Hub, New York [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. 
During the quarter, we executed $150 million in powering the business. In 2020 and '21, respectively, open gross margin is up $50 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily on the back of higher prior prices at [indiscernible] and New York's which was partially offset by lower ERCOT's [indiscernible] 
Mark-to-market of hedges were down $50 million due to our hedge position offsetting the increase in gross margin and we executed $50 million of power new business on both years. Our Generation to load matching strategy continues to yield positive results. We ended the quarter 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges. 
Our open position is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are comfortable with our strategy to hold [indiscernible]. 
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. As Chris mentioned, our working [indiscernible] rewarded credit upgrade at S&P and Fitch in the first quarter. S&P upgraded Exelon issuer credit rating from BBB+ from BBB. In addition, all subsidiaries we're raised 1 notch. According to S&P, the rating upgrades reflect the successful execution of our business strategy, which has reduced business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. 
Fitch also upgraded Exelon to BBB+ based on similar reasons. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 17, we remain committed to our strategy and are pleased that our consistent execution is being recognized with by rating agencies and others. I'll close on Exelon's value proposition. We continue to grow our utilities, targeting 7.8% rate base growth and between a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. 
We continue to use free cash from the Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of our growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our emitting Generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend annually at 5% through 2020.

So there are numerous energy related bills to get to that point. Our bill for the FRR, there's one that's [ half ] to 100, and then there is one that's the clean jobs coalition. So we're in the process right now of negotiated with also bills so we can come together and provide the legislature with a coalition that agrees on many things right now. Just working through the details. We hope to be done. Meetings are constant. I've met with the leadership of both House and Senate talking about what we need to do and them showing their support for us going forward. So we're just going to keep on working on it as we always do. If it's not done in the regular session because of the other priorities, we will have a position to move through during the veto session. That's the Generation bill. The other bill in Illinois that will affect Exelon is the extension of the ComEd formula rate for 10 years. That bill is proceeding. We've been able to work with stakeholders to gain support and recognition. As I mentioned, out of the 9 passed filings that we made with the formula rate, we've had 4 rate reductions. So it's very balanced for the consumer. It's very balanced for our investment strategy, and we are able to do so in a predictable way to serve our customers. So that's Illinois.

So we can't really speculate on what would happen because we have a couple of variables that are just unknown at this time."

And as you know, the bill is not specific about the exact timetable or there -- other details that we believe are important, including how prices will be overseen by the IPA. And the reason for that is that the reason the future energy JOBS Act was so successful is it brought together a number of parties together towards a common future and what's exciting about this is that FRR concept is integral to all the other clean energy bills that are being considered right now because everyone appreciates that is that exact authority, letting that IPA conduct a clean energy capacity procurement and then having the ability to set its core towards the 0 carbon future will give it more flexibility than it has under current market rules where every asset gets the same capacity whether it's emitting or nonemitting. So we have left some room to have that discussion among stakeholders to make sure that we have the right group who are supporting it and as Chris said at the top of the call, between the clean jobs coalition, including this in their bill, the consumer Advocate fee, the tremendous benefit associated with this, we think that's the winning combination."

During the quarter, we achieved success on several key fronts and reached a couple of milestones. First, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the ZEC cases clearing the last legal challenge at the federal level for the Illinois and New York programs. The decision affirms that states have the right to protect their citizens by favoring clean energy and it is a win for the consumers, policymakers and regulators. 
Second, we received credit upgrades from both S&P and Fitch. These upgrades recognize the successful execution on our utility-driven growth strategy and reduction in business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Third, we reached settlements in New Jersey on the ACE rate case and the infrastructure investment program. These outcomes reflect the continued positive evolution of our partnership with regulators built on improvement and reliability and customer satisfaction. 
Finally, turning to Slide 5, in March, we celebrated the 7th anniversary of the Constellation merger and the 3rd anniversary of the PHI merger. Each merger has positively contributed to our strategy of increasing our regulated business mix and providing more stable earnings. Before these mergers, Exelon earned a mix of 28% utilities, 72% generation. In 2021, we project that mix will have flopped with nearly 70% earnings coming from the utilities. 
Both through the Constellation merger, we grew our regulated earnings with the addition of BGE and also benefited from the combination of Exelon and Constellation's competitive business, creating an industry leader integrated business that supports efficiently hedging of our plants while capturing incremental margins and cash flows. 
The PHI merger further advanced our strategy to become more regulated while creating value for customers and communities we serve. We are meeting or exceeding all of our reliability merger commitments in customer across the PHI service territory and experiencing record reliability. 
The frequency and duration of outages have improved at each utility, customers are out of power less frequency -- with less frequency and are restored to service much faster when out of power. In 2018, Delmarva customers had the lowest frequency of outages. At Pepco, customers saw the fastest restoration time. And customer satisfaction is an all-time high at ACE, Delmarva and Pepco. 
We're also delivering on our promise to be a true partner with the communities we serve. PHI utilities have contributed more than $470 million in total economic impact since the merger closed. In 2018 alone, these utilities spent $313 million with minority and women-owned suppliers, which is between 22% and 29% of each utility's total procurement spend. 
Each utility has made investments in workforce development programs, including partnering with the District of Colombia to create the DC Infrastructure Academy. We are also an important community partner for hundreds of organizations in the PHI service territory, contributing more than $15 million in financial support and volunteering approximately 85,000 hours since the merger was approved. 
Because of the improved service and the enhanced partnership with our communities, we are building trust in our jurisdictions and are seeing a more positive regulatory environment develop. Since the merger, we have reached constructive settlements in each of the PHI jurisdictions, including Pepco, Maryland and DC and we've had our first settlement since 1980s. 
Exelon has delivered on the promises we've made to our customers and the communities and the shareholders when we merged with PHI in 2016. 
Turning to our financial results on Slide 6. We had a strong quarter. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.93 per share versus $0.60 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.87 per share versus $0.96 per share last year. 
Joe will cover the drivers in his remarks. Turning to Slide 7, at the utilities we continue to execute at top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are resulting in improved reliability, which is strengthening up the relationship of our customers and the regulators. We remain focused on helping our customers and communities become more energy-efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years, and I'm happy to say once again the EPA named all 5 of our eligible companies BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, PECO and Pepco as 2018 ENERGY STAR Partners of the Year. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatts hours of 0 emission electricity with a capacity factor of 97.1%. The best quarter performance in more than 10 years during the polar vortex, where the temperatures were significantly below 0, our fleet brand at full power keeping families in our markets safe and warm. Exelon power and gas and Hydro dispatch match of 97.8% and wind and solar capture of 96.5%, exceeding plan. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a number of important developments. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the clean energy programs. Illinois is looking to advance its clean energy goals. Pennsylvania is considering adding nuclear to its alternative energy standard. New Jersey awarded 0 emission credits. PJM has made a scarcity filing in March with the request approval date by mid-December and FERC acted on -- passed our energy pricing reforms. These actions recognize the importance of preserving the existing resources of carbon-free energy. 
Addressing -- in addressing the underlying deficiencies in the market. In Illinois, legislation was introduced that would require the Illinois Power Authority to procure clean capacity for ComEd customers using the fixed resource requirement mechanism that is currently in the PGM [ tariff ]. In addition to supported a course of truly clean energy future, in Illinois the legislation would also ensure that consumers pay less than they do today. 
The concept of the FRR has a wide support and has been endorsed by the Illinois -- the Clean Jobs Coalition and organized labor. Another piece of legislation has been introduced into Illinois to extend the formula rate -- ComEd's formula rate provides tangible benefits to the consumers as well as certainty we need to make investments and improve reliability and resiliency in customer service while keeping the bills affordable. In the 9 years that ComEd has filed a formula rate we have asked for rate decreases 4 times. 
It's a busy legislative season as Governor Pritzer and the General Assembly tackle Illinois' significant budget problems. However, we are optimistic these 2 priorities can get done this year. In Pennsylvania, a bipartisan group in the House and the Senate introduced legislation that would treat nuclear equal to other non [emission] resources by adding to ultimate energy portfolio standard. 
Several hearings have been held in the House and Senate on the bill, but it's not clear the action will be taken in time to reverse our decision to retire TMI. We also achieved 2 important milestones for our existing ZEC programs in April. First, as mentioned, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the challenges, the New York and Illinois ZEC programs consistent with the resounding decision we received in the district and the circuit courts. 
Second, the New Jersey BPU awarded ZECs to all 3 New Jersey -- units in New Jersey allowing them to continue to provide 0 carbon energy to the state. We are pleased to see the states [ moving forward ] with thoughtful energy policy that preserves the rights to chart a clean energy future. 
Finally, turning to FERC and PJM. We are pleased FREC acted on a Fast Start reforms that expand the price setting and eligibility for block-loaded resources. FERC has requested that PJM submit a compliance filing by July 31 and we expect the reforms to be implemented shortly after that. 
In addition, PJM filed a 206 petition to improve the pricing of reserves, which we have previously referred to as scarcity or ORDC reforms. These reforms, along with baseload price formation are essential to preserve an effective competitive market in PJM, and we're happy to see the programs being made to address these clear needs. 
Turning to Slide 9. Much of the policy work we've engaged in, including preserving 0 carbon Generation, we have viewed as necessary to bridge a comprehensive carbon policy. In the past time, not just for the government, but for every business, most particularly energy business, along with their customers and stakeholders take action on reducing carbon emissions. For several decades, Exelon has been positioning itself for a carbon constrained world and acting as a leader, advocating for carbon policy at the state and federal level. 
We have built the cleanest power generation company in the country. We have divested or retired all of our coal generation and invested in renewables and increasing our output of our nuclear footprint. As a result, Exelon has produced more clean energy than any other company in the United States by a factor of 2 and out of 9 -- every 9 clean megawatts in the U.S. comes from an Exelon plant. 
We've avoided 67.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas, equivalent of making -- taking 14.5 million cars off the road through 2 previous carbon reduction goals. And we are on track to meet the most recent goal of 15% additional reduction of emissions from internal operations. 
We are the leading voice in supporting policies and regulations that require reduced emissions and encourage technology changes. And across our businesses, we are working to enable clean energy solutions to our customers and communities. 
In 2018 alone, our energy efficiency programs saved customers 21.9 million-megawatt hours of electricity, avoiding 9.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission. We're investing in electric transportation and charging infrastructure at both utilities and Constellation. 
Exelon is also involved in grid scale energy storage development to enable faster and greater reliability for the use of renewables. One example of this is through our efforts to launch the Volta Energy, which works with the national labs and research universities to commercialize new technologies. 
There world is changing in terms of awareness of the scope of climate change and the need for a new potential solutions. Our customers are sitting in our communities as well as our employees are demanding clean power so that is what we intend to provide. We still have a long way to go but the engagements that we are seeing at the state level affirms our view that these policies will be part of our country's future. 
With that, now I'll turn it over with Joe to continue the call."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financially. We earned $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
Our performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, including a positive $0.01 of net benefit around timing and expenses. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly well within our plan due to O&M timing that commented PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. 
Exelon Generation earned $0.30 per share, outperforming plan. This was a result of some realized gain in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and favorable timing of OEM. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. For the second quarter, we are providing adjusted operating earnings guidance from $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.87 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.09 per share lower than the first quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.10 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completed rate [increases] and lower storing cost at PECO with BGE relative to the first quarter of 2018. 
Generation earnings were down $0.19 per share compared with last year. The biggest driver was the absence of $0.10 per share of ZEC catch-up payments from 2017 due to the timing of the final Illinois ZEC approvals. Generation was also impacted by lower realized power prices. 
Moving on to Slide 12. As Chris mentioned, we celebrated the third anniversary of the merger with PHI in March. We have seen tremendous improvement in PHI's operational performance, customer satisfaction and relationships with our communities and regulators, which is leading to more constructive outcomes. 
Given our progress on the commitment of our 9% to 10% ROEs across our utility and the quarterly variability at the individual PHI utilities depending on rate case timing, we are now consolidating the PHI utilities trailing 12 months ROEs. We have also changed the format of the slide to show the relative size of the aggregate PHI utility when compared to legacy Exelon utility and the consolidated Exelon Utilities. 
In total, the PHI utilities represent approximately 26% of our total rate base of $41.2 billion. On a consolidated basis, the PHI utilities earned a 9.3% ROE for the trailing 12 months. This is a 90-basis-point improvement over consolidated 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement is due to 2018 distribution rate case settlements at both Delmarva and Pepco, favorable transmission revenue from the higher peak load and true-ups, a roll-off of higher storage cost and favorable O&M timing at Delmarva and Pepco, which will reverse over the course of the year. 
At the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs are modestly better, largely driven by the roll-off of the March 2018 winter storm cost as well as new rates associated with completed rate cases at PECO and PG&E. Including PHI, the combined Exelon Utilities have a 10.2% earned ROE, which is above our 9% to 10% earned ROE target and 50 basis points higher than last quarter. 
We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROE at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. Turning to Slide 13, since the last call, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the Atlantic City Electric settlement agreement, which provides for a $70 million revenue increase. The new rates came into effect on April 1. In addition, the BPU approved recovery of $96 million of capital over a 4-year period through the infrastructure investment program to improve reliability. 
On April 8, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission, seeking a $6.4 million decrease to base rate, representing the fourth requested rate reduction on under the formula rate design. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
Pepco Maryland filed its latest rate case in January, requesting a $30 million revenue increase, which has been updated to $27.2 million with the test year update to actuals. The request is based on the continued infrastructure investments to enhance reliability and customer service. We expect to receive an order in the third quarter of this year. 
More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 14. During the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital across the utility and are on track to meet our $5.3 billion commitment for 2019. These investments will improve the reliability and resiliency of the grid to the benefit of our customers. 
This quarter I would like to highlight 2 projects: the first is the modernization of Pepco's Harrison substation in Washington, D.C. This $190 million project will renovate aging infrastructure to more reliably serve important loads, including 2 metro stations. It also expands regional transmission capacity, supporting future load growth. 
The other project is the second phase of BG&E's large gas line replacement program in Baltimore that will be recovered through strident capital recovery methods. The second phase includes $732 million of investment and will replace approximately 240 miles of gas lines by the end of 2023. 
Replacing these lines will improve the safety and reliability of the distribution system. During the first phase of the program, PG&E replaced 208 miles of gas line. Since the program started in 2014, STRIDE has created 600 full time jobs in PG&E service territory. 
On Slide 15, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy with the Generation company. As a reminder, our disclosure previously reflected the planned retirement of PMI and include New Jersey's ZEC revenues. Since last quarter total gross margin was flat in every year. 
In 2019, open gross margin decreased $150 million, primarily due to lower pricing at West Hub, New York's Zone A and NiHub.
During the quarter, we executed $150 million in powering new business. In 2020 and '21, respectively, open gross margin is up $50 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily on the back of higher prior prices at NiHub and New York's Zone A which was partially offset by lower ERCOT's arc spread. 
Mark-to-market of hedges were down $50 million due to our hedge position offsetting the increase in gross margin and we executed $50 million of power new business in both years. Our Generation to load matching strategy continues to yield positive results. We ended the quarter 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges. 
Our open position is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are comfortable with our strategy to hold open market [indiscernible]. 
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. As Chris mentioned, our working [indiscernible] rewarded credit upgrade at S&P and Fitch in the first quarter. S&P upgraded Exelon issuer credit rating from BBB+ from BBB. In addition, all subsidiaries we're raised 1 notch. According to S&P, the rating upgrades reflect the successful execution of our business strategy, which has reduced business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. 
Fitch also upgraded Exelon to BBB+ based on similar reasons. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We continue to use free cash from the Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of our growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting Generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend annually at 5% through 2020.

So there are numerous energy related bills to get to that point. Our bill for the FRR, there's one that's a path to 100, and then there is one that's the clean jobs coalition. So we're in the process right now of negotiating with all the bills so we can come together and provide the legislature with a coalition that agrees on many things right now. Just working through the details. We hope to be done. Meetings are constant. I've met with the leadership of both House and Senate, talking about what we need to do and them showing their support for us going forward. So we're just going to keep on working on it as we always do. If it's not done in the regular session because of the other priorities, we will have a position to move through during the veto session. That's the Generation bill. The other bill in Illinois that will affect Exelon is the extension of the ComEd formula rate for 10 years. That bill is proceeding. We've been able to work with stakeholders to gain support and recognition. As I mentioned, out of the 9 past filings that we made with the formula rate, we've had 4 rate reductions. So it's very balanced for the consumer. It's very balanced for our investment strategy, and we are able to do so in a predictable way to serve our customers. So that's Illinois. Pennsylvania -- yes."

During the quarter, we achieved success on several key fronts and reached a couple of milestones. First, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the ZEC cases clearing the last legal challenge at the federal level for the Illinois and New York programs. The decision affirms that the states have the right to protect their citizens by favoring clean energy and it is a win for the consumers, policymakers and regulators. 
Second, we received credit upgrades from both S&P and Fitch. These upgrades recognize the successful execution on our utility-driven growth strategy and reduction in business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Third, we reached settlements in New Jersey on the ACE rate case and the infrastructure investment program. These outcomes reflect the continued positive evolution of our partnership with regulators built on improvement and reliability and customer satisfaction. 
Finally, turning to Slide 5, in March, we celebrated the 7th anniversary of the Constellation merger and the 3rd anniversary of the PHI merger. Each merger has positively contributed to our strategy of increasing our regulated business mix and providing more stable earnings. Before these mergers, Exelon earned a mix of 28% utilities, 72% generation. In 2021, we project that mix will have flopped with nearly 70% earnings coming from the utilities. 
Both through the Constellation merger, we grew our regulated earnings with the addition of BGE and also benefited from the combination of Exelon and Constellation's competitive business, creating an industry leader integrated business that supports efficiently hedging of our plants while capturing incremental margins and cash flows. 
The PHI merger further advanced our strategy to become more regulated while creating value for customers and communities we serve. We are meeting or exceeding all of our reliability merger commitments in customer or across the PHI service territory and are experiencing record reliability. 
The frequency and duration of outages have improved at each utility, customers are out of power less frequency -- with less frequency and are restored to service much faster when out of power. In 2018, Delmarva customers had the lowest frequency of outages. At Pepco, customers saw the fastest restoration time. And customer satisfaction is an all-time high at ACE, Delmarva and Pepco. 
We're also delivering on our promise to be a true partner with the communities we serve. The PHI utilities have contributed more than $470 million in total economic impact since the merger closed. In 2018 alone, these utilities spent $313 million with minority and women-owned suppliers, which is between 22% and 29% of each utility's total procurement spend. 
Each utility has made investments in workforce development programs, including partnering with the District of Colombia to create the DC Infrastructure Academy. We are also an important community partner for hundreds of organizations in the PHI service territory, contributing more than $15 million in financial support and volunteering approximately 85,000 hours since the merger was approved. 
Because of the improved service and the enhanced partnership with our communities, we are building trust in our jurisdictions and are seeing a more positive regulatory environment develop. Since the merger, we have reached constructions up -- constructive settlements in each of the PHI jurisdictions, including Pepco, Maryland and DC and we've had our first settlement since 1980s. 
Exelon has delivered on the promises we've made to our customers and the communities and the shareholders when we merged with PHI in 2016. 
Turning to our financial results on Slide 6. We had a strong quarter. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.93 per share versus $0.60 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.87 per share versus $0.96 per share last year. 
Joe will cover the drivers in his remarks. Turning to Slide 7, at the utilities we continue to execute at the top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are resulting in improved reliability, which is strengthening up the relationship with our customers and the regulators. We remained focused on helping our customers and communities to become more energy-efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years, and I'm happy to say once again the EPA named all 5 of our eligible companies BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, PECO and Pepco as 2018 ENERGY STAR Partners of the Year. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatts hours of 0 emission electricity with a capacity factor of 97.1%. The best quarter performance in more than 10 years during the polar vortex, where the temperatures were significantly below 0, our fleet brand at full power keeping families in our markets safe and warm. Exelon power and gas and Hydro dispatch match of 97.8% and wind and solar capture of 96.5%, exceeding plan. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a number of important developments. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the clean as of the -- the clean energy programs. Illinois is looking to advance its clean energy goals. Pennsylvania is considering adding nuclear to its alternative energy standard. New Jersey awarded 0 emission credits. PJM has made a scarcity filing in March with the request approval made by mid-December and FERC act on -- passed our energy pricing reforms. These actions recognize the importance of preserving the existing resources of carbon-free energy. 
Addressing -- in addressing the underlying deficiencies in the market. In Illinois, legislation was introduced that would require the Illinois Power Authority to procure clean capacity for ComEd customers using the fixed resource requirement mechanism that is currently in the PJM tariff. In addition to supporting a course of truly clean energy future, in Illinois the legislation would also ensure that consumers pay less than they do today. 
The concept of the FRR has a wide support and has been endorsed by the Illinois hub -- the Clean Jobs Coalition and organized labor. Another piece of legislation has been introduced into Illinois to extend the formula rate -- ComEd's formula rate provides tangible benefits to the consumers as well as certainty we need to make investments and improve reliability and resiliency in customer service while keeping the bills affordable. In the 9 years that ComEd has filed a formula rate we have asked for rate decreases 4 times. 
It's a busy legislative season as Governor Pritzer and the General Assembly tackle Illinois' significant budget problems. However, we are optimistic these 2 priorities can get done this year. In Pennsylvania, a bipartisan group in the House and the Senate introduced legislation that would treat nuclear equal to other non --  I mean, resources by adding it to the ultimate energy portfolio standard. 
Several hearings have been held in the House and Senate on the bill, but it's not clear the action will be taken in time to reverse our decision to retire TMI. We also achieved 2 important milestones for our existing ZEC programs in April. First, as mentioned, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the challenges, the New York and the Illinois ZEC programs consistent with the resounding decision we received in the district and the circuit courts. 
Second, the New Jersey BPU awarded ZECs to all 3 New Jersey -- units in New Jersey allowing them to continue to provide 0 carbon energy to the state. We are pleased to see the states moving forward with thoughtful energy policy that preserves the rights to chart a clean energy future. 
Finally, turning to FERC and PJM. We are pleased FERC acted on a Fast Start reforms that expand the price setting and eligibility for block-loaded resources. FERC has requested that PJM submit a compliance filing by July 31 and we expect the reforms to be implemented shortly after that. 
In addition, PJM filed a 206 petition to improve the pricing of reserves, which we have previously referred to as scarcity or ORDC reforms. These reforms, along with baseload price formation are essential to preserve an effective competitive market in PJM, and we're happy to see the programs being made to address these clear needs. 
Turning to Slide 9. Much of the policy work we've engaged in, including preserving 0 carbon generation, we have viewed as necessary to bridge a comprehensive carbon policy. In the past time, not just for the government, but for every business, most particularly energy business, along with their customers and stakeholders to take action on reducing carbon emissions. For several decades, Exelon has been positioning itself for a carbon constrained world and acting as a leader, advocating for carbon policy at the state and federal level. 
We have built the cleanest power generation company in the country. We have divested or retired all of our coal generation and invested in renewables and increasing our output of our nuclear footprint. As a result, Exelon has produced more clean energy than any other company in the United States by a factor of 2 and out of 9 -- every 9 clean megawatts in the U.S. comes from an Exelon plant. 
We've avoided 67.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas, the equivalent of making or -- taking 14.5 million cars off the road through 2 previous carbon reduction goals. And we are on track to meet the most recent goal of 15% additional reduction of emissions from internal operations. 
We are the leading voice in supporting policies and regulations that require reduced emissions and encourage technology changes. And across our businesses, we are working to enable clean energy solutions to our customers and communities. 
In 2018 alone, our energy efficiency programs saved customers 21.9 million-megawatt hours of electricity, avoiding 9.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission. We're investing in electric transportation and charging infrastructure at both utilities and Constellation. 
Exelon is also involved in grid scale energy storage development to enable faster and greater reliability for the use of renewables. One example of this is through our efforts to launch the Volta Energy, which works with the national labs and research universities to commercialize new technologies. 
There world is changing in terms of awareness of the scope of climate change and the need for a new potential solutions. Our customers are sitting in our communities as well as our employees are demanding clean power so that is what we intend to provide. We still have a long way to go but the engagements that we are seeing at the state level affirms our view that these policies will be part of our country's future. 
With that, now I'll turn it over with Joe to continue the call."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financia",1326,"Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financially. We earned $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
Our performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, including a positive $0.01 of net benefit around timing and expenses. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly well within our plan due to O&M timing that commented PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. 
Exelon Generation earned $0.30 per share, outperforming plan. This was a result of some realized gain in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and favorable timing of OEM. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. For the second quarter, we are providing adjusted operating earnings guidance from $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.87 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.09 per share lower than the first quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.10 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completed rate increases and lower storing cost at PECO with BGE relative to the first quarter of 2018. 
Generation earnings were down $0.19 per share compared with last year. The biggest driver was the absence of $0.10 per share of ZEC catch-up payments from 2017 due to the timing of the final Illinois ZEC approvals. Generation was also impacted by lower realized power prices. 
Moving on to Slide 12. As Chris mentioned, we celebrated the third anniversary of the merger with PHI in March. We have seen tremendous improvement in PHI's operational performance, customer satisfaction and relationships with our communities and regulators, which is leading to more constructive outcomes. 
Given our progress on the commitment of our 9% to 10% ROEs across our utility and the quarterly variability at the individual PHI utilities depending on rate case timing, we are now consolidating the PHI utilities trailing 12 months ROEs. We have also changed the format of the slide to show the relative size of the aggregate PHI utility when compared to legacy Exelon utility and the consolidated Exelon Utilities. 
In total, the PHI utilities represent approximately 26% of our total rate base of $41.2 billion. On a consolidated basis, the PHI utilities earned a 9.3% ROEs for the trailing 12 months. This is a 90-basis-point improvement over consolidated 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement is due to 2018 distribution rate case settlements at both Delmarva and Pepco, favorable transmission revenue from the higher peak load and true-ups, a roll-off of higher store cost and favorable O&M timing at Delmarva and Pepco, which will reverse over the course of the year. 
At the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs are modestly better, largely driven by the roll-off of the March 2018 winter storm cost as well as new rates associated with completed rate cases at PECO and PG&E. Including PHI, the combined Exelon Utilities have a 10.2% earned ROE, which is above our 9% to 10% earned ROE target and 50 basis points higher than last quarter. 
We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROE at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. Turning to Slide 13, since the last call, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the Atlantic City Electric settlement agreement, which provides for a $70 million revenue increase. The new rates went into effect on April 1. In addition, the BPU approved recovery of $96 million of capital over a 4-year period through the infrastructure investment program to improve reliability. 
On April 8, ComEd filed it's annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission, seeking a $6.4 million decrease to base rate, representing the fourth requested rate reduction under the formula rate design. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
Pepco Maryland filed its latest rate case in January, requesting a $30 million revenue increase, which has been updated to $27.2 million with the test year update to actuals. The request is based on the continued infrastructure investments to enhance reliability and customer service. We expect to receive an order in the third quarter of this year. 
More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 14. During the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital across the utility and are on track to meet our $5.3 billion commitments for 2019. These investments will improve the reliability and resiliency of the grid to the benefit of our customers. 
This quarter I would like to highlight 2 projects: the first is the modernization of Pepco's Harrison substation in Washington, D.C. This $190 million project will renovate aging infrastructure to more reliably serve important loads, including 2 metro stations. It also expands regional transmission capacity, supporting future load growth. 
The other project is the second phase of PG&E's large gas line replacement program in Baltimore that will be recovered through strident capital recovery methods. The second phase includes $732 million of investment and will replace approximately 240 miles of gas lines by the end of 2023. 
Replacing these lines will improve the safety and reliability of the distribution system. During the first phase of the program, PG&E replaced 208 miles of gas line. Since the program started in 2014, STRIDE has created 600 full time jobs in PG&E service territory. 
On Slide 15, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy with the Generation company. As a reminder, our disclosure previously reflected the planned retirement of PMI and include New Jersey's ZEC revenues. Since last quarter total gross margin was flat in every year. 
In 2019, open gross margin decreased to $150 million, primarily due to lower prices at West Hub, New York's Zone A and NiHub.
During the quarter, we executed $150 million in our new business. In 2020 and '21, respectively, open gross margin is up $50 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily on the back of higher prior prices at NiHub and New York's Zone A which was partially offset by lower ERCOT's arc spread. 
Mark-to-market of hedges were down $50 million due to our hedge position offsetting the increase in gross margin and we executed $50 million of power new business in both years. Our Generation to load matching strategy continues to yield positive results. We ended the quarter 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges. 
Our open position is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are comfortable with our strategy to hold 
every market line.
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. As Chris mentioned, our working have rewarded in credit upgrade at S&P and Fitch in the first quarter. S&P upgraded Exelon issuer credit rating from -- to BBB+ from BBB. In addition, all subsidiaries we're raised 1 notch. According to S&P, the rating upgrades reflect the successful execution of our business strategy, which has reduced business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. 
Fitch also upgraded Exelon to BBB+ based on similar reasons. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And as you pointed out, there is a lot of activity in the session right now as the Governor prioritizes all of his issues. A lot of it is focused on the budget and revenue sources. Those bills are moving and being debated as we discussed. He also has a priority on achieving a 0 carbon generation fleet by the 2020 -- 30 time frame -- 2030 time frame. So there are numerous energy related bills to get to that point. Our bill for the FRR, there's one that's a path to 100, and then there is one that's the clean jobs coalition. So we're in the process right now of negotiating with all the bills so we can come together and provide the legislature with a coalition that agrees on many things right now. Just working through the details. We hope to be done. Meetings are constant. I've met with the leadership of both House and Senate, talking about what we need to do and them showing their support for us going forward. So we're just going to keep on working on it as we always do. If it's not done in the regular session because of the other priorities, we will have a position to move through during the veto session. That's the Generation bill. The other bill in Illinois that will affect Exelon is the extension of the ComEd formula rate for 10 years. That bill is proceeding. We've been able to work with stakeholders to gain support and recognition. As I mentioned, out of the 9 past filings that we made with the formula rate, we've had 4 rate reductions. So it's very balanced for the consumer. It's very balanced for our investment strategy, and we are able to do so in a predictable way to serve our customers. So that's Illinois. Pennsylvania -- yes."

We won't be able to adequately procure -- design, procure, manufacture fuel for continued operations without that certainty and would not want to make that investment without that. So we'll continue working on it. As you can see, the Governor has shown recognition that he wants to have a low carbon future for the state and all recognize that, that cannot be done with the current technology without including the existing nuclear assets.

So we think it should be an April time frame but FERC feels -- but PJM feels like they're compelled to run forward, and hopefully, we'll hear something from FERC to clarify PJM's letter requesting clarification. The most likely scenario for an FRR in Illinois would be the 23 auction time frame from everything we're looking at. We need to get the legislation passed, we need to have the IPA, who we've been working within our power authority, to be able to build a construct to be able to run it. That estimate is aggressive on our side by about 8 months. Our folks have been in communications with the IPA to see how reasonable that is. And so we'll continue to work down that path.

And the reason for that is that the reason the future energy JOBS Act was so successful is it brought together a number of parties together towards a common future and what's exciting about this is that this FRR concept is integral to all the other clean energy bills that are being considered right now because everyone appreciates that is that exact authority, letting that IPA conduct a clean energy capacity procurement and then having the ability to set its course towards a 0 carbon future will give it more flexibility than it has under current market rules where every asset gets the same capacity theme whether it's emitting or non emitting. So we have left some room to have that discussion among stakeholders to make sure that we have the right group who are supporting it and as Chris said at the top of the call, between the clean jobs coalition, including this in their bill, the consumer advocacy, the tremendous benefit associated with this, we think that's the winning combination."

During the quarter, we achieved success on several key fronts and reached a couple of milestones. First, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the ZEC cases clearing the last legal challenge at the federal level for the Illinois and New York programs. The decision affirms that the states have the right to protect their citizens by favoring clean energy and it is a win for the consumers, policymakers and regulators. 
Second, we received credit upgrades from both S&P and Fitch. These upgrades recognize the successful execution on our utility-driven growth strategy and reduction in business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Third, we reached settlements in New Jersey on the ACE rate case and the infrastructure investment program. These outcomes reflect the continued positive evolution of our partnership with regulators built on improvement and reliability and customer satisfaction. 
Finally, turning to Slide 5, in March, we celebrated the 7th anniversary of the Constellation merger and the 3rd anniversary of the PHI merger. Each merger has positively contributed to our strategy of increasing our regulated business mix and providing more stable earnings. Before these mergers, Exelon earned a mix of 28% utilities, 72% generation. In 2021, we project that mix will have flopped with nearly 70% earnings coming from the utilities. 
Both through the Constellation merger, we grew our regulated earnings with the addition of BGE and also benefited from the combination of Exelon and Constellation's competitive business, creating an industry leader integrated business that supports efficiently hedging of our plants while capturing incremental margins and cash flows. 
The PHI merger further advanced our strategy to become more regulated while creating value for customers and communities we serve. We are meeting or exceeding all of our reliability merger commitments in customer or across the PHI service territory and are experiencing record reliability. 
The frequency and duration of outages have improved at each utility, customers are out of power less frequency -- with less frequency and are restored to service much faster when out of power. In 2018, Delmarva customers had the lowest frequency of outages. At Pepco, customers saw the fastest restoration time. And customer satisfaction is an all-time high at ACE, Delmarva and Pepco. 
We're also delivering on our promise to be a true partner with the communities we serve. The PHI utilities have contributed more than $470 million in total economic impact since the merger closed. In 2018 alone, these utilities spent $313 million with minority and women-owned suppliers, which is between 22% and 29% of each utility's total procurement spend. 
Each utility has made investments in workforce development programs, including partnering with the District of Colombia to create the DC Infrastructure Academy. We are also an important community partner for hundreds of organizations in the PHI service territory, contributing more than $15 million in financial support and volunteering approximately 85,000 hours since the merger was approved. 
Because of the improved service and the enhanced partnership with our communities, we are building trust in our jurisdictions and are seeing a more positive regulatory environment develop. Since the merger, we have reached constructions up -- constructive settlements in each of the PHI jurisdictions, including Pepco, Maryland and DC and we've had our first settlement since 1980s. 
Exelon has delivered on the promises we've made to our customers and the communities and the shareholders when we merged with PHI in 2016. 
Turning to our financial results on Slide 6. We had a strong quarter. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.93 per share versus $0.60 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.87 per share versus $0.96 per share last year. 
Joe will cover the drivers in his remarks. Turning to Slide 7, at the utilities we continue to execute at the top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are resulting in improved reliability, which is strengthening up the relationship with our customers and the regulators. We remained focused on helping our customers and communities to become more energy-efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years, and I'm happy to say once again the EPA named all 5 of our eligible companies BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, PECO and Pepco as 2018 ENERGY STAR Partners of the Year. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatts hours of 0 emission electricity with a capacity factor of 97.1%. The best quarter performance in more than 10 years during the polar vortex, where the temperatures were significantly below 0, our fleet brand at full power keeping families in our markets safe and warm. Exelon power and gas and Hydro dispatch match of 97.8% and wind and solar capture of 96.5%, exceeding plan. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a number of important developments. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the clean as of the -- the clean energy programs. Illinois is looking to advance its clean energy goals. Pennsylvania is considering adding nuclear to its alternative energy standard. New Jersey awarded 0 emission credits. PJM has made a scarcity filing in March with the request approval made by mid-December and FERC act on -- passed our energy pricing reforms. These actions recognize the importance of preserving the existing resources of carbon-free energy. 
Addressing -- in addressing the underlying deficiencies in the market. In Illinois, legislation was introduced that would require the Illinois Power Authority to procure clean capacity for ComEd customers using the fixed resource requirement mechanism that is currently in the PJM tariff. In addition to supporting a course of truly clean energy future, in Illinois the legislation would also ensure that consumers pay less than they do today. 
The concept of the FRR has a wide support and has been endorsed by the Illinois hub -- the Clean Jobs Coalition and organized labor. Another piece of legislation has been introduced into Illinois to extend the formula rate -- ComEd's formula rate provides tangible benefits to the consumers as well as certainty we need to make investments and improve reliability and resiliency in customer service while keeping the bills affordable. In the 9 years that ComEd has filed a formula rate we have asked for rate decreases 4 times. 
It's a busy legislative season as Governor Pritzer and the General Assembly tackle Illinois' significant budget problems. However, we are optimistic these 2 priorities can get done this year. In Pennsylvania, a bipartisan group in the House and the Senate introduced legislation that would treat nuclear equal to other non --  I mean, resources by adding it to the ultimate energy portfolio standard. 
Several hearings have been held in the House and Senate on the bill, but it's not clear the action will be taken in time to reverse our decision to retire TMI. We also achieved 2 important milestones for our existing ZEC programs in April. First, as mentioned, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the challenges, the New York and the Illinois ZEC programs consistent with the resounding decision we received in the district and the circuit courts. 
Second, the New Jersey BPU awarded ZECs to all 3 New Jersey -- units in New Jersey allowing them to continue to provide 0 carbon energy to the state. We are pleased to see the states moving forward with thoughtful energy policy that preserves the rights to chart a clean energy future. 
Finally, turning to FERC and PJM. We are pleased FERC acted on a Fast Start reforms that expand the price setting and eligibility for block-loaded resources. FERC has requested that PJM submit a compliance filing by July 31 and we expect the reforms to be implemented shortly after that. 
In addition, PJM filed a 206 petition to improve the pricing of reserves, which we have previously referred to as scarcity or ORDC reforms. These reforms, along with baseload price formation are essential to preserve an effective competitive market in PJM, and we're happy to see the programs being made to address these clear needs. 
Turning to Slide 9. Much of the policy work we've engaged in, including preserving 0 carbon generation, we have viewed as necessary to bridge a comprehensive carbon policy. In the past time, not just for the government, but for every business, most particularly energy business, along with their customers and stakeholders to take action on reducing carbon emissions. For several decades, Exelon has been positioning itself for a carbon constrained world and acting as a leader, advocating for carbon policy at the state and federal level. 
We have built the cleanest power generation company in the country. We have divested or retired all of our coal generation and invested in renewables and increasing our output of our nuclear footprint. As a result, Exelon has produced more clean energy than any other company in the United States by a factor of 2 and out of 9 -- every 9 clean megawatts in the U.S. comes from an Exelon plant. 
We've avoided 67.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas, the equivalent of making or -- taking 14.5 million cars off the road through 2 previous carbon reduction goals. And we are on track to meet the most recent goal of 15% additional reduction of emissions from internal operations. 
We are the leading voice in supporting policies and regulations that require reduced emissions and encourage technology changes. And across our businesses, we are working to enable clean energy solutions to our customers and communities. 
In 2018 alone, our energy efficiency programs saved customers 21.9 million-megawatt hours of electricity, avoiding 9.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission. We're investing in electric transportation and charging infrastructure at both utilities and Constellation. 
Exelon is also involved in grid scale energy storage development to enable faster and greater reliability for the use of renewables. One example of this is through our efforts to launch the Volta Energy, which works with the national labs and research universities to commercialize new technologies. 
There world is changing in terms of awareness of the scope of climate change and the need for a new potential solutions. Our customers are sitting in our communities as well as our employees are demanding clean power so that is what we intend to provide. We still have a long way to go but the engagements that we are seeing at the state level affirms our view that these policies will be part of our country's future. 
With that, now I'll turn it over with Joe to continue the call."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financia",1326,"Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter result and quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with Slide #10, we had a strong quarter financially. We earned $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
Our performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, including a positive $0.01 of net benefit around timing and expenses. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly well within our plan due to O&M timing that commented PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. 
Exelon Generation earned $0.30 per share, outperforming plan. This was a result of some realized gain in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and favorable timing of OEM. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. For the second quarter, we are providing adjusted operating earnings guidance from $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.87 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.09 per share lower than the first quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.10 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completed rate increases and lower storing cost at PECO with BGE relative to the first quarter of 2018. 
Generation earnings were down $0.19 per share compared with last year. The biggest driver was the absence of $0.10 per share of ZEC catch-up payments from 2017 due to the timing of the final Illinois ZEC approvals. Generation was also impacted by lower realized power prices. 
Moving on to Slide 12. As Chris mentioned, we celebrated the third anniversary of the merger with PHI in March. We have seen tremendous improvement in PHI's operational performance, customer satisfaction and relationships with our communities and regulators, which is leading to more constructive outcomes. 
Given our progress on the commitment of our 9% to 10% ROEs across our utility and the quarterly variability at the individual PHI utilities depending on rate case timing, we are now consolidating the PHI utilities trailing 12 months ROEs. We have also changed the format of the slide to show the relative size of the aggregate PHI utility when compared to legacy Exelon utility and the consolidated Exelon Utilities. 
In total, the PHI utilities represent approximately 26% of our total rate base of $41.2 billion. On a consolidated basis, the PHI utilities earned a 9.3% ROEs for the trailing 12 months. This is a 90-basis-point improvement over consolidated 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement is due to 2018 distribution rate case settlements at both Delmarva and Pepco, favorable transmission revenue from the higher peak load and true-ups, a roll-off of higher store cost and favorable O&M timing at Delmarva and Pepco, which will reverse over the course of the year. 
At the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs are modestly better, largely driven by the roll-off of the March 2018 winter storm cost as well as new rates associated with completed rate cases at PECO and PG&E. Including PHI, the combined Exelon Utilities have a 10.2% earned ROE, which is above our 9% to 10% earned ROE target and 50 basis points higher than last quarter. 
We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROE at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. Turning to Slide 13, since the last call, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the Atlantic City Electric settlement agreement, which provides for a $70 million revenue increase. The new rates went into effect on April 1. In addition, the BPU approved recovery of $96 million of capital over a 4-year period through the infrastructure investment program to improve reliability. 
On April 8, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission, seeking a $6.4 million decrease to base rate, representing the fourth requested rate reduction under the formula rate design. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
Pepco Maryland filed its latest rate case in January, requesting a $30 million revenue increase, which has been updated to $27.2 million with the test year update to actuals. The request is based on the continued infrastructure investments to enhance reliability and customer service. We expect to receive an order in the third quarter of this year. 
More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 14. During the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital across the utility and are on track to meet our $5.3 billion commitments for 2019. These investments will improve the reliability and resiliency of the grid to the benefit of our customers. 
This quarter I would like to highlight 2 projects: the first is the modernization of Pepco's Harrison substation in Washington, D.C. This $190 million project will renovate aging infrastructure to more reliably serve important loads, including 2 metro stations. It also expands regional transmission capacity, supporting future load growth. 
The other project is the second phase of PG&E's large gas line replacement program in Baltimore that will be recovered through strident capital recovery methods. The second phase includes $732 million of investment and will replace approximately 240 miles of gas lines by the end of 2023. 
Replacing these lines will improve the safety and reliability of the distribution system. During the first phase of the program, PG&E replaced 208 miles of gas line. Since the program started in 2014, STRIDE has created 600 full time jobs in PG&E service territory. 
On Slide 15, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy with the Generation company. As a reminder, our disclosure previously reflected the planned retirement of PMI and include New Jersey's ZEC revenues. Since last quarter total gross margin was flat in every year. 
In 2019, open gross margin decreased to $150 million, primarily due to lower prices at West Hub, New York's Zone A and NiHub.
During the quarter, we executed $150 million in our new business. In 2020 and '21, respectively, open gross margin is up $50 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily on the back of higher prior prices at NiHub and New York's Zone A which was partially offset by lower ERCOT's arc spread. 
Mark-to-market of hedges were down $50 million due to our hedge position offsetting the increase in gross margin and we executed $50 million of power new business in both years. Our Generation to load matching strategy continues to yield positive results. We ended the quarter 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges. 
Our open position is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are comfortable with our strategy to hold every market line.
Moving on to Slide 16. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. As Chris mentioned, our working have rewarded in credit upgrade at S&P and Fitch in the first quarter. S&P upgraded Exelon issuer credit rating from -- to BBB+ from BBB. In addition, all subsidiaries we're raised 1 notch. According to S&P, the rating upgrades reflect the successful execution of our business strategy, which has reduced business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. 
Fitch also upgraded Exelon to BBB+ based on similar reasons. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We continue to use free cash from the Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of our growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting Generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend annually at 5% through 2020.

So there are numerous energy related bills to get to that point. Our bill for the FRR, there's one that's a path to 100, and then there is one that's the clean jobs coalition. So we're in the process right now of negotiating with all the bills so we can come together and provide the legislature with a coalition that agrees on many things right now. Just working through the details. We hope to be done. Meetings are constant. I've met with the leadership of both House and Senate, talking about what we need to do and them showing their support for us going forward. So we're just going to keep on working on it as we always do. If it's not done in the regular session because of the other priorities, we will have a position to move through during the veto session. That's the Generation bill. The other bill in Illinois that will affect Exelon is the extension of the ComEd formula rate for 10 years. That bill is proceeding. We've been able to work with stakeholders to gain support and recognition. As I mentioned, out of the 9 past filings that we made with the formula rate, we've had 4 rate reductions. So it's very balanced for the consumer. It's very balanced for our investment strategy, and we are able to do so in a predictable way to serve our customers. So that's Illinois.

So we think it should be an April time frame but FERC feels -- but PJM feels like they're compelled to run forward, and hopefully, we'll hear something from FERC to clarify PJM's letter requesting clarification. The most likely scenario for an FRR in Illinois would be the 23 auction time frame from everything we're looking at. We need to get the legislation passed, we need to have the IPA, who we've been working within our power authority, to be able to build a construct to be able to run it. That estimate is aggressive on our side by about 8 months. Our folks have been in communications with the IPA to see how reasonable that is. And so we'll continue to work down that path. But to run an auction that's going to be potentially rejected without clarification does not seem like the most efficient use of all of our resources at this time."

And as you note, the bill is not specific about the exact timetable or there -- or other details that we believe are important, including how prices will be overseen by the IPA. And the reason for that is that the reason the future energy JOBS Act was so successful is it brought together a number of parties together towards a common future and what's exciting about this is that this FRR concept is integral to all the other clean energy bills that are being considered right now because everyone appreciates that is that exact authority, letting that IPA conduct a clean energy capacity procurement and then having the ability to set its course towards a 0 carbon future will give it more flexibility than it has under current market rules where every asset gets the same capacity theme whether it's emitting or non emitting. So we have left some room to have that discussion among stakeholders to make sure that we have the right group who are supporting it and as Chris said at the top of the call, between the clean jobs coalition, including this in their bill, the consumer advocacy, the tremendous benefit associated with this, we think that's the winning combination."

Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over the last 3 months. First, we continue to move forward on our utility regulatory strategy filing distribution rate cases at BGE, ComEd and Pepco D.C., reflecting our safety and reliability investments across those service territories. 
In D.C., we file our first multi-year rate case. The plan provides necessary framework to align Pepco's system investments with D.C. policy goals, including grid modernization and further improvements to customer service and reliability. Joe will discuss the details in his remarks. 
Second, last week, Pepco and other parties filed our settlement agreement at FERC for PECO -- PECO, not Pepco, PECO's formula rate transmission rate. The settlement includes a 10.35% ROE, inclusive of our 50 basis points ROE matter. PECO made the original filing in 2017, and we expect the final order for FERC in 2020. 
Third, in June we issued our annual corporate sustainability report marking our performance and sustainability goals and priorities in addition, the benchmarking a air emissions report that found Exelon is the largest generator of zero emissions energy in the U.S., producing 12% of the nations clean energy. Also, that we have the lowest admissions rate emitting meeting at a rate and that is 4x less than the next cleanest generate. 
Fourth, the New Jersey BPU approved ZEC payments for the state nuclear units, including our interest in sale. We appreciate the state support for the carbon-free power produced by these units. 
Fifth, we are unable to get legislation done in Pennsylvania in time to reverse the decision to close CMI this fall. Since then, there have been continued discussions on a path forward for the remaining nuclear plants in the state, including consideration of placing priceline carbon through the regional carbon trading. 
Sixth, we are also pleased the Trumph administration decided not to impose coders on uranium, which would have jeopardized the continued operation of commercial nuclear reactors in The United States. 
And finally, last week, FERC issued an order directing PJM not to run the capacity auction in August. We agree with FERC's decision to delay the auction until the rules are finalized. The delay provides PJM and the state policymakers of time to adjust to the commissions changes. 
Before I turn to the financial results, I also want to address 2 matters you have raised with us recently. Firstly, we received a number of questions from investors about impact on our business from the steep decline in power prices. The decline presents a considerable challenge for us, as you know, our hedging disclosures are a point in time estimates. If you have seen them move up and down in the past, we need to be thoughtful and deliver a response if these prices persist. And we have a variety of levers that we can pull and decisions we can make if this is a future of energy markets. We are pursuing a number of market reforms addressing the financial challenges, many of planned space. 
Against this backdrop, I can also, again, assure you that we will not operate unprofitable or negative free cash flow plants. You've seen us close 1 losing plants in the past and you should expect the discipline to continue if reforms are not 
The bottom line is that fundamental market performs in United States that evolved into lead the nations clean energy climate goals maintain the fuel security and system of we need to sustain an increased electrification of preserving significant economic value through good paying jobs and property taxes. We continue to work state level and international level with work with the Congress and administration to make this happen. 
Second, we have had -- or we received numerous questions from our investors about the in Illinois from U.S. Attorney's office. We are cooperating fully and provided all -- providing all information requested by the U.S. Attorney's office. We simply cannot comment further on the investigation, and we are not going to speculate with our it may affect legislative effects in the Illinois this fall. What we do know about this fall session is there are a number of stakeholders who want to see clean energy legislation enacted. 
Illinois lacks behind other progressive states on clean energy policy. As in clean energy legislation is a priority for many stakeholders include -- in Illinois, including the Utility Board, labor the clean jobs coalition and the renewable community. These stakeholders want to greatly expand their renewable penetration, so the state will be able to achieve the 100% clean energy target by 2030. Kathleen and her team are working with the stakeholders to help crack the legislation -- legislative package and the inform members of general assembly on the benefits of this legislation. 
It's important to remember that while we are putting a real effort into preserving the value of the Generation clean, our focus remains on the utilities. The bulk of our capital investment in majority of our earnings are coming from the regulated business where we continue to see great opportunities to invest in grow to benefit of our customers and communities. 
Now I'll turn to the financial results on Slide 5. We had a good quarter delivering earnings at midpoint range of our guidance. On GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per share versus $0.56 last year on a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $0.71 per last year. Joe will cover these drivers in his remarks. 
Turning to Slide 6. Operational performance of the utility was mixed during the quarter. We continued to perform at top quarter was across reliability and customer operations matrix, whereas safety performance has slipped. Safety is the highest priority and we are focused on ways to improve our safety culture and performance. Outage frequency and outage duration performance is in the top quartile for 3 of our 4 utilities, with ComEd performing in top 
On the customer operations aside, all of our utilities perform top quartile for service level and call abandonment rate. Our relationship with our customers is improving due to the investments we are making to improve reliability and customer experience. These can be seen in our customer satisfaction scores in the recent J.D. Power electrical residential customer satisfaction ratings. 
ComEd our performance in customer satisfaction index. We improved or maintained our rankings in the J.D. Power rankings ranked first in the East mid region -- or midsize region, the first Exelon utility to every be ranked first. 
BGE and PECO maintained their first quartile performance in the large segment and ComEd improved in its rankings to the second quartile. 
Generation performed well during the quarter and nuclear produced 38.8 terawatts hours of zero-emission electricity with a capacity factor of 95.1%. And Exelon Power had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 99.7, exceeding our plan in the wind and solar capture on -- the plan was plan 96%. Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP bas",1637,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROE utility and our hedge disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.39 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher than our plan, largely due to timing of ComEd, BGE and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. This was partially offset by milder weather expected in the Philadelphia area, impacting PECO by $0.01 per share. ExGen earned $0.21 per share behind our plan. At this was a result of lower loaded volumes at that consolation due to mild weather standard outage. These factors where, partially offset by favorable O&M, strong performance of our generation fleet and I realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. 
We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. And for the third quarter, we are providing adjusted operating guidance -- earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
On Slide 8, we share our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.60 per share in the second quarter of this year with $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less earnings were up [ $0.40 ] per share compared with last year. The earnings growth is driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate case and higher transmission revenue side ComEd and PHI relative to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO. Exchange earnings were down $0.13 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by higher revenue from the increasing New York prices and the start of the New Jersey net program.
Moving to Slide 9, our utility ROEs remain strong and we continue to exceed our 9% to 10% earned ROE targets across the utilities. The consolidated PHI utility earned a 9.1% ROE for the trailing 12 months. Compared to last quarter, we had some help from the constructive distribution rate case settlement at ACE, Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, offset by equity infusions across PHI. 
Legacy Exelon utilities maintained its strong 10.5% earned borrowings in the quarter. Importantly, consolidated ROEs across our utilities were 10.2%. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROE PHI and sustaining strong performance in our utilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. On May 24, BGE filed for a combined $148 million rate increase in electric and gas distribution revenues. The requested rate increase includes $81 million and almost $68 million for electric and gas revenues, respectively, based on rate base of $5.4 billion and a requested ROE of 10.3%. The increase is primarily driven by the ongoing need for capital investments to maintain and modernize the electric and gas distribution system. It also reflects moving $15.8 million of revenues currently being recovered via the stride and electric reliability investment surcharges a into rate case. Into base rate. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
On May 30, Pepco filed a multi-year in the District of Columbia. Requesting revenue increase over 3 years to recover capital investments made during the 2018, '19, and planned investments over the '20 to '22 time period. The request provides the necessary framework to allow Pepco to align it's a system investments with policy goals aside by the commission and enable us to continue to make in the investments needed to modernize the energy great, support that district energy goals, sustain first quartile reliability performance and enhance programs and tools that have resulted in improved satisfaction among our customers. The multi-year plan includes 5 performance incentive mechanisms or PIMs, focused on the system reliability, customer service and interconnection of distributed energy resources. The inclusion of the PIMs will them year plan provide a performance-based ratemaking approach designed to strengthen in general incentives for grid utility performance and penalize underperformance. The multi-year plan a provides customers with rate predictability and reduce administrative costs to customers caused by filing a traditional rate cases recover costs. 
On July 9, the chief public utility law judge issued in his proposed order in the Pepco Maryland distribution rate case. The Chief Judge recommended a $10.3 million revenue increase and a 9.6% allowed ROE, which is 10 basis points higher than Pepco Maryland's current ROE. A final order by the Maryland PUC is expected by August 13. 
Finally, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 23 in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're continuing our robust capital deployment program at the utilities and during the second quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers. We expect to exceed our capital plan of $5.3 billion by $100 million this year. We have been able to take advantage of the favorable weather fund investments in our gas business at BG&E last we have some additional storm related work. As Chris mentioned, these investments are improving our infrastructure, increasing reliability and resiliency, which results in a better customer experience. Today are been talking about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved operations to our customers in D.C. and northern Illinois. 
The first project District of Columbia lying underground project or D.C. PLUG. The D.C. PLUG initiative is a $500 million multi-year partnership between the district of Department of Transportation and Pepco focused on the underground placement of more vulnerable distribution power lines. 
Over the course of the initiative, up to 30 feeders will be placed underground with 6 during the first base. The underground placement of these lines will make the electric distribution system more resilient and during the severe weather events reducing the duration and frequency of electric outages. 
The second project featured is the expansion of ComEd substation. This $48 million project installed a new distribution terminal and associated equipment, including an indoor switchgear building. 3-medium power transformers and 12 138 circuit breakers. The expanded substation provides capacity to power the equivalent of 45,000 Ohms. It will support 3 new data centers in the Pepco technology corridor near airport. These customers choose the Greater Chicago area after several years of discussions with ComEd's economic development team part of our continuing efforts to bring additional investment and jobs in northern Illinois.
On slide 12, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy Generation company. Before discussing the gross margin update, and want to spend a minute talking about the drop in the liquid forward comps during the second quarter, particularly in June. Prices in PJM in 2020 and 2021 declined sharply. around-the-clock power prices fell nearly $3 per megawatt hour or approximately $0.11 -- 11% in 2020 and approximately $2.40 per megawatt hour or close to 10% in 2021. 
PJM prices fell more than $4 per megawatt hour and approximately 13% to 14% in '20 and '21, respectively. 
Jim can cover in more detail during Q&A, but at high level we think the implants reflected some combination of the following: lower natural gas prices a mild start to summer that weighed on prices, which then cascaded out to the forward curve, which we have seen before. Some market anticipation of plants targeted for retirement looking less likely to retire and hedging activity likely including market participants, selling based on changes in the economic value of revenue put options sold or written to support newbuild power plants over the last few years dragging down projects.
Despite the mild weather and low price environment, 2019 total gross margin is to our last update. During the quarter, we expect executed $100 million in power new business and $50 million in nonpower new business. We are highly hedged for the rest of the year and well-balanced on our Generation to matching strategy. 
In 2020 and '21, our total gross margin is down $100 million and $250 million, respectively. Gross margin declined $550 million and $500 million, respectively, primarily due to lower energy crisis at PJM New York Zone A and PJM Mark-to-market of hedges were up of $500 million and $300 million, respectively, as our hedge position mitigated part of the impact of the price declines. 
We also executed $50 million of power new business in both 2020 and 2021. We continue to remain behind our hedging and added less than amount of hedges across our regions during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter at 10% to 13% behind in 2020 and 7% to 10% behind in '21 when considering cross commodity hedges. Our Generation Road matching strategy remains a competitive advantage contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring the Generation outage to market discipline. We remain comfortable with the strategy to hold open market given the continued strength of our balance sheet. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 13, we remain committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and our investment Even at the June 30 pricing marks, given the levers we have available, we are confident that we will stay within our consolidated a photo take metrics in our disclosure window 2019 to 2022. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our target ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be 2.5x debt to EBITDA and 2x on a 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks."

In the meantime we are encompassing usually, committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations meeting our financial commitments effectively deploy more than $5 billion and capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. 
Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. We continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash flow from the Genco to fund incremental equity needs of utilities, pay down date and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, like we are doing with the TMI and selling assets where it makes sense to accelerating our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Generation to load match strategy Constellation. We will sustain strong investment credit metrics and will grow our dividend annually 5% through 2020. The strategy and our pain value proposition is effective.

At our disposal, and I would speculate on what at this time, but we obviously have the opportunity if necessary to look at asset sales. We do have a small amount of Roth Capital in our business.

Greg, there are a number of we are focused on clean energy legislation in Illinois.

So on that question, we have folks in environmental community heavily focusing on environmental justice, players of renewable developers are very focused on addressing both flaws in the prior version of the states clean energy targets to make sure that can achieve the goals that have been set previously, but also as I said, in more ambitious no target of renewable development in the state. The Consumer Advocate is heavily focused on this policy as well because the question of state having to pay twice for capacity very much in the forefront and ensuring that if we're going to incentivize clean energy, we can count that capacity towards our obligations at PJM.

So we've seen a pickup in crisis so far. I think when it comes to what we are working on, we talked over last several quarters on the market reform side our pricing is willing to be enacted there's some work being done on reserves and scarcity in pricing and the ORDC in PJM and our long-run it's a little bit lower priority right now for PJM, but the focus on the baseload price reform mission and a relaxation. Those are some of the things. I think there are -- we have new builds and retirements happening over the next 4 or 5 years as natural force of business and our fundamental analysis. So there will be a little bit of that, but I think by and large, the reforms are around price formation and then in the longer run, if you are able to come up with a market solution to have carbon pricing in the market would be another thing in the longer that would be something we would all continue working on. 
The one thing that's interesting to me about where we see these prices in that $22 area in the Cal 21, Cal 22, Cal 23 that's trading downward quarter 2 just clear. Quarter 2 just clear $22.25 with very, very mild weather. So the entire car is trading very mild quarter just traded.

Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over the last 3 months. First, we continue to move forward on our utility regulatory strategy filing distribution rate cases at BGE, ComEd and Pepco D.C., reflecting our safety and reliability investments across those service territories. 
In D.C., we filed our first multi-year rate case. The plan provides a necessary framework to align Pepco's system investments with D.C. policy goals, including grid modernization and further improvements to customer service and reliability. Joe will discuss the details in his remarks. 
Second, last week, Pepco and other parties filed a settlement agreement at FERC for pep -- PECO, not Pepco, PECO's formula rate transmission rate. The settlement includes a 10.35% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis points ROE adder. PECO made the original filing in 2017, and we expect the final order from FERC in 2020. 
Third, in June, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report locking our performance and sustainability goals and priorities in addition, the Benchmarking Air Emissions report that found Exelon is the largest generator of zero emissions energy in the U.S., producing 12% of the nations clean energy. Also, that we have the lowest emissions rate, emitting at a rate that is 4x less than the next cleanest generator.
Fourth, the New Jersey PU -- BPU approved ZEC payments for the state nuclear units, including our interest in sale. We appreciate the state support for the carbon-free power produced by these units. 
Fifth, we were unable to get legislation done in Pennsylvania in time to reverse the decision to close TMI this fall. Since then, there have been continued discussions on a path forward for the remaining nuclear plants in the state, including consideration of placing a priceline carbon through the regional carbon trading. 
Sixth, we are also pleased the Trumph administration decided not to impose coders on uranium, which would have jeopardized the continued operation of commercial nuclear reactors in The United States. 
And finally, last week, FERC issued an order directing PJM not to run the capacity auction in August. We agree with FERC's decision to delay the auction until the rules are finalized. The delay provides PJM and the state policymakers time to adjust to the commission's changes.
Before I turn to the financial results, I also want to address 2 matters, we have raised with us recently. Firstly, we received a number of questions from investors about the impact on our business from the steep decline in power prices. The decline presents a considerable challenge for us, but as you know, our hedging disclosures are a point-in-time estimate. If you have seen them move up and down in the past, we need to be thoughtful and deliver about our response if these prices persist. And we have a variety of levers that we can pull and decisions we can make if this is the future of energy markets. We are pursuing a number of market reforms addressing the financial challenges, many of them are planned space. 
Against this backdrop, I can also, again, assure you that we will not operate unprofitable or negative free cash flow plants. You've seen us close money losing plants in the past and you should expect that discipline to continue if reforms are not inactive.
The bottom line is that fundamental market performs leaded the United States, if we want to lead the nations, their clean energy climate goals, maintain fuel security and reliable system, we need to sustain an increased electrification preserving a significant economic value through good paying jobs and property taxes. We'll continue to work at state level and the national level with FERC, the Congress and the administration to make this happen. 
Second, we have had -- or we've received numerous questions from our investors about our subpoena in Illinois from the U.S. Attorney's Office. We are cooperating fully and provided all -- are providing all information requested by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We simply can't comment further on the investigation, and we are not going to speculate on whether it may affect legislative effects in the Illinois this fall. What we do know about this fall session is there are a number of stakeholders who want to see clean energy legislation inactive. 
Illinois lacks behind other progressive states on clean energy policy. Passing the clean energy legislation is a priority for many stakeholders include -- in Illinois, including the Citizens Utility Board, labor the Clean Jobs Coalition and the Renewable Community. These stakeholders want to greatly expand their renewable penetration, so the state will be able to achieve the 100% clean energy target by 2030. Kathleen and her team are working with the stakeholders to help crack the legislation -- the legislative package and the inform members of general assembly on the benefits of this legislation. 
It's important to remember that while we are putting a real effort into preserving the value of the Generation clean, our focus remains on the utilities. The bulk of our capital investment in growing majority of our earnings are coming from the regulated business where we continue to see great opportunities to invest and grow to the benefit of our customers and communities. 
Now I'll turn to the financial results on Slide 5. We had a good quarter delivering earnings at midpoint range of our guidance. On GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per share versus $0.56 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $0.71 last year. Joe will cover these drivers in his remarks. 
Turning to Slide 6. Operational performance of the utility was mixed during the quarter. We continued to perform at top quartile levels across reliability and customer operations metrics, whereas safety performance has slipped. Safety is the highest priority and we are focused on ways to improve our safety culture and performance. Outage frequency and outage duration performance is in the top quartile for 3 of our 4 utilities, with ComEd performing in the top decile. 
On the customer operations aside, all of our utilities perform in top quartile for service level and call abandonment rate. Our relationship with our customers is improving due to the investments we are making to improve reliability and the customer experience. This can be seen in our customer satisfaction scores and in the recent J.D. Power electrical residential customer satisfaction ratings. 
BGE and PECO and ComEd achieved top decile performance in customer satisfaction index. We improved or maintained our rankings in the J.D. Power rankings, Delmarva ranked first in the East mid region -- or midsize region, the first Exelon utility to ever be ranked first. 
BGE and PECO maintained their first quartile performance in the East large segment and ComEd improved in its rankings to the second quartile. 
Generation performed well during the quarter and nuclear produced 38.8 terawatts hours of zero-emission electricity with a capacity factor of 95.1%. And Exelon power had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 99.7%, exceeding our plan in the wind and solar capture on -- the plan was plan 96%. or was -- the plan was 96%.
Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at utility and our hedge disclosures. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP",1681,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at utility and our hedge disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.39 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher than our plan, largely due to O&M timing of ComEd, BGE and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. This was partially offset by milder weather expected in the Philadelphia area, impacting PECO by about $0.01 per share. ExGen earned $0.21 per share behind our plan. This was a result of lower loaded volumes at constellation due to mild weather and the standard outage sale. These factors where, partially offset by favorable O&M, strong performance of our generation fleet and realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. 
We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. And for the third quarter, we are providing adjusted operating guidance -- earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
On Slide 8, we share our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.60 per share in the second quarter of this year with $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.14 per share compared with last year. The earnings growth is driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases and higher transmission revenues at ComEd and PHI relative to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO. Exchange earnings were down $0.13 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by higher ZEC revenue from the increasing New York ZEC prices and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program.
Moving to Slide 9, our utility ROEs remained strong and we continue to exceed our 9% to 10% earned ROE targets across the utilities. The consolidated PHI utility earned a 9.1% ROE for the trailing 12 months. Compared to last quarter, we had some help from the constructive distribution rate case settlement at ACE, Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, offset by equity infusions across PHI. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities maintained its strong 10.5% earned ROEs in the quarter. Importantly, consolidated ROEs across our utilities were 10.2%. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our utilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. On May 24, BGE filed for a combined $148 million rate increase in electric and gas distribution revenues. The requested rate increase includes $81 million and almost $68 million for electric and gas revenues, respectively, based on rate base of $5.4 billion and a requested ROE of 10.3%. The increase is primarily driven by the ongoing need for capital investments to maintain and modernize the electric and gas distribution system. It also reflects moving $15.8 million of revenues currently being recovered via the stride and electric reliability investment surcharges into rate base, we -- into base rates. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
On May 30, Pepco filed a multi-year appointment in the District of Columbia. Requesting a revenue increase over 3 years to recover capital investments made during the 2018, '19 period and planned investments over the 2020 to '22 time period. The request provides the necessary framework to allow Pepco to align it's system investments with policy goals set by the commission and enable us to continue to make the investments needed to modernize the energy grid, support the District's energy goals, sustain first current quartile reliability performance and enhance programs and tools that have resulted in improved satisfaction among our customers. The multi-year plan includes 5 performance incentive mechanisms or PIMs, focused on system reliability, customer service and interconnection of distribute -- distributed energy resources. The inclusion of the PIMs with the mulit-year plan provide a performance-based ratemaking approach designed to strengthen general incentives for grid utility performance and penalize for underperformance. The multi-year plan provides customers with rate predictability and reduces the administrative costs to customers caused by free for filing traditional rate cases to recover costs. 
On July 9, the chief public utility law judge issued in his proposed order in the Pepco Maryland distribution rate case. The Chief Judge recommended a $10.3 million revenue increase and a 9.6% allowed ROE, which is 10 basis points higher than Pepco Maryland's current ROE. A final order by the Maryland PUC is expected by August 13. 
Finally, ComEd annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 23 in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're continuing our robust capital deployment program at utilities and during the second quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers. We expect to exceed our capital plan of $5.3 billion by $100 million this year. We have been able to take advantage of the favorable weather to fund investments in our gas business at BGE plus we had some additional storm related work. As Chris mentioned, these investments are improving our infrastructure, increasing reliability and resiliency, which results in a better customer experience. Today, I've been talking about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved operations to our customers in D.C. and Northern Illinois. 
The first project is the District of Columbia lying underground project or DC PLUG. The DC PLUG initiative is a $500 million multi-year partnership between the Districts Department of Transportation and Pepco focused on the underground placement of more vulnerable distribution power lines. 
Over the course of the initiative, up to 30 feeders will be placed underground with 6 during the first base. The underground placement of these lines will make the electric distribution system more resilient during the severe weather events reducing the duration and frequency of electric outages. 
The second project featured is the expansion of ComEd Itasca Substation. This $48 million project installed a new distribution terminal and associated equipment, including an indoor switchgear building. 3-medium power transformers and 12 138 circuit breakers. The expanded substation provides capacity to power the equivalent of 45,000 Ohms. It will support 3 new data centers in the Itasca growth technology corridor near O'Hare airport. These customers choose the Greater Chicago area after several years of discussions with ComEd's economic development team part of our continuing efforts to bring additional investment and jobs in Northern Illinois.
On slide 12, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Before discussing the gross margin update, I'd want to spend a minute talking about the drop in the illiquid forward power curves during the second quarter, particularly in June. Prices in PJM in 2020 and 2021 declined sharply. Now we have around-the-clock power prices fell nearly $3 per megawatt hour or approximately $0.11 -- 11% in 2020 and approximately $2.40 per megawatt hour or close to 10% in 2021. 
PJM West Hub prices fell more than $4 per megawatt hour and approximately 13% to 14% in '20 and '21, respectively. 
Jim can cover in more detail during Q&A, but at a high level we think these declines reflected some combination of the following: lower natural gas prices a mild start to summer that weighed on prompt prices, which then cascaded out to the forward curve, which we have seen before. Some market anticipation of plants targeted for retirement looking less likely to retire and hedging activity likely including market participants, selling based on changes in the economic value of revenue put options sold or written to support newbuild power plants over the last few years dragging down process.
Despite the mild weather and low price environment, 2019 total gross margin is flat to our last update. During the quarter, we've executed $100 million in power new business and $50 million in nonpower new business. We are highly hedged for the rest of the year and well-balanced on our Generation to load matching strategy. 
In 2020 and '21, our total gross margin is down $100 million and $250 million, respectively. Both in gross margin declined $550 million and $500 million, respectively, primarily due to lower energy crisis at PJM West Hub, New York Zone A and PJM NiHub. Mark-to-market of hedges were up $500 million and $300 million, respectively, as our hedge position mitigated part of the impact of the price declines. 
We also executed $50 million of power new business in both 2020 and 2021. We continue to remain behind our ratable hedging from -- for the sectors and added less than a ratable amount of hedges across our regions during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter at 10% to 13% behind ratables in 2020 and 7% to 10% behind in '21 when considering cross commodity hedges. Our Generation to load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our Generation output to market in a disciplined manner. We remain comfortable with the strategy to hold open market length, given the continued strength of our balance sheet. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 13, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade affect ratings. Even at the June 30 pricing marks, given the levers we have available, we are confident that we will stay within our consolidated FFO to debt metrics in our disclosure window 2019 to 2022. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x on a lead course basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We are prepared to meet them head on and take thorough or thoughtful action if necessary. In the meantime, we are encompassing that the things, we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion and capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. 
Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. We continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash flow from the Genco to fund an incremental equity needs of the utilities, to pay down date and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, like we are doing with the TMI and selling assets where it makes sense to accelerating our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Generation to load match strategy constellation. We will sustain strong investment grade -- credit metrics and will grow our dividend annually 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinned this value proposition is effective. We remained committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earning your ongoing support of Exelon. Operator, we can now open the call up to questions."

At our disposal, and I won't speculate on what at this time, but we obviously have the opportunity if necessary to look at asset sales. We do have a small amount of growth capital in our ExGen business. We would look at that and I think how we'll look at that.

So I think, when you look at, if this is a point in time estimate or our financials, as you said we have seen in the markets move up or down.

As you know, a number of states across the country have already set with 100% clean energy targets and it's not just states like California and New York, it's across the country, and so Illinois is a lot of effort, just I'm making sure that Illinois, which is already the cleanest state in the country, has an equally aggressive target. 
So on that question, we have folks in the environmental community heavily focusing on environmental justice, players, the renewable developers are very focused on addressing both flaws in the prior version of the states clean energy targets to make sure that they can achieve the goals that have been set previously, but also as I said, in more ambitious new target of renewable development in the state. The Consumer Advocate is heavily focused on this policy as well because the question of state having to pay twice for capacity is very much in the forefront and ensuring that if we're going to incentivize clean energy, we can count that capacity towards our obligations at PJM. And then finally, the labor community, very focused on what these policies mean both for new construction and preservation of things in clean energy resources. So that's the coalition us focusing on putting the package together. There are a number of parties, who will come together in the end to help us communicate the message that Chris mentioned that, it is important for the state, but it's not going to be possible if we can't allow this research to allow its capacity in less worthy efforts is foundational in getting this policy done."

I'll start. I think from a market perspective, first of all the one thing we -- I want to highlight to Joe's point about this at this point in time, we're already seeing the NiHub market move up $1 on the forward curve since the end of the quarter and the West Hub markets moved about $0.75 since the June 30 pricing. So we've seen a pickup in prices so far. I think when it comes to what we are working on, we talked over last several quarters on the market reform side, that as our pricing is willing to be enacting -- enacted, there's some work being done on reserves in scarcity pricing, and the ORDC curve and PJM. And then in the long-run it's a little bit lower priority right now for PJM, but the focus on the baseload price formation and through a relaxation. Those are some of the things. I think there are -- we have new builds and retirements both happening over the next 4 or 5 years as natural force of business and our fundamental analysis. So there will be a little bit of that, but I think buy and large, the reforms are around price formation and then in the longer run, if we're able to come up with a market solution to have carbon pricing in the market would be another thing in the longer that would be something we would all continue working on. 
The one thing that's interesting to me about where we seen these prices in that $22 area in the NiHub, if you look at Cal 21, Cal 22, Cal 23 that's trading downward to quarter 2 just clear. The Quarter 2 NiHub just cleared $22.25 with a very, very mild weather. So the entire curve is trading where a very mild quarter just traded. So it's an interesting note to me and I've given some insight into why we think those prices on the forward curve have that -- have already responded slightly higher in the last couple of weeks."

Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over the last 3 months. First, we continue to move forward on our utility regulatory strategy, filing distribution rate cases at BGE, ComEd and Pepco D.C., reflecting our safety and reliability investments across those service territories. 
In D.C., we filed our first multi-year rate case. The plan provides a necessary framework to align Pepco's system investments with D.C. policy goals, including grid modernization and further improvements to customer service and reliability. Joe will discuss the details in his remarks. 
Second, last week, Pepco and other parties filed a settlement agreement at FERC for pep -- PECO, not Pepco, PECO's formula rate transmission rate. The settlement includes a 10.35% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis point ROE adder. PECO made the original filing in 2017, and we expect the final order from FERC in 2020. 
Third, in June, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report, marking our performance and sustainability goals and priorities, in addition the Benchmarking Air Emissions report that found Exelon is the largest generator of zero emissions energy in the U.S., producing 12% of the nation's clean energy. Also, that we have the lowest emissions rate, emitting at a rate that is 4x less than the next cleanest generator.
Fourth, the New Jersey PU -- BPU approved ZEC payments for the state nuclear units, including our interest in Salem. We appreciate the state support for the carbon-free power produced by these units. 
Fifth, we were unable to get legislation done in Pennsylvania in time to reverse the decision to close TMI this fall. Since then, there have been continued discussions on a path forward for the remaining nuclear plants in the state, including consideration of placing a price line carbon through the regional carbon trading. 
Sixth, we are also pleased the Trump administration decided not to impose quotas on uranium, which would have jeopardized the continued operation of commercial nuclear reactors in The United States. 
And finally, last week, FERC issued an order directing PJM not to run the capacity auction in August. We agree with FERC's decision to delay the auction until the rules are finalized. The delay provides PJM and the state policymakers time to adjust to the commission's changes.
Before I turn to the financial results, I also want to address 2 matters you have raised with us recently. Firstly, we received a number of questions from investors about the impact on our business from the steep decline in power prices. The decline presents a considerable challenge for us, but as you know, our hedging disclosures are a point-in-time estimate. If you have seen them move up and down in the past, we need to be thoughtful and deliberate about our response if these prices persist. And we have a variety of levers that we can pull and decisions we can make if this is the future of energy markets. We are pursuing a number of market reforms addressing the financial challenges, many of [ our planned space ].
Against this backdrop, I can also again assure you that we will not operate unprofitable or negative free cash flow plants. You've seen us close money-losing plants in the past and you should expect that discipline to continue if reforms are not inactive.
The bottom line is that fundamental market reforms are needed in the United States if we want to meet the nation's clean energy climate goals, maintain fuel security and reliable system, we need to sustain an increased electrification, preserving a significant economic value through good-paying jobs and property taxes. We'll continue to work at state level and the national level with FERC, the Congress and the administration to make this happen. 
Second, we have had -- or we've received numerous questions from our investors about the subpoena in Illinois from the U.S. Attorney's Office. We are cooperating fully and provided all -- are providing all information requested by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We simply can't comment further on the investigation, and we are not going to speculate on whether it may affect legislative efforts in the -- Illinois this fall. What we do know about this fall session is there are a number of stakeholders who want to see clean energy legislation enacted. 
Illinois lags behind other progressive states on clean energy policy. Passing the clean energy legislation is a priority for many stakeholders, include -- in Illinois, including the Citizens Utility Board, [ Labor ], the Clean Jobs Coalition and the Renewable Community. These stakeholders want to greatly expand their renewable penetration so the state will be able to achieve the 100% clean energy target by 2030. Kathleen and her team are working with the stakeholders to help crack the legislation -- the legislative package and the -- inform members of general assembly on the benefits of this legislation. 
It's important to remember that while we are putting a real effort into preserving the value of the generation fleet, our focus remains on the utilities. The bulk of our capital investment and growing majority of our earnings are coming from the regulated business where we continue to see great opportunities to invest and grow to the benefit of our customers and communities. 
Now I'll turn to the financial results on Slide 5. We had a good quarter delivering earnings at midpoint range of our guidance. On GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per share versus $0.56 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $0.71 last year. Joe will cover these drivers in his remarks. 
Turning to Slide 6. Operational performance of the utility was mixed during the quarter. We continued to perform at top quartile levels across reliability and customer operations metrics, whereas safety performance has slipped. Safety is the highest priority and we are focused on ways to improve our safety culture and performance. Outage frequency and outage duration performance is in the top quartile for 3 of our 4 utilities, with ComEd performing in the top decile. 
On the customer operations aside, all of our utilities perform in top quartile for service level and call abandonment rate. Our relationship with our customers is improving due to the investments we are making to improve reliability and the customer experience. This can be seen in our customer satisfaction scores and in the recent J.D. Power electrical -- residential customer satisfaction ratings. 
BGE and PECO and ComEd achieved top decile performance in customer satisfaction index. We improved or maintained our rankings in the J.D. Power rankings, Delmarva ranked first in the East mid region -- midsize region, the first Exelon utility to ever be ranked first. 
BGE and PECO maintained their first quartile performance in the East large segment and ComEd improved in its rankings to the second quartile. 
Generation performed well during the quarter and nuclear produced 38.8 terawatts hours of zero-emission electricity with a capacity factor of 95.1%. And Exelon power had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 99.7%, exceeding our plan in the wind and solar capture on -- the plan was plan 96% or was -- [ beat the ] plan was 96%.
Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at utility and our hedge disclosures. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP",1686,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at utility and our hedge disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. 
Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.39 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher than our plan, largely due to O&M timing of ComEd, BGE and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. This was partially offset by milder weather than expected in the Philadelphia area, impacting PECO by about $0.01 per share. ExGen earned $0.21 per share behind our plan. This was a result of lower load volumes at constellation due to mild weather and the extended outage at Salem. These factors were partially offset by favorable O&M, strong performance of our generation fleet and realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. 
We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. And for the third quarter, we are providing adjusted operating guidance -- earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
On Slide 8, we share our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.60 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up [indiscernible] per share compared with last year. The earnings growth is driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases and higher transmission revenues at ComEd and PHI relative to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO. Exchange earnings were down $0.13 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by higher ZEC revenue from the increasing New York ZEC prices and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program.
Moving to Slide 9, our utility ROEs remained strong and we continue to exceed our 9% to 10% earned ROE targets across the utilities. The consolidated PHI utility earned a 9.1% ROE for the trailing 12 months. Compared to last quarter, we had some help from the constructive distribution rate case settlement at ACE, Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, offset by equity infusions across PHI. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities maintained its strong 10.5% earned ROEs in the quarter. Importantly, consolidated ROEs across our utilities were 10.2%. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. On May 24, BGE filed for a combined $148 million rate increase in electric and gas distribution revenues. The requested rate increase includes $81 million and almost $68 million for electric and gas revenues, respectively, based on rate base of $5.4 billion and a requested ROE of 10.3%. The increase is primarily driven by the ongoing need for capital investments to maintain and modernize the electric and gas distribution system. It also reflects moving $15.8 million of revenues currently being recovered via the stride and electric reliability investment surcharges into rate base, we -- into base rates. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
On May 30, Pepco filed a multi-year plan in the District of Columbia, requesting a revenue increase over 3 years to recover capital investments made during the 2018, '19 period and planned investments over the 2020 to '22 time period. The request provides the necessary framework to allow Pepco to align its system investments with policy goals set by the commission and enable us to continue to make the investments needed to modernize the energy grid, support the District's energy goals, sustain first current quartile reliability performance and enhance programs and tools that have resulted in improved satisfaction among our customers. The multi-year plan includes 5 performance incentive mechanisms, or PIMs, focused on system reliability, customer service and interconnection of distribute -- distributed energy resources. The inclusion of the PIMs with the multi-year plan provide a performance-based ratemaking approach designed to strengthen general incentives for grid utility performance and penalize for underperformance. The multi-year plan provides customers with rate predictability and reduces the administrative costs to customers caused by frequent filing of traditional rate cases to recover costs. 
On July 9, the chief public utility law judge issued his proposed order in the Pepco Maryland distribution rate case. The Chief Judge recommended a $10.3 million revenue increase and a 9.6% allowed ROE, which is 10 basis points higher than Pepco Maryland's current ROE. A final order by the Maryland PUC is expected by August 13. 
Finally, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 23 in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're continuing our robust capital deployment program at utilities and during the second quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers. We expect to exceed our capital plan of $5.3 billion by $100 million this year. We have been able to take advantage of the favorable weather to fund investments in our gas business at BGE, plus we had some additional storm-related work. As Chris mentioned, these investments are improving our infrastructure, increasing reliability and resiliency, which results in a better customer experience. Today, I'd like to talk about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved operations to our customers in D.C. and Northern Illinois. 
The first project is the District of Columbia line undergrounding project or DC PLUG. The DC PLUG initiative is a $500 million multi-year partnership between the Districts Department of Transportation and Pepco focused on the underground placement of more vulnerable distribution power lines. 
Over the course of the initiative, up to 30 feeders will be placed underground, with 6 during the first phase. The underground placement of these lines will make the electric distribution system more resilient during severe weather events, reducing the duration and frequency of electric outages. 
The second project featured is the expansion of ComEd's Itasca Substation. This $48 million project installed a new distribution terminal and associated equipment, including an indoor switchgear building, 3 medium-power transformers and twelve 138 kV circuit breakers. The expanded substation provides capacity to power the equivalent of 45,000 ohms. It will support 3 new data centers in the Itasca [ outgrowth ] technology corridor near O'Hare airport. These customers choose the Greater Chicago area after several years of discussions with ComEd's economic development team, part of our continuing efforts to bring additional investment and jobs to Northern Illinois.
On slide 12, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Before discussing the gross margin update, I want to spend a minute talking about the drop in the illiquid forward power curves during the second quarter, particularly in June. Prices in PJM in 2020 and 2021 declined sharply. NiHub around-the-clock power prices fell nearly $3 per megawatt hour or approximately $0.11 -- 11% in 2020 and approximately $2.40 per megawatt hour or close to 10% in 2021. 
PJM West Hub prices fell more than $4 per megawatt hour and approximately 13% to 14% in '20 and '21, respectively. 
Jim can cover in more detail during Q&A, but at a high level we think these declines reflected some combination of the following: lower natural gas prices; a mild start to summer that weighed on prompt prices, which then cascaded out to the forward curve, which we have seen before; some market anticipation of plants targeted for retirement looking less likely to retire; and hedging activity likely including market participants selling based on changes in the economic value of revenue put options sold or written to support newbuild power plants over the last few years, driving down process.
Despite the mild weather and low price environment, 2019 total gross margin is flat to our last update. During the quarter, we executed $100 million in power new business and $50 million in non-power new business. We are highly hedged for the rest of the year and well-balanced on our Generation to load matching strategy. 
In 2020 and '21, our total gross margin is down $100 million and $250 million, respectively. Both in gross margin declined $550 million and $500 million, respectively, primarily due to lower energy prices at PJM West Hub, New York Zone A and PJM NiHub. Mark-to-market of hedges were up $500 million and $300 million, respectively, as our hedge position mitigated part of the impact of the price declines. 
We also executed $50 million of power new business in both 2020 and 2021. We continue to remain behind our ratable hedging from -- for the sectors and added less than a ratable amount of hedges across our regions during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter at 10% to 13% behind ratables in 2020 and 7% to 10% behind in '21 when considering cross commodity hedges. Our Generation to load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our Generation output to market in a disciplined manner. We remain comfortable with the strategy to hold open market length, given the continued strength of our balance sheet. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 13, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade [ credit ] ratings. Even at the June 30 pricing marks, given the levers we have available, we are confident that we will stay within our consolidated FFO to debt metrics in our disclosure window, 2019 to 2022. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x on a lead course basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We are prepared to meet them head on and take thorough or thoughtful action if necessary. In the meantime, we are accomplishing the things we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. 
Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. We continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash flow from the Genco to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, like we are doing with TMI; and selling assets where it makes sense to, accelerating our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Generation to load match strategy constellation.

Greg, there are a number stakeholders that are very focused on getting clean energy legislation enacted in Illinois.

Greg, there are a number stakeholders that are very focused on getting clean energy legislation enacted in Illinois. As you know, a number of states across the country have already set 100% clean energy targets. And it's not just states like California and New York, it's across the country. And so Illinois -- there's a lot of emphasis on making sure that Illinois, which is already the cleanest state in the country, has an equally aggressive target. 
So on that question, we have folks in the environmental community heavily focusing on environmental justice, players; the renewable developers are very focused on addressing both flaws in the prior version of the state's clean energy targets to make sure that they can achieve the goals that have been set previously; but also, as I said, set a more ambitious new target of renewable development in the state. The Consumer Advocate is heavily focused on this policy as well because the question of state having to pay twice for capacity is very much in the forefront and ensuring that if we're going to incentivize clean energy, we can count that capacity towards our obligations with PJM. And then finally, the labor community is very focused on what these policies mean both for new construction and preservation of things in clean energy resources. So that's the coalition that is focusing on putting the package together. There are a number of parties who will come together in the end to help communicate the message that Chris mentioned that this is important for the state, but it's not going to be possible if we can't allow those resources to count its capacity and that's why the FRR piece is foundational to getting this policy done."

I think from a market perspective, first of all the one thing we -- I want to highlight to Joe's point about this as a point in time, we're already seeing the NiHub market move up $1 on the forward curve since the end of the quarter and the West Hub markets moved about $0.75 since the June 30 pricing. So we've seen a pickup in prices so far. I think when it comes to what we are working on, we talked over last several quarters on the market reform side. Fast Start pricing is waiting to be enacting -- enacted. There's some work being done on reserves in scarcity pricing and the ORDC curve and PJM. And then in the long-run, it's a little bit lower priority right now for PJM, but the focus on the baseload price formation and through to a relaxation. Those are some of the things. I think there are -- we have new builds and retirements both happening over the next 4 or 5 years as natural force of business and our fundamental analysis. So there will be a little bit of that, but I think by and large, the reforms are around price formation and then in the long run, if we're able to come up with a market solution, to have carbon pricing in the market would be another thing in the long run that would be something we would all continue working on. 
The one thing that's interesting to me about where we've seen these prices in that $22 area in the NiHub, if you look out at Cal '21, Cal '22, Cal '23, that's trading down where the quarter 2 just cleared. Quarter 2 NiHub just cleared $22.25 with very, very mild weather. So the entire curve is trading where a very mild quarter just traded. So it's an interesting note to me and I think gives us some insight into why we think those prices on the forward curve have that -- have already responded slightly higher in the last couple of weeks."

Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over th",1229,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over the last 3 months. First, we continue to move forward on our utility regulatory strategy, filing distribution rate cases at BGE, ComEd and Pepco D.C., reflecting our safety and reliability investments across those service territories. 
In D.C., we filed our first multi-year rate case. The plan provides a necessary framework to align Pepco's system investments with D.C. policy goals, including grid modernization and further improvements to customer service and reliability. Joe will discuss the details in his remarks. 
Second, last week, Pepco and other parties filed a settlement agreement at FERC for pep -- PECO, not Pepco, PECO's formula rate transmission rate. The settlement includes a 10.35% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis point ROE adder. PECO made the original filing in 2017, and we expect the final order from FERC in 2020. 
Third, in June, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report, marking our performance and sustainability goals and priorities, in addition the Benchmarking Air Emissions report that found Exelon is the largest generator of zero emissions energy in the U.S., producing 12% of the nation's clean energy. Also, that we have the lowest emissions rate, emitting at a rate that is 4x less than the next cleanest generator.
Fourth, the New Jersey PU -- BPU approved ZEC payments for the state nuclear units, including our interest in Salem. We appreciate the state support for the carbon-free power produced by these units. 
Fifth, we were unable to get legislation done in Pennsylvania in time to reverse the decision to close TMI this fall. Since then, there have been continued discussions on a path forward for the remaining nuclear plants in the state, including consideration of placing a price line carbon through the regional carbon trading. 
Sixth, we are also pleased the Trump administration decided not to impose quotas on uranium, which would have jeopardized the continued operation of commercial nuclear reactors in The United States. 
And finally, last week, FERC issued an order directing PJM not to run the capacity auction in August. We agree with FERC's decision to delay the auction until the rules are finalized. The delay provides PJM and the state policymakers time to adjust to the commission's changes.
Before I turn to the financial results, I also want to address 2 matters you have raised with us recently. Firstly, we received a number of questions from investors about the impact on our business from the steep decline in power prices. The decline presents a considerable challenge for us, but as you know, our hedging disclosures are a point-in-time estimate. If you have seen them move up and down in the past, we need to be thoughtful and deliberate about our response if these prices persist. And we have a variety of levers that we can pull and decisions we can make if this is the future of energy markets. We are pursuing a number of market reforms addressing the financial challenges, many of [ our planned space ].
Against this backdrop, I can also again assure you that we will not operate unprofitable or negative free cash flow plants. You've seen us close money-losing plants in the past and you should expect that discipline to continue if reforms are not inactive.
The bottom line is that fundamental market reforms are needed in the United States if we want to meet the nation's clean energy climate goals, maintain fuel security and reliable system, we need to sustain an increased electrification, preserving a significant economic value through good-paying jobs and property taxes. We'll continue to work at state level and the national level with FERC, the Congress and the administration to make this happen. 
Second, we have had -- or we've received numerous questions from our investors about the subpoena in Illinois from the U.S. Attorney's Office. We are cooperating fully and provided all -- are providing all information requested by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We simply can't comment further on the investigation, and we are not going to speculate on whether it may affect legislative efforts in the -- Illinois this fall. What we do know about this fall session is there are a number of stakeholders who want to see clean energy legislation enacted. 
Illinois lags behind other progressive states on clean energy policy. Passing the clean energy legislation is a priority for many stakeholders, include -- in Illinois, including the Citizens Utility Board, [ Labor ], the Clean Jobs Coalition and the Renewable Community. These stakeholders want to greatly expand their renewable penetration so the state will be able to achieve the 100% clean energy target by 2030. Kathleen and her team are working with the stakeholders to help crack the legislation -- the legislative package and the -- inform members of general assembly on the benefits of this legislation. 
It's important to remember that while we are putting a real effort into preserving the value of the generation fleet, our focus remains on the utilities. The bulk of our capital investment and growing majority of our earnings are coming from the regulated business where we continue to see great opportunities to invest and grow to the benefit of our customers and communities. 
Now I'll turn to the financial results on Slide 5. We had a good quarter delivering earnings at midpoint range of our guidance. On GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per share versus $0.56 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $0.71 last year. Joe will cover these drivers in his remarks. 
Turning to Slide 6. Operational performance of the utility was mixed during the quarter. We continued to perform at top quartile levels across reliability and customer operations metrics, whereas safety performance has slipped. Safety is the highest priority and we are focused on ways to improve our safety culture and performance. Outage frequency and outage duration performance is in the top quartile for 3 of our 4 utilities, with ComEd performing in the top decile. 
On the customer operations aside, all of our utilities perform in top quartile for service level and call abandonment rate. Our relationship with our customers is improving due to the investments we are making to improve reliability and the customer experience. This can be seen in our customer satisfaction scores and in the recent J.D. Power electrical -- residential customer satisfaction ratings. 
BGE and PECO and ComEd achieved top decile performance in customer satisfaction index. We improved or maintained our rankings in the J.D. Power rankings, Delmarva ranked first in the East mid region -- midsize region, the first Exelon utility to ever be ranked first. BGE and PECO maintained their first quartile performance in the East large segment and ComEd improved in its rankings to the second quartile. 
Generation performed well during the quarter and nuclear produced 38.8 terawatts hours of zero-emission electricity with a capacity factor of 95.1%. And Exelon power had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 99.7%, exceeding our plan in the wind and solar capture on -- the plan was plan 96% or was -- [ beat the ] plan was 96%.
Now I'll turn it over to Joe."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at utility and our hedge disclosures. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP",1686,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at utility and our hedge disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.39 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher than our plan, largely due to O&M timing of ComEd, BGE and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. This was partially offset by milder weather than expected in the Philadelphia area, impacting PECO by about $0.01 per share. ExGen earned $0.21 per share behind our plan. This was a result of lower load volumes at constellation due to mild weather and the extended outage at Salem. These factors were partially offset by favorable O&M, strong performance of our generation fleet and realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. And for the third quarter, we are providing adjusted operating guidance -- earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
On Slide 8, we share our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.60 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up [indiscernible] per share compared with last year. The earnings growth is driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases and higher transmission revenues at ComEd and PHI relative to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO. Exchange earnings were down $0.13 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by higher ZEC revenue from the increasing New York ZEC prices and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program.
Moving to Slide 9, our utility ROEs remained strong and we continue to exceed our 9% to 10% earned ROE targets across the utilities. The consolidated PHI utility earned a 9.1% ROE for the trailing 12 months. Compared to last quarter, we had some help from the constructive distribution rate case settlement at ACE, Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, offset by equity infusions across PHI. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities maintained its strong 10.5% earned ROEs in the quarter. Importantly, consolidated ROEs across our utilities were 10.2%. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. On May 24, BGE filed for a combined $148 million rate increase in electric and gas distribution revenues. The requested rate increase includes $81 million and almost $68 million for electric and gas revenues, respectively, based on rate base of $5.4 billion and a requested ROE of 10.3%. The increase is primarily driven by the ongoing need for capital investments to maintain and modernize the electric and gas distribution system. It also reflects moving $15.8 million of revenues currently being recovered via the stride and electric reliability investment surcharges into rate base, we -- into base rates. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. 
On May 30, Pepco filed a multi-year plan in the District of Columbia, requesting a revenue increase over 3 years to recover capital investments made during the 2018, '19 period and planned investments over the 2020 to '22 time period. The request provides the necessary framework to allow Pepco to align its system investments with policy goals set by the commission and enable us to continue to make the investments needed to modernize the energy grid, support the District's energy goals, sustain first current quartile reliability performance and enhance programs and tools that have resulted in improved satisfaction among our customers. The multi-year plan includes 5 performance incentive mechanisms, or PIMs, focused on system reliability, customer service and interconnection of distribute -- distributed energy resources. The inclusion of the PIMs with the multi-year plan provide a performance-based ratemaking approach designed to strengthen general incentives for grid utility performance and penalize for underperformance. The multi-year plan provides customers with rate predictability and reduces the administrative costs to customers caused by frequent filing of traditional rate cases to recover costs. 
On July 9, the chief public utility law judge issued his proposed order in the Pepco Maryland distribution rate case. The Chief Judge recommended a $10.3 million revenue increase and a 9.6% allowed ROE, which is 10 basis points higher than Pepco Maryland's current ROE. A final order by the Maryland PUC is expected by August 13. Finally, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 23 in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're continuing our robust capital deployment program at utilities and during the second quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers. We expect to exceed our capital plan of $5.3 billion by $100 million this year. We have been able to take advantage of the favorable weather to fund investments in our gas business at BGE, plus we had some additional storm-related work. As Chris mentioned, these investments are improving our infrastructure, increasing reliability and resiliency, which results in a better customer experience. Today, I'd like to talk about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved operations to our customers in D.C. and Northern Illinois. 
The first project is the District of Columbia line undergrounding project or DC PLUG. The DC PLUG initiative is a $500 million multi-year partnership between the Districts Department of Transportation and Pepco focused on the underground placement of more vulnerable distribution power lines. 
Over the course of the initiative, up to 30 feeders will be placed underground, with 6 during the first phase. The underground placement of these lines will make the electric distribution system more resilient during severe weather events, reducing the duration and frequency of electric outages. 
The second project featured is the expansion of ComEd's Itasca Substation. This $48 million project installed a new distribution terminal and associated equipment, including an indoor switchgear building, 3 medium-power transformers and twelve 138 kV circuit breakers. The expanded substation provides capacity to power the equivalent of 45,000 ohms. It will support 3 new data centers in the Itasca [ outgrowth ] technology corridor near O'Hare airport. These customers choose the Greater Chicago area after several years of discussions with ComEd's economic development team, part of our continuing efforts to bring additional investment and jobs to Northern Illinois.
On slide 12, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Before discussing the gross margin update, I want to spend a minute talking about the drop in the illiquid forward power curves during the second quarter, particularly in June. Prices in PJM in 2020 and 2021 declined sharply. NiHub around-the-clock power prices fell nearly $3 per megawatt hour or approximately $0.11 -- 11% in 2020 and approximately $2.40 per megawatt hour or close to 10% in 2021. PJM West Hub prices fell more than $4 per megawatt hour and approximately 13% to 14% in '20 and '21, respectively. 
Jim can cover in more detail during Q&A, but at a high level we think these declines reflected some combination of the following: lower natural gas prices; a mild start to summer that weighed on prompt prices, which then cascaded out to the forward curve, which we have seen before; some market anticipation of plants targeted for retirement looking less likely to retire; and hedging activity likely including market participants selling based on changes in the economic value of revenue put options sold or written to support newbuild power plants over the last few years, driving down process.
Despite the mild weather and low price environment, 2019 total gross margin is flat to our last update. During the quarter, we executed $100 million in power new business and $50 million in non-power new business. We are highly hedged for the rest of the year and well-balanced on our Generation to load matching strategy. 
In 2020 and '21, our total gross margin is down $100 million and $250 million, respectively. Both in gross margin declined $550 million and $500 million, respectively, primarily due to lower energy prices at PJM West Hub, New York Zone A and PJM NiHub. Mark-to-market of hedges were up $500 million and $300 million, respectively, as our hedge position mitigated part of the impact of the price declines. 
We also executed $50 million of power new business in both 2020 and 2021. We continue to remain behind our ratable hedging from -- for the sectors and added less than a ratable amount of hedges across our regions during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter at 10% to 13% behind ratables in 2020 and 7% to 10% behind in '21 when considering cross commodity hedges. Our Generation to load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our Generation output to market in a disciplined manner. We remain comfortable with the strategy to hold open market length, given the continued strength of our balance sheet. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 13, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade [ credit ] ratings. Even at the June 30 pricing marks, given the levers we have available, we are confident that we will stay within our consolidated FFO to debt metrics in our disclosure window, 2019 to 2022. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x on a lead course basis. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We are prepared to meet them head on and take thorough or thoughtful action if necessary. In the meantime, we are accomplishing the things we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. 
Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. We continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash flow from the Genco to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, like we are doing with TMI; and selling assets where it makes sense to, accelerating our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Generation to load match strategy constellation. We will sustain strong investment grade credit metrics and will grow our dividend annually 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective.

Greg, there are a number stakeholders that are very focused on getting clean energy legislation enacted in Illinois. As you know, a number of states across the country have already set 100% clean energy targets. And it's not just states like California and New York, it's across the country. And so Illinois -- there's a lot of emphasis on making sure that Illinois, which is already the cleanest state in the country, has an equally aggressive target. 
So on that question, we have folks in the environmental community heavily focusing on environmental justice, players; the renewable developers are very focused on addressing both flaws in the prior version of the state's clean energy targets to make sure that they can achieve the goals that have been set previously; but also, as I said, set a more ambitious new target of renewable development in the state. The Consumer Advocate is heavily focused on this policy as well because the question of state having to pay twice for capacity is very much in the forefront and ensuring that if we're going to incentivize clean energy, we can count that capacity towards our obligations with PJM. And then finally, the labor community is very focused on what these policies mean both for new construction and preservation of things in clean energy resources. So that's the coalition that is focusing on putting the package together. There are a number of parties who will come together in the end to help communicate the message that Chris mentioned that this is important for the state, but it's not going to be possible if we can't allow those resources to count its capacity and that's why the FRR piece is foundational to getting this policy done."

I think from a market perspective, first of all the one thing we -- I want to highlight to Joe's point about this as a point in time, we're already seeing the NiHub market move up $1 on the forward curve since the end of the quarter and the West Hub markets moved about $0.75 since the June 30 pricing. So we've seen a pickup in prices so far. I think when it comes to what we are working on, we talked over last several quarters on the market reform side. Fast Start pricing is waiting to be enacting -- enacted. There's some work being done on reserves in scarcity pricing and the ORDC curve and PJM. And then in the long-run, it's a little bit lower priority right now for PJM, but the focus on the baseload price formation and through to a relaxation. Those are some of the things. I think there are -- we have new builds and retirements both happening over the next 4 or 5 years as natural force of business and our fundamental analysis. So there will be a little bit of that, but I think by and large, the reforms are around price formation and then in the long run, if we're able to come up with a market solution, to have carbon pricing in the market would be another thing in the long run that would be something we would all continue working on. 
The one thing that's interesting to me about where we've seen these prices in that $22 area in the NiHub, if you look out at Cal '21, Cal '22, Cal '23, that's trading down where the quarter 2 just cleared. Quarter 2 NiHub just cleared $22.25 with very, very mild weather. So the entire curve is trading where a very mild quarter just traded. So it's an interesting note to me and I think gives us some insight into why we think those prices on the forward curve have that -- have already responded slightly higher in the last couple of weeks."

We had a good quarter, delivering strong earnings, excellent customer service across our utilities, and our nuclear units ran at high levels of reliability. I'll turn to our regular reporting of our financial pe",1186,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter, delivering strong earnings, excellent customer service across our utilities, and our nuclear units ran at high levels of reliability. I'll turn to our regular reporting of our financial performance in a minute, but I first want to address a matter that I know is on all of our minds. We have been -- we have publicly reported, we have received 2 grand jury subpoenas, the subjects which are our lobbying practices in Illinois and the company's relationship with an Illinois State Senator. The subpoenas and the speculation about what's behind them have dominated the news about Exelon and ComEd. Given that the investigations are ongoing, we cannot discuss many details. But I'll tell you this: when we learned of these investigations, we pledged complete cooperation with the government, and that is the path we have taken. 
The company's outside lawyers are undertaking an exhaustive investigation of the facts relevant to the subpoenas. A special committee of the Board represented by its own outside counsel has also been formed and is being briefed on investigation. Exelon's outside lawyers are sharing the results of the investigation with the government on an ongoing basis. Their investigation is enabling us to determine what changes are necessary internally to ensure that going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards, not whether actions have been legal or not, but rather, which go beyond the ethical approach. We are keeping our eye on the ball by staying focused on the operational and the strategic path that has delivered the success. 
Now I'll turn to the regular report and answer any questions about that, I can, at the end of the call. 
Starting on Slide 5. We've had positive developments over the quarter. First, we were named Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row, with Exelon continuing to score in the top 20% of North American companies in all industries. Second, we launched a climate investment initiative to invest $20 million in start-ups in our service territories that are working on new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change -- mitigating climate change. Third, Pepco Maryland was granted a 9.6 allowed ROE in its most recent rate case. This is an improvement, and the results continue to -- through the enhancement in our reliability and customer service for our customers. Fourth, a Maryland PSC issued an order in the alternative ratemaking proceeding known as PC 51, allowing Maryland utilities to file a multiyear rate plan as soon as next year. Fifth, the New York Supreme Court rejected challenges to the New York ZEC program, removing the last remaining legal challenge in front of us. Sixth, the government wealth issued an executive order beginning the process for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, the regional greenhouse gas initiative. This will allow Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals while helping to preserve the state's remaining zero-carbon nuclear plants. Seventh, earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Governor Hogan in Maryland that will allow us to continue to operate Coning Dam and protect the long-term health of the Chesapeake Bay. Continued production of carbon-free energy from the dam is vital to support Governor Hogan's goal in generating 100% clean electricity in Maryland by 2040. Finally, we're announcing a new round of cost savings at ExGen, finding additional $100 million in savings. We continue to work hard at driving efficiencies and adapting to current market conditions. These savings will help ExGen navigate the depressed forwards, but will not be enough to overcome the financial challenges of some of our Illinois nuclear plants. 
I realize there has been some discussion on the potential impact of the investigation on the prospects of a clean energy legislation in Illinois. The need for clean energy legislation is bigger than just one stakeholder or one company. We are one part, but only one part of the ongoing discussion about the urgent need for legislation in Illinois. With the roadblocks -- excuse me, with the rollback of environmental regulations in Washington, states across the country are taking action to require emission reductions so they can benefit from clean energy economy that will result. This is true in Illinois, where many stakeholders and policymakers want to put Illinois on a path to 100% clean, drive -- and drive electrification of transportation to protect our communities. They believe the action is urgently needed in Illinois to ensure clean air, reliable service and affordable rates among consumers. 
Exelon nuclear plants are essential to achieving these goals. The 4 plants without ZECs avoid 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission, contribute $4.5 billion in state gross domestic product, pay $149 million in state taxes. And if they were to retire prematurely, Illinois customers -- our consumers will pay more than 43 -- $483 million more in electricity [indiscernible]. 
I should point out that the delays in enacting the legislation are in part linked to FERC's delay in issuing an order on PJM market capacity. This is due to the lack of quorum until the end of November, when Commissioner Glick completes his recusal period. And while the FERC delay is very frustrating, it does allow Illinois more time to enact and implement the legislation changes in time to protect the clean energy programs from negative treatment and PJM capacity auction. The delay in FERC order will push back the 2022 and '23 auction until at least late fall 2020. 
Spring passage of legislation will allow for Illinois Clean Energy procurement mechanism to be in place before the 2023-2024 capacity auction and potentially before the 2022-2023 auction as well. 
Moving to our financial results. We have had a strong quarter with earnings above our guidance. Our GAAP base -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.79 per share versus $0.76 per share last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.92 per share versus $0.88 per share last year. Joe will cover these details in his remarks. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Operational performance at the utilities was mixed this quarter. Each of our utilities performed well on customer operations side with mostly top-quartile performance. However, only ComEd performed in the first quartile in outage frequency and duration metrics. 
This year, the Mid-Atlantic -- in the Mid-Atlantic, we have seen significantly more storms and abnormally higher temperatures, which increased vegetation impacts. It caused them reliability-related issues. For instance, PHI had 27 minor storms in 2019 compared to 4 in 2018. These drove the lower reliability metrics for our Mid-Atlantic utilities. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt hours of zero-emission electricity, with a capacity factor of 95.5. Exelon power exceeded our plan and had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.5 and a wind and solar capture of 96.5. That said, we also had some outages in Texas during critical hours that were disappointing and caused us to miss out on some of the bigger opportunities in ERCOT. 
For now, I'll turn it over to Joe, and then we'll go to the questions after. Thank you."

I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guid",1982,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guidance and our cost management program. 
First, turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.92 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. The outperformance was driven by Exelon Utilities, which delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to guidance driven largely by O&M timing during the quarter and favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware. As a reminder, in total, we are approximately 70% decoupled across our utilities. 
ExGen earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by unplanned outages at owned and contracted assets in ERCOT, which unfortunately hit during periods of high prices. Although we had 1 of the top 10 hottest summers in 70 years in PJM and the third hottest September on record, we saw lower prices and volatility, which resulted in less ability to optimize our wholesale portfolio during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.92 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.04 per share higher than the third quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.01 per share compared with last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather and load at PECO. 
ExGen's earnings were up $0.03 per share compared with last year, benefiting from fewer planned nuclear outage days at our owned and operated plants and savings associated with our cost management programs. Higher ZEC revenues from the increase in New York ZEC pricing and the start of the new Jersey ZEC program in April 2019 also contributed to ExGen's year-over-year earnings growth. These were partially offset by lower capacity pricing primarily in PJM. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are narrowing our 2019 EPS guidance range to $3.05 to $3.20 a share from $3 to $3.30 per share. As you are aware, ComEd's ROEs tied to the 30-year treasury rate, which has declined about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year. Our updated guidance takes into account the slight degradation in earnings we are seeing from the decline in treasuries. We are delivering on our financial commitments and confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to exceed our consolidated 9% to 10% target, with a 10.1% trailing 12-month ROE. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities remained above 10% but dipped modestly last quarter primarily due to a BG&E equity infusion to support capital investment as well as declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. The decline in treasuries will continue to impact ComEd's ROE for the remainder of the year and going forward if they do not rebound. 
The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.4% ROE for the trailing 12 months, a 30 basis point increase from last quarter driven by higher distribution revenue from the constructive distribution rate order at both Pepco Maryland and the settlement at Atlantic City Electric. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, there were some important developments on the regulatory front outside of our rate cases. First, as Chris mentioned, in August, the Maryland PSE in its PC 51 proceeding found that alternative rate plans can be beneficial to both customers and utilities by reducing administrative costs caused by the frequent filing of traditional rate cases and providing customer rate predictivity. The order supports the implementation of multiyear rate plan of a 3-year duration and established a working group to develop the rules. We are actively participating in the group process. Once the commission issues its final order, Maryland utilities will be able to file a multiyear rate plan on a staggered basis consistent with the commission's order. 
Second, the DC Public Service Commission approved PepCo's D.C. notice of construction request for Phase 1 of the Capital grid project. It will strengthen the Capital area electric system to improve reliability and resiliency and help facilitate the district's climate commitments. This phase, including rebuilding 2 substations and constructing approximately 10 miles of 2 230 kV underground transmission lines. Phase 1 is scheduled for completion by 2026. 
On our current rate cases, Pepco Maryland received a final order on August 12. The Maryland Commission approved a $10.3 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Pepco's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%, a recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. Rates went into effect on August 13. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress. On October 23, the administrative law judge presiding over ComEd's annual formula rate case issued a proposed order. No additional adjustments to the revenue requirements were recommended. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on December 4 of this year. 
Last Friday, BGE filed a settlement agreement with the Maryland PSC. The settlement provides for an increase to BG&E's annual electric and natural gas distribution rate of $25 million and $54 million, respectively. We expect a final order by December of 2019. 
Finally, we received the procedural schedule in PepCo's D.C. multiyear plan with a final order expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are continuing on our robust capital deployment at the utilities, investing $1.3 billion of capital during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.9 billion in capital at the utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our consumers. We expect to deploy more than $5.4 billion this year, $100 million above our original plan. And as a reminder, 63% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. 
Today, I will talk about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in Maryland and New Jersey. The first project is the BGT Crossing Reliability initiative, which is a $232 million multiyear project to install a double circuit 230 kV overhead electric transmission line across the Patapsco River, replacing the 2.25-mile underground circuit. The circuits are a critical link in the electric system and are exhibiting symptoms of long-term failure and are approaching the end of their useful life. Key crossing will improve grid reliability by reducing risk of power outages caused by aging infrastructure and will support faster restoration of customer interruptions going forward. 
The second project is the Lewis Higbee Ontario rebuild project in Atlantic City. The $62 million projects include rebuilding 3 69 kV transmission lines, which are about 16.5 line miles long in total and replacing 295 existing wood structures with 225 new galvanized steel structures. This project resolves potential system performance and reliability issues, thereby improving reliability and resiliency to customers in the service area of Absec and Island. 
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company. Since the Constellation merger, we have delivered strong results in our wholesale business quarter after quarter even in an environment of declining power and natural gas prices as well as lower volatility. These market conditions, combined with reduced liquidity out on the curve, leads to less opportunity to optimize our wholesale portfolio compared to history. As a result, we are reducing our power new business target by $50 million in 2020 and '21, and our non-power new business target by $50 million in 2021. These new business target reductions are mostly offset by cost savings, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
I should also stress that these changes reflect our expectation for our wholesale optimization business. Our customer-facing Constellation businesses continue to perform very well, with sustained margin and success in delivering new products for our customers. 
Turning to the gross margin tables. We did benefit in the third quarter from higher forward prices, which you can see in the open gross margin line. These positives were offset by the lower wholesale business targets that I just discussed, which leaves total gross margin in 2020 and '21 flat. During the quarter, we hedged a more than ratable amount as prices modestly recovered from their late second quarter lows. Although we are still behind ratable overall, ending the quarter 5% to 8% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in '21, we're much closer to a ratable hedging amount. We continue to see upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices. 
Turning to Slide 14. Between 2015 and 2018, we have announced more than $900 million in cost savings, which does not include the synergies from our merger with PHI. These savings were primarily at Exelon Generation, with approximately 1/3 coming from our corporate services company. In addition to O&M savings, we have continued to find ways to reduce the capital intensity of our generation fleet and improve its cash flows. Since 2015, we have reduced ExGen's total annual capital expenditures from $3.5 billion to a projected $1.5 billion in 2022 while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Included in these reductions are the elimination of motion growth capital at ExGen except for Constellation's customer-facing solar business, $325 million of base CapEx savings and $675 million of savings from nuclear fuel. 
One of the key components of our value proposition is ExGen's ability to generate free cash flow, and we continue to look for ways to optimize its cash flow. Today, we are announcing additional $100 million in run rate, pretax cash savings in 2022. The $75 million is attributed to O&M reductions and $25 million in other P&L items, which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. I should point out that these savings reflect our current state, and we expect an opportunity for additional savings that will vary in amount depending on the future state of our challenged Illinois nuclear stations. 
We can find these savings due to the hard work of all of our employees to strive every day to run the company more efficiently while adhering to our commitments of safety, reliability and community stewardship. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x debt-to-EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. 
Before turning the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks, I want to set expectations for our fourth quarter disclosures. Given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois, which will shape the future of Exelon Generation and the fact that PJM will not have held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year before our call in February, we will not be providing some of our unusual disclosures, including the roll-forward of our hedge disclosures to 2022 and ExGen's updated 4-year free cash flow outlook. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 16. We are accomplishing things we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. 
We will continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use, as Joe mentioned, the free cash flow from Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we did with TMI and Oyster Creek, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation to load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics. We'll grow our dividend annually by 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earn your ongoing support of Exelon.

There's other costs that we would look at, some of the levers we have at hand. We'll continue to address CapEx, obviously, and any other asset financing. So there's a combination of factors here.

So for 2019, for example, the weighted average 30-year is down approximately 50 basis points. And you see that with our revised guidance. 
The 30-year treasury on the forward curve is down approximately 70 basis points versus 12 31. And I would say, though, that's one piece of the plan. The CapEx plan, as we said, only incorporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve reliability and the customer experience. We have seen through time that as we get closer to a given period, we find need for additional investment to continue to improve reliability and that customer experience, and we'll continue to work hard at that as moving forward."

There are 3 potential outcomes here. The agreement was scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party, ComEd or city, have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement or they could continue to negotiate. As I said, the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate. And if we're successful, we'll get a new agreement. If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations. And if we do not reach a resolution, it's not like we stop providing electric service to the city, but our fee schedule and our teachers will drop out of the franchise agreement and will be governed by the municipal code. That will add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down, quite obviously, our activities. 
If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution, then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution. So that's kind of the outline of it. 
And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context. Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talked about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best-in-class. As a result of the good policies, which we've advocated for 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero-carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. 
We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans. We are on track, as a result of all of this, to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. 4 out of 9 of our rate cases have been decreases under the Smart Grid law, including the [indiscernible] cases. 
Chris talked about the investigation, and certainly, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things right. And with some humility, I could lay claim to being one of the best-performing utilities in America. And I'd just add that for context and all of the things we're talking about today."

So just -- but I think those plants would have been losing a lot of money if you didn't get them. So I guess, maybe you could just give some color of kind of what what value really is at risk from this from an investor standpoint? Because it's just not clear that you've gotten a lot of value out of any legislation over this period."

We are tied to the 30-year, and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask, and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format, and that's what we've done. 
As for Clinton and Quad cities, it did save the plants. And it's more than just saving losing cash. We would have shut them down, and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to the state and the community, but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units. We're working on legislation that would either secure the other 4 sites in the state through the FRR process or we'll shut those plants down. 
So in a point in time with a low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that has not been the historical case. And going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low, what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that I understand the sentiment of your view or your question, but there's been a great deal of consistency that's happened in a great deal of ability to invest capital. 
It's more than just the ROE, right? We have been able to, through legislative terms, been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower of returns, but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money. So that's huge. 
If you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions, investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital."

And so we have discussed openly that there -- the 4 sites, are in the future at the current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient by what the state wants auction process at PJM and go into FRR. They're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings. So that's the situation now. 
I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet. We're continuing to evaluate these numbers. But I could tell you that some are more dire than others at this point. And we need to move forward with the legislation to prevent the loss for the state from an environmental perspective and from economic perspective."

We continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure, both from an O&M and capital investment perspective, of our Generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to do. 
I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities. You see how we continue to manage our balance sheet, and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated, free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation. And we will continue to work hard to do that as we continue to transform the Generation business. 
The last piece is, obviously, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks and with some of the questions, we announced this cost-cutting exercise in a business-as-usual state. Depending on the outcome of the legislation in Illinois, clearly, there's other elements to our business that would need to evolve under certain scenarios.

So I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures. That's an expectation of the value we're going to create, both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in markets. The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly, and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins and really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. 
What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets, which actually where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my viewpoint, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly. So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures, and that's the number that we're lowering based on this environment, where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy, adding more generation to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that, I think, is a less risk environment for the generation company."

That's the reality if something doesn't happen in the spring because PJM will run their auctions. And if there's lack of legislation or our ability to withhold the load and the generation from that auction, the expectation of clearing megawatts, you've seen the trend.

We had a good quarter, delivering strong earnings, excellent customer service across our utilities, and our nuclear units ran at high levels of reliability. 
I'll turn to our regular reporting of our financial performance in a minute, but I first want to address a matter that I know is on all of our minds. We have been -- we have publicly reported we have received 2 grand jury subpoenas, the subjects which are our lobbying practices in Illinois and the company's relationship with an Illinois State Senator. These subpoenas and the speculation about what's behind them have dominated the news about Exelon and ComEd. Given that the investigations are ongoing, we cannot discuss many details. But I'll tell you this: when we learned of these investigations, we pledged complete cooperation with the government, and that is the path we have taken. 
The company's outside lawyers are undertaking an exhaustive investigation of the facts relevant to the subpoenas. A special committee of the Board represented by its own outside counsel has also been formed and is being briefed on investigation. Exelon's outside lawyers are sharing the results of the investigation with the government on an ongoing basis. Their investigation is enabling us to determine what changes are necessary internally to ensure that going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards, not whether actions have been legal or not, but rather, which go beyond the ethical reproach. We are keeping our eye on the ball by staying focused on the operational and the strategic path that has delivered the success. 
Now I'll turn to the regular report and answer any questions about that, I can, at the end of the call. Starting on Slide 5. We've had positive developments over the quarter. First, we were named Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row, with Exelon continuing to score in the top 20% of North American companies in all industries. 
Second, we launched a climate investment initiative to invest $20 million in startups in our service territories that are working on new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change -- mitigating climate change. 
Third, Pepco Maryland was granted a 9.6 allowed ROE in its most recent rate case. This is an improvement, and the results continue to -- through the enhancement in our reliability and customer service for our customers. 
Fourth, the Maryland PSC issued an order in the alternative ratemaking proceeding known as PC 51, allowing Maryland utilities to file a multiyear rate plan as soon as next year. 
Fifth, the New York Supreme Court rejected challenges to the New York ZEC program, removing the last remaining legal challenge in front of us. 
Sixth, Governor Wolf issued an executive order beginning the process for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This will allow Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals while helping to preserve the state's remaining zero-carbon nuclear plants. 
Seventh, earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Governor Hogan in Maryland that will allow us to continue to operate Conowingo Dam and protect the long-term health in the Chesapeake Bay. Continued production of carbon-free energy from the dam is vital to support Governor Hogan's goal in generating 100% clean electricity in Maryland by 2040. 
Finally, we're announcing a new round of cost savings at ExGen finding additional $100 million in savings. We continue to work hard at driving efficiencies and adapting to our current market conditions. These savings will help ExGen navigate the depressed forwards, but will not be enough to overcome the financial challenges of some of our Illinois nuclear plants. 
I realize there has been some discussion on the potential impact of the investigation on the prospects of a clean energy legislation in Illinois. The need for clean energy legislation is bigger than just one stakeholder or one company. We are one part, but only one part of the ongoing discussion about the urgent need for legislation in Illinois. 
With the roadblocks -- excuse me, with the rollback of environmental regulations in Washington, states across the country are taking action to require emission reductions so they can benefit from clean energy economy that will result. This is true in Illinois, where many stakeholders and policymakers want to put Illinois on a path to 100% clean, drive -- and drive electrification of transportation to protect our communities. They believe the action is urgently needed in Illinois to ensure clean air, reliable service and affordable rates among consumers. 
Exelon nuclear plants are essential to achieving these goals. The 4 plants without ZECs avoid 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission, contribute $4.5 billion in state gross domestic product, pay $149 million in state taxes and if they were to retire prematurely, Illinois customers -- our consumers will pay more than 43 -- $483 million more in electricity imminently. 
I should point out that the delays in enacting the legislation are in part linked to FERC's delay in issuing an order on PJM market capacity. This is due to the lack of quorum until the end of November, when Commissioner Glick completes his recusal period. And while the FERC delay is very frustrating, it does allow Illinois more time to enact and implement the legislation changes in time to protect the clean energy programs from negative treatment and PJM capacity auction. The delay in FERC order will push back the 2022 and '23 auction until at least late fall 2020. 
Spring passage of legislation will allow for Illinois Clean Energy procurement mechanism to be in place before the 2023-2024 capacity auction and potentially, before the 2022-2023 auction as well. 
Moving to our financial results. We have had a strong quarter with earnings above our guidance. Our GAAP base -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.79 per share versus $0.76 per share last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.92 per share versus $0.88 per share last year. Joe will cover these details in his remarks. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Operational performance at the utilities was mixed this quarter. Each of our utilities performed well on customer operations side with mostly top-quartile performance. However, only ComEd performed in the first quartile in outage frequency and duration metrics. 
This year, the Mid-Atlantic -- in the Mid-Atlantic, we have seen significantly more storms and abnormally higher temperatures, which increased vegetation impacts. It caused them the reliability-related issues. For instance, PHI had 27 minor storms in 2019 compared to 4 in 2018. These drove the lower reliability metrics for our Mid-Atlantic utilities. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt hours of zero-emission electricity, with a capacity factor of 95.5. Exelon power exceeded our plan and had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.5 and a wind and solar capture of 96.5. That said, we also had some outages in Texas during critical hours that were disappointing and caused us to miss out on some of the bigger opportunities in ERCOT. 
For now, I'll turn it over to Joe, and then we'll go with the questions after. Thank you."

I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guid",1987,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guidance and our cost management program. 
First, turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.92 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. The outperformance was driven by Exelon Utilities, which delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to guidance driven largely by O&M timing during the quarter and favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware. As a reminder, in total, we are approximately 70% decoupled across our utilities. 
ExGen earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by unplanned outages at owned and contracted assets in ERCOT, which unfortunately hit during periods of high prices. Although we had one of the top 10 hottest summers in 70 years in PJM and the third hottest September on record, we saw lower prices and volatility, which resulted in less ability to optimize our wholesale portfolio during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.92 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.04 per share higher than the third quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.01 per share compared with last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather and load at PECO. 
ExGen's earnings were up $0.03 per share compared with last year, benefiting from fewer planned nuclear outage days at our owned and operated plants and savings associated with our cost management programs. Higher ZEC revenues from the increase in New York ZEC pricing and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program in April 2019 also contributed to ExGen's year-over-year earnings growth. These were partially offset by lower capacity pricing primarily in PJM. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are narrowing our 2019 EPS guidance range to $3.05 to $3.20 a share from $3 to $3.30 per share. As you are aware, ComEd's ROE is tied to the 30-year treasury rate, which has declined about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year. Our updated guidance takes into account the slight degradation in earnings we are seeing from the decline in treasuries. We are delivering on our financial commitments and confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to exceed our consolidated 9% to 10% target, with a 10.1% trailing 12-month ROE. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities remained above 10% but dipped modestly last quarter primarily due to a BG&E equity infusion to support capital investment as well as declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. The decline in treasuries will continue to impact ComEd's ROE for the remainder of the year and going forward if they do not rebound. 
The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.4% ROE for the trailing 12 months, a 30 basis point increase from last quarter driven by higher distribution revenue from the constructive distribution rate order at both Pepco Maryland and the settlement at Atlantic City Electric. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, there were some important developments on the regulatory front outside of our [ 4 ] rate cases. First, as Chris mentioned, in August, the Maryland PSC in its PC 51 proceeding found that alternative rate plans can be beneficial to both customers and utilities by reducing administrative costs caused by the frequent filing of traditional rate cases and providing customer rate [ predictability ]. The order supports the implementation of multiyear rate plan of a 3-year duration and established a working group to develop the rules. We are actively participating in the group process. Once the commission issues its final order, Maryland utilities will be able to file a multiyear rate plan on a staggered basis consistent with the commission's order. 
Second, the DC Public Service Commission approved PepCo's D.C. notice of construction request for Phase 1 of the Capital Grid Project. It will strengthen the Capital area electric system, improve reliability and resiliency and help facilitate the district's climate commitments; this phase, including rebuilding 2 substations and constructing approximately 10 miles of 2 230 kV underground transmission lines. Phase 1 is scheduled for completion by 2026. 
On our current rate cases, Pepco Maryland received a final order on August 12. The Maryland Commission approved a $10.3 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Pepco's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%, a recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. Rates went into effect on August 13. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress. On October 23, the administrative law judge presiding over ComEd's annual formula rate case issued a proposed order. No additional adjustments to the revenue requirements were recommended. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on December 4 of this year. 
Last Friday, BGE filed a settlement agreement with the Maryland PSC. The settlement provides for an increase to BG&E's annual electric and natural gas distribution rate of $25 million and $54 million, respectively. We expect a final order by December of 2019. 
Finally, we received the procedural schedule in PepCo's D.C. multiyear plan with a final order expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are continuing on our robust capital deployment at the utilities, investing $1.3 billion of capital during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.9 billion in capital at the utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our consumers. We expect to deploy more than $5.4 billion this year, $100 million above our original plan. And as a reminder, 63% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. 
Today, I will talk about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in Maryland and New Jersey. 
The first project is the BGE's Key Crossing Reliability Initiative, which is a $232 million multiyear project to install a double circuit 230 kV overhead electric transmission line across the Patapsco River, replacing the 2.25-mile underground circuit. 
The circuits are a critical link in the electric system and are exhibiting symptoms of long-term failure and are approaching the end of their useful life. Key crossing will improve grid reliability by reducing risk of power outages caused by aging infrastructure and will support faster restoration of customer interruptions going forward. 
The second project is the Lewis Higbee Ontario Rebuild Project in Atlantic City. The $62 million projects include rebuilding 3 69 kV transmission lines, which are about 16.5 line miles long in total and replacing 295 existing wood structures with 225 new galvanized steel structures. This project resolves potential system performance and reliability issues, thereby improving reliability and resiliency to customers in the service area of Absecon Island. 
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company. Since the Constellation merger, we have delivered strong results in our wholesale business quarter after quarter even in an environment of declining power and natural gas prices as well as lower volatility. These market conditions, combined with reduced liquidity out on the curve, leads to less opportunity to optimize our wholesale portfolio compared to history. As a result, we are reducing our power new business target by $50 million in 2020 and '21, and our non-power new business target by $50 million in 2021. These new business target reductions are mostly offset by cost savings, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
I should also stress that these changes reflect our expectation for our wholesale optimization business. Our customer-facing Constellation businesses continue to perform very well, with sustained margin and success in delivering new products for our customers. 
Turning to the gross margin tables. We did benefit in the third quarter from higher forward prices, which you can see in the open gross margin line. These positives were offset by the lower wholesale business targets that I just discussed, which leaves total gross margin in 2020 and '21 flat. 
During the quarter, we hedged a more than ratable amount as prices modestly recovered from their late second quarter lows. Although we are still behind a ratable overall, ending the quarter 5% to 8% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in '21, we're much closer to a ratable hedging amount. We continue to see upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices. 
Turning to Slide 14. Between 2015 and 2018, we have announced more than $900 million in cost savings, which does not include the synergies from our merger with PHI. These savings were primarily at Exelon Generation, with approximately 1/3 coming from our corporate services company. 
In addition to O&M savings, we have continued to find ways to reduce the capital intensity of our generation fleet and improve its cash flows. Since 2015, we have reduced ExGen's total annual capital expenditures from $3.5 billion to a projected $1.5 billion in 2022 while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Included in these reductions are the elimination of most growth capital at ExGen except for Constellation's customer-facing solar business, $325 million of base CapEx savings and $675 million of savings from nuclear fuel. 
One of the key components of our value proposition is ExGen's ability to generate free cash flow, and we continue to look for ways to optimize its cash flow. Today, we are announcing additional $100 million in run rate, pretax cash savings in 2022. $75 million is attributed to O&M reductions and $25 million is other P&L items, which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. 
I should point out that these savings reflect our current state, and we expect an opportunity for additional savings that will vary in amount depending on the future state of our challenged Illinois nuclear stations. 
We can find these savings due to the hard work of all of our employees who strive every day to run the company more efficiently while adhering to our commitments of safety, reliability and community stewardship. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. 
Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x debt-to-EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. 
Before turning the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks, I want to set expectations for our fourth quarter disclosures. Given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois, which will shape the future of Exelon Generation, and the fact that PJM will not have held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year before our call in February, we will not be providing some of our usual disclosures, including the roll-forward of our hedge disclosures to 2022 and ExGen's updated 4-year free cash flow outlook. 
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 16. We are accomplishing things we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. 
We will continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use, as Joe mentioned, the free cash flow from Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we did with TMI and Oyster Creek, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation-to-load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics. We'll grow our dividend annually by 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earn your ongoing support of Exelon.

There's other costs that we would look at. Some of the levers we have at hand will continue to address CapEx, obviously, and any other asset financing. So there's a combination of factors here.

So for 2019, for example, the weighted average 30-year is down approximately 50 basis points. And you see that with our revised guidance. The 30-year treasury on the forward curve is down approximately 70 basis points versus 12/31. 
I would say, though, that's one piece of the plan. The CapEx plan, as we said, only incorporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve reliability and the customer experience. We have seen through time that as we get closer to a given period, we find need for additional investment to continue to improve reliability and that customer experience, and we'll continue to work hard at that as we move forward."

Now obviously, there are other elements of the bills, both from the CJC, the Path to 100% and others, that there is not agreement about. And that's why it's going to take all stakeholders together to deliver a piece of legislation that will get the states to its clean energy goals in a way that's affordable. And we are committed, as Chris said, to working with all stakeholders to achieve that goal."

At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets forth the procedures for us to use city right-of-ways for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use th",607,"Julien, let me just start off explaining what the franchise agreement is. At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets forth the procedures for us to use city right-of-ways for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use their right-of-ways. So what I'm talking about here, the kind of granular things that are in the franchise agreement, is how many times could you open up a street to interconnect a new business, what the fees are for those operations, that kind of granular detail. 
We've been in negotiations with the city now for some time. There was a pause in those negotiations, while the mayor's race was being sorted out and her new team was put in place. I'm pleased with the progress we're making right now. 
There are 3 potential outcomes here. The agreement was scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party, ComEd or city, have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement, or they can continue to negotiate. As I said, the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate. And if we're successful, we'll get a new agreement. 
If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations. And if we do not reach a resolution, it's not like we stop providing electric service to the city, but our fee schedule and our [ saviors ] will drop out of the franchise agreement and we'll be governed by the municipal code. That will add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down, quite obviously, our activities. 
If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution, then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution. So that's kind of the outline of it. 
And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context. Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talked about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best-in-class. As a result of the good policies which we've advocated for, 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero-carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. 
We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans. We are on track, as a result of all of this, to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. Four out of 9 of our rate cases have been decreases under the smart grid law, including the [ last 2 ] cases. 
Chris talked about the investigation, and certainly, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things right, and with some humility, could lay claim to being one of the best-performing utilities in America. And I'd just add that for context in all of the things we're talking about today."

So just -- but I think those plants would have been losing a lot of money if you didn't get them. So I guess, maybe you could just give some color of kind of what value really is at risk from this from an investor standpoint, because it's just not clear that you've gotten a lot of value out of any legislation over this period."

We are tied to the 30-year, and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. 
When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask, and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format, and that's what we've done. 
As for Clinton and Quad Cities, it did save the plants. And it's more than just saving losing cash. We would have shut them down, and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to the state and the community, but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units. We're working on legislation that would either secure the other 4 sites in the state through the FRR process or we'll shut those plants down. 
So in a point of time with the low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that has not been the historical case. And going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low, what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that I understand the sentiment of your view or your question, but there's been a great deal of consistency that's happened and a great deal of ability to invest capital. 
It's more than just the ROE, right? We have been able to -- through legislative terms, been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower returns, but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money. So that's huge. 
If you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions, investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital."

So what we do evaluate is the current financial performance, the free cash flow and earnings and then the forward projected based off of the forward curves and look at the credit metrics and the balance sheet to see what's happening.
And so we have discussed openly that there -- the 4 sites, are in the future at the current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources, with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient, by what the state wants, auction process at PJM and go into FRR, they're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings. So that's the situation.
Now, I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet. We're continuing to evaluate these numbers. But I could tell you that some are more dire than others at this point. And we need to move forward with the legislation to prevent the loss for the state from an environmental perspective and from economic perspective."

We continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure, both from an O&M and capital investment perspective, of our Generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to do. 
I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities. You see how we continue to manage our balance sheet, and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated, free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation. And we will continue to work hard to do that as we continue to transform the Generation business. 
The last piece is, obviously, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks and with some of the questions, we announced this cost-cutting exercise in a business-as-usual state. Depending on the outcome of the legislation in Illinois, clearly, there's other elements to our business that would need to evolve under certain scenarios.

So I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures. That's an expectation of the value we're going to create, both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in markets. 
The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly, and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins and really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. 
What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets, which actually, where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my viewpoint, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly. So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures, and that's the number that we're lowering based on this environment, where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy adding more generation to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. 
So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that, I think, is a less risk environment for the Generation company."

But I'll tell you this: when we learned of these investigations, we pledged complete cooperation with the government, and that is the path we have taken. 
The company's outside lawyers are undertaking an exhaustive investigation of the facts relevant to the subpoenas. A special committee of the Board represented by its own outside counsel has also been formed and is being briefed on the investigation. Exelon's outside lawyers are sharing the results of the investigation with the government on an ongoing basis. Their investigation is enabling us to determine what changes are necessary internally to ensure that going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards, not whether actions have been legal or not, but rather, which go beyond the ethical reproach. We are keeping our eye on the ball by staying focused on the operational and the strategic path that has delivered the success. 
Now I'll turn to the regular report and answer any questions about that I can at the end of the call. Starting on Slide 5. We've had positive developments over the quarter. First, we were named Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row, with Exelon continuing to score in the top 20% of North American companies in all industries. 
Second, we launched a climate investment initiative to invest $20 million in startups in our service territories that are working on new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change -- mitigating climate change. 
Third, Pepco Maryland was granted a 9.6 allowed ROE in its most recent rate case. This is an improvement, and the results continue to -- through the enhancement in our reliability and customer service for our customers. 
Fourth, the Maryland PSC issued an order in the alternative ratemaking proceeding known as PC 51, allowing Maryland utilities to file a multiyear rate plan as soon as next year. 
Fifth, the New York Supreme Court rejected challenges to the New York ZEC program, removing the last remaining legal challenge in front of us. 
Sixth, Governor Wolf issued an executive order beginning the process for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This will allow Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals while helping to preserve the state's remaining zero-carbon nuclear plants. 
Seventh, earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Governor Hogan in Maryland that will allow us to continue to operate Conowingo Dam and protect the long-term health in the Chesapeake Bay. Continued production of carbon-free energy from the dam is vital to support Governor Hogan's goal in generating 100% clean electricity in Maryland by 2040. 
Finally, we're announcing a new round of cost savings at ExGen, finding additional $100 million in savings. We continue to work hard at driving efficiencies and adapting to our current market conditions. These savings will help ExGen navigate the depressed forwards, but will not be enough to overcome the financial challenges of some of our Illinois nuclear plants. 
I realize there has been some discussion on the potential impact of the investigation on the prospects of a clean energy legislation in Illinois. The need for clean energy legislation is bigger than just one stakeholder or one company. We are one part, but only one part of the ongoing discussion about the urgent need for legislation in Illinois. 
With the roadblocks -- excuse me, with the rollback of environmental regulations in Washington, states across the country are taking action to require emission reductions so they can benefit from clean energy economy that will result. This is true in Illinois, where many stakeholders and policymakers want to put Illinois on a path to 100% clean, drive -- and drive electrification of transportation to protect our communities. They believe the action is urgently needed in Illinois to ensure clean air, reliable service and affordable rates among Illinois consumers. 
Exelon nuclear plants are essential to achieving these goals. The 4 plants without ZECs avoid 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission, contribute $4.5 billion in state gross domestic product, pay $149 million in state taxes and if they were to retire prematurely, Illinois customers -- or consumers will pay more than 43 -- $483 million more in electricity annually. 
I should point out that the delays in enacting the legislation are in part linked to FERC's delay in issuing an order on PJM market capacity. This is due to the lack of quorum until the end of November, when Commissioner Glick completes his recusal period. And while the FERC delay is very frustrating, it does allow Illinois more time to enact and implement the legislation changes in time to protect the clean energy programs from the negative treatment and PJM capacity auction. The delay in FERC order will push back the 2022 and '23 auction until at least late fall of 2020. 
Spring passage of legislation will allow for Illinois Clean Energy procurement mechanism to be in place before the 2023-2024 capacity auction and potentially before the 2022-2023 auction as well. 
Moving to our financial results. We have had a strong quarter with earnings above our guidance. Our GAAP base -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.79 per share versus $0.76 per share last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.92 per share versus $0.88 per share last year. Joe will cover these details in his remarks. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Operational performance at the utilities was mixed this quarter. Each of our utilities performed well on customer operations side with mostly top-quartile performance. However, only ComEd performed in the first quartile in outage frequency and duration metrics. 
This year, the Mid-Atlantic -- in the Mid-Atlantic, we have seen significantly more storms and abnormally higher temperatures, which increased vegetation impacts it caused on the reliability-related issues. For instance, PHI had 27 minor storms in 2019 compared to 4 in 2018. These drove the lower reliability metrics for our Mid-Atlantic utilities. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt hours of zero-emission electricity, with a capacity factor of 95.5. Exelon power exceeded our plan and had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.5 and a wind and solar capture of 96.5. That said, we also had some outages in Texas during critical hours that were disappointing and caused us to miss out on some of the bigger opportunities in ERCOT. 
For now, I'll turn it over to Joe, and then we'll go with the questions after. Thank you."

I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guid",1982,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guidance and our cost management program. 
First, turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.92 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. The outperformance was driven by Exelon Utilities, which delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to guidance driven largely by O&M timing during the quarter and favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware. As a reminder, in total, we are approximately 70% decoupled across our utilities. 
ExGen earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by unplanned outages at owned and contracted assets in ERCOT, which unfortunately hit during periods of high prices. Although we had one of the top 10 hottest summers in 70 years in PJM and the third hottest September on record, we saw lower prices and volatility, which resulted in less ability to optimize our wholesale portfolio during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.92 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.04 per share higher than the third quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up  [$0.01] per share compared with last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather and load at PECO. 
ExGen's earnings were up $0.03 per share compared with last year, benefiting from fewer planned nuclear outage days at our owned and operated plants and savings associated with our cost management programs. Higher ZEC revenues from the increase in New York ZEC pricing and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program in April 2019 also contributed to ExGen's year-over-year earnings growth. These were partially offset by lower capacity pricing primarily in PJM. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are narrowing our 2019 EPS guidance range to $3.05 to $3.20 a share from $3 to $3.30 per share. As you are aware, ComEd's ROE is tied to the 30-year treasury rate, which has declined about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year. Our updated guidance takes into account the slight degradation in earnings we are seeing from the decline in treasuries. We are delivering on our financial commitments and confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to exceed our consolidated 9% to 10% target, with a 10.1% trailing 12-month ROE. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities remained above 10% but dipped modestly last quarter primarily due to a BG&E equity infusion to support capital investment as well as declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. The decline in treasuries will continue to impact ComEd's ROE for the remainder of the year and going forward if they do not rebound. 
The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.4% ROE for the trailing 12 months, a 30 basis point increase from last quarter driven by higher distribution revenue from the constructive distribution rate order at both Pepco Maryland and the settlement at Atlantic City Electric. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, there were some important developments on the regulatory front outside of our rate cases. First, as Chris mentioned, in August, the Maryland PSC in its PC 51 proceeding, found that alternative rate plans can be beneficial to both customers and utilities by reducing administrative costs caused by the frequent filing of traditional rate cases and providing customer rate predictability. The order supports the implementation of multiyear rate plan of a 3-year duration and established a working group to develop the rules. We are actively participating in the group process. Once the commission issues its final order, Maryland utilities will be able to file a multiyear rate plan on a staggered basis consistent with the commission's order. 
Second, the DC Public Service Commission approved PepCo's D.C. notice of construction request for Phase 1 of the Capital Grid Project. It will strengthen the Capital area electric system, improve reliability and resiliency and help facilitate the district's climate commitments; this phase, including rebuilding 2 substations and constructing approximately 10 miles of 2 230 kV underground transmission lines. Phase 1 is scheduled for completion by 2026. 
On our current rate cases, Pepco Maryland received a final order on August 12. The Maryland Commission approved a $10.3 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Pepco's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%, a recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. Rates went into effect on August 13. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress. On October 23, the administrative law judge presiding over ComEd's annual formula rate case issued a proposed order. No additional adjustments to the revenue requirements were recommended. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on December 4 of this year. 
Last Friday, BGE filed a settlement agreement with the Maryland PSC. The settlement provides for an increase to BG&E's annual electric and natural gas distribution rate of $25 million and $54 million, respectively. We expect a final order by December of 2019. 
Finally, we received the procedural schedule in PepCo's D.C. multiyear plan with a final order expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are continuing on our robust capital deployment at the utilities, investing $1.3 billion of capital during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.9 billion in capital at the utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our consumers. We expect to deploy more than $5.4 billion this year, $100 million above our original plan. And as a reminder, 63% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. 
Today, I will talk about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in Maryland and New Jersey. 
The first project is the BGE's Key Crossing Reliability Initiative, which is a $232 million multiyear project to install a double circuit 230 kV overhead electric transmission line across the Patapsco River, replacing the 2.25-mile underground circuit. 
The circuits are a critical link in the electric system and are exhibiting symptoms of long-term failure and are approaching the end of their useful life. Key crossing will improve grid reliability by reducing risk of power outages caused by aging infrastructure and will support faster restoration of customer interruptions going forward. 
The second project is the Lewis Higbee Ontario Rebuild Project in Atlantic City. The $62 million projects include rebuilding 3 69 kV transmission lines, which are about 16.5 line miles long in total and replacing 295 existing wood structures with 225 new galvanized steel structures. This project resolves potential system performance and reliability issues, thereby improving reliability and resiliency to customers in the service area of Absecon Island. 
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company. Since the Constellation merger, we have delivered strong results in our wholesale business quarter after quarter even in an environment of declining power and natural gas prices as well as lower volatility. These market conditions, combined with reduced liquidity out on the curve, leads to less opportunity to optimize our wholesale portfolio compared to history. As a result, we are reducing our power new business target by $50 million in 2020 and '21, and our non-power new business target by $50 million in 2021. These new business target reductions are mostly offset by cost savings, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
I should also stress that these changes reflect our expectation for our wholesale optimization business. Our customer-facing Constellation businesses continue to perform very well, with sustained margin and success in delivering new products for our customers. 
Turning to the gross margin tables. We did benefit in the third quarter from higher forward prices, which you can see in the open gross margin line. These positives were offset by the lower wholesale business targets that I just discussed, which leaves total gross margin in 2020 and '21 flat. 
During the quarter, we hedged a more than ratable amount as prices modestly recovered from their late second quarter lows. Although we are still behind a ratable overall, ending the quarter 5% to 8% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in '21, we're much closer to a ratable hedging amount. We continue to see upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices. 
Turning to Slide 14. Between 2015 and 2018, we have announced more than $900 million in cost savings, which does not include the synergies from our merger with PHI. These savings were primarily at Exelon Generation, with approximately 1/3 coming from our corporate services company. 
In addition to O&M savings, we have continued to find ways to reduce the capital intensity of our generation fleet and improve its cash flows. Since 2015, we have reduced ExGen's total annual capital expenditures from $3.5 billion to a projected $1.5 billion in 2022 while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Included in these reductions are the elimination of most growth capital at ExGen except for Constellation's customer-facing solar business, $325 million of base CapEx savings and $675 million of savings from nuclear fuel. 
One of the key components of our value proposition is ExGen's ability to generate free cash flow, and we continue to look for ways to optimize its cash flow. Today, we are announcing additional $100 million in run rate, pretax cash savings in 2022. $75 million is attributed to O&M reductions and $25 million is other P&L items, which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. 
I should point out that these savings reflect our current state, and we expect an opportunity for additional savings that will vary in amount depending on the future state of our challenged Illinois nuclear stations. 
We can find these savings due to the hard work of all of our employees who strive every day to run the company more efficiently while adhering to our commitments of safety, reliability and community stewardship. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. 
Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x debt-to-EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. 
Before turning the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks, I want to set expectations for our fourth quarter disclosures. Given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois, which will shape the future of Exelon Generation, and the fact that PJM will not have held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year before our call in February, we will not be providing some of our usual disclosures, including the roll-forward of our hedge disclosures to 2022 and ExGen's updated 4-year free cash flow outlook. 
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 16. We are accomplishing things we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. 
We will continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use, as Joe mentioned, the free cash flow from Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we did with TMI and Oyster Creek, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation-to-load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics. We'll grow our dividend annually by 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earn your ongoing support of Exelon.

There's other costs that we would look at. Some of the levers we have at hand will continue to address CapEx, obviously, and any other asset financing. So there's a combination of factors here.

We update once a year on our Q4 call and we -- and as it relates to Exelon Utilities, and we will expect to do that on the call in February. Having said that, we are seeing the impact of the lower ROEs at ComEd. Just for reference, every 50 basis point move up or down is about $0.03 of EPS. So for 2019, for example, the weighted average 30-year is down approximately 50 basis points. And you see that with our revised guidance. The 30-year treasury on the forward curve is down approximately 70 basis points versus 12/31. 
I would say, though, that's one piece of the plan. The CapEx plan, as we said, only incorporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve reliability and the customer experience. We have seen through time that as we get closer to a given period, we find need for additional investment to continue to improve reliability and that customer experience, and we'll continue to work hard at that as we move forward."

And when you talk about the Clean Job Coalition, just so you know, that's not a very structured organization and to speak as a body, as somebody did to one publication, we're still very close in conversation with some of those members of the coalition, and we'll continue. But there's a lot of people involved. There's different coalitions. There's the Path to 100%, there's the Clean Job Coalition, there's the labor. So things are continuing to evolve in conversations with leadership in the legislature are continuing to take place. So it's not like we're stalled, stopped or don't have parties to deal with. 
Kathleen is dealing for the Generation side, doing a significant part of that. And Joe is working to not only support what the governor wants and what the state wants, but in the meantime, also protecting the consumers to make sure what we're doing to get to the path to 100% clean by 2030 is done in the most economic fashion. 
I'll ask Kathleen if she wants to add anything more to the first part, and then I'm going to turn it over to Joe."

If we do not address this, the PJM market will spend over $1 billion a year to old coal plants rather than investing the money towards the state's clean energy ambition. And the fact that folks are lobbying and rallying the capital around this, the fact that it's an important policy change and that it needs to happen right away is something that should be noted. 
Now obviously, there are other elements of the bills, both from the CJC, the Path to 100% and others, that there is not agreement about. And that's why it's going to take all stakeholders together to deliver a piece of legislation that will get the states to its clean energy goals in a way that's affordable. And we are committed, as Chris said, to working with all stakeholders to achieve that goal."

At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets forth the procedures for us to use city right-of-ways for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use th",605,"Julien, let me just start off explaining what the franchise agreement is. At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets forth the procedures for us to use city right-of-ways for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use their right-of-ways. So what I'm talking about here, the kind of granular things that are in the franchise agreement, is how many times could you open up a street to interconnect a new business, what the fees are for those operations, that kind of granular detail. 
We've been in negotiations with the city now for some time. There was a pause in those negotiations, while the mayor's race was being sorted out and her new team was put in place. I'm pleased with the progress we're making right now. 
There are 3 potential outcomes here. The agreement was scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party, ComEd or city, have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement, or they can continue to negotiate. As I said, the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate. And if we're successful, we'll get a new agreement. 
If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations. And if we do not reach a resolution, it's not like we stop providing electric service to the city, but our fee schedule and our procedures will drop out of the franchise agreement and we'll be governed by the municipal code. That will add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down, quite obviously, our activities. 
If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution, then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution. So that's kind of the outline of it. 
And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context. Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talked about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best-in-class. As a result of the good policies which we've advocated for, 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero-carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. 
We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans. We are on track, as a result of all of this, to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. Four out of 9 of our rate cases have been decreases under the smart grid law, including the [ last 2 ] cases. 
Chris talked about the investigation, and certainly, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things right, and with some humility, could lay claim to being one of the best-performing utilities in America. And I'd just add that for context in all of the things we're talking about today."

So just -- but I think those plants would have been losing a lot of money if you didn't get them. So I guess, maybe you could just give some color of kind of what value really is at risk from this from an investor standpoint, because it's just not clear that you've gotten a lot of value out of any legislation over this period."

We are tied to the 30-year, and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. 
When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask, and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format, and that's what we've done. 
As for Clinton and Quad Cities, it did save the plants. And it's more than just saving losing cash. We would have shut them down, and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to the state and the community, but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units. We're working on legislation that would either secure the other 4 sites in the state through the FRR process or we'll shut those plants down. 
So in a point of time with the low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that has not been the historical case. And going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low, what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that I understand the sentiment of your view or your question, but there's been a great deal of consistency that's happened and a great deal of ability to invest capital. 
It's more than just the ROE, right? We have been able to -- through legislative terms, been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower returns, but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money. So that's huge. 
If you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions, investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital."

So what we do evaluate is the current financial performance, the free cash flow and earnings and then the forward projected based off of the forward curves and look at the credit metrics and the balance sheet to see what's happening.
And so we have discussed openly that there -- the 4 sites, are in the future at the current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources, with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient, by what the state wants, auction process at PJM and go into FRR, they're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings. So that's the situation.
Now, I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet. We're continuing to evaluate these numbers. But I could tell you that some are more dire than others at this point. And we need to move forward with the legislation to prevent the loss for the state from an environmental perspective and from economic perspective."

We continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure, both from an O&M and capital investment perspective, of our Generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to do. 
I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities. You see how we continue to manage our balance sheet, and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated, free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation. And we will continue to work hard to do that as we continue to transform the Generation business.

So I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures. That's an expectation of the value we're going to create, both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in markets. 
The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly, and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins and really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. 
What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets, which actually, where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my viewpoint, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly. So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures, and that's the number that we're lowering based on this environment, where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy adding more generation to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. 
So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that, I think, is a less risk environment for the Generation company."

We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. 
The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. 
Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. 
I'll turn the call over to Mr. Chris Crane, Exelon's Chief Executive Officer."

We had a good quarter, delivering strong earnings, excellent customer service across our utilities, and our nuclear units ran at high levels of reliability. 
I'll turn to our regular reporting of our financial performance in a minute, but I first want to address a matter that I know is on all of our minds. We have been -- we have publicly reported we have received 2 grand jury subpoenas, the subjects which are our lobbying practices in Illinois and the company's relationship with an Illinois State Senator. These subpoenas and the speculation about what's behind them have dominated the news about Exelon and ComEd. Given that the investigations are ongoing, we cannot discuss many details. But I'll tell you this: when we learned of these investigations, we pledged complete cooperation with the government, and that is the path we have taken. 
The company's outside lawyers are undertaking an exhaustive investigation of the facts relevant to the subpoenas. A special committee of the Board represented by its own outside counsel has also been formed and is being briefed on the investigation. Exelon's outside lawyers are sharing the results of the investigation with the government on an ongoing basis. Their investigation is enabling us to determine what changes are necessary internally to ensure that going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards, not whether actions have been legal or not, but rather, which go beyond the ethical reproach. We are keeping our eye on the ball by staying focused on the operational and the strategic path that has delivered the success. 
Now I'll turn to the regular report and answer any questions about that I can at the end of the call. Starting on Slide 5. We've had positive developments over the quarter. First, we were named Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row, with Exelon continuing to score in the top 20% of North American companies in all industries. 
Second, we launched a climate investment initiative to invest $20 million in startups in our service territories that are working on new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change -- mitigating climate change. 
Third, Pepco Maryland was granted a 9.6 allowed ROE in its most recent rate case. This is an improvement, and the results continue to -- through the enhancement in our reliability and customer service for our customers. 
Fourth, the Maryland PSC issued an order in the alternative ratemaking proceeding known as PC 51, allowing Maryland utilities to file a multiyear rate plan as soon as next year. 
Fifth, the New York Supreme Court rejected challenges to the New York ZEC program, removing the last remaining legal challenge in front of us. 
Sixth, Governor Wolf issued an executive order beginning the process for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This will allow Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals while helping to preserve the state's remaining zero-carbon nuclear plants. 
Seventh, earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Governor Hogan in Maryland that will allow us to continue to operate Conowingo Dam and protect the long-term health in the Chesapeake Bay. Continued production of carbon-free energy from the dam is vital to support Governor Hogan's goal in generating 100% clean electricity in Maryland by 2040. 
Finally, we're announcing a new round of cost savings at ExGen, finding additional $100 million in savings. We continue to work hard at driving efficiencies and adapting to our current market conditions. These savings will help ExGen navigate the depressed forwards, but will not be enough to overcome the financial challenges of some of our Illinois nuclear plants. 
I realize there has been some discussion on the potential impact of the investigation on the prospects of a clean energy legislation in Illinois. The need for clean energy legislation is bigger than just one stakeholder or one company. We are one part, but only one part of the ongoing discussion about the urgent need for legislation in Illinois. 
With the roadblocks -- excuse me, with the rollback of environmental regulations in Washington, states across the country are taking action to require emission reductions so they can benefit from clean energy economy that will result. This is true in Illinois, where many stakeholders and policymakers want to put Illinois on a path to 100% clean, drive -- and drive electrification of transportation to protect our communities. They believe the action is urgently needed in Illinois to ensure clean air, reliable service and affordable rates among Illinois consumers. 
Exelon nuclear plants are essential to achieving these goals. The 4 plants without ZECs avoid 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission, contribute $4.5 billion in state gross domestic product, pay $149 million in state taxes and if they were to retire prematurely, Illinois customers -- or consumers will pay more than 43 -- $483 million more in electricity annually. 
I should point out that the delays in enacting the legislation are in part linked to FERC's delay in issuing an order on PJM market capacity. This is due to the lack of quorum until the end of November, when Commissioner Glick completes his recusal period. And while the FERC delay is very frustrating, it does allow Illinois more time to enact and implement the legislation changes in time to protect the clean energy programs from the negative treatment and PJM capacity auction. The delay in FERC order will push back the 2022 and '23 auction until at least late fall of 2020. 
Spring passage of legislation will allow for Illinois Clean Energy procurement mechanism to be in place before the 2023-2024 capacity auction and potentially before the 2022-2023 auction as well. 
Moving to our financial results. We have had a strong quarter with earnings above our guidance. Our GAAP base -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.79 per share versus $0.76 per share last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.92 per share versus $0.88 per share last year. Joe will cover these details in his remarks. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Operational performance at the utilities was mixed this quarter. Each of our utilities performed well on customer operations side with mostly top-quartile performance. However, only ComEd performed in the first quartile in outage frequency and duration metrics. 
This year, the Mid-Atlantic -- in the Mid-Atlantic, we have seen significantly more storms and abnormally higher temperatures, which increased vegetation impacts it caused on the reliability-related issues. For instance, PHI had 27 minor storms in 2019 compared to 4 in 2018. These drove the lower reliability metrics for our Mid-Atlantic utilities. 
Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt hours of zero-emission electricity, with a capacity factor of 95.5. Exelon power exceeded our plan and had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.5 and a wind and solar capture of 96.5. That said, we also had some outages in Texas during critical hours that were disappointing and caused us to miss out on some of the bigger opportunities in ERCOT. 
For now, I'll turn it over to Joe, and then we'll go with the questions after. Thank you."

Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guid",1982,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guidance and our cost management program. 
First, turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.92 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. The outperformance was driven by Exelon Utilities, which delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to guidance driven largely by O&M timing during the quarter and favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware. As a reminder, in total, we are approximately 70% decoupled across our utilities. 
ExGen earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by unplanned outages at owned and contracted assets in ERCOT, which unfortunately hit during periods of high prices. Although we had one of the top 10 hottest summers in 70 years in PJM and the third hottest September on record, we saw lower prices and volatility, which resulted in less ability to optimize our wholesale portfolio during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.92 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.04 per share higher than the third quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up [$0.01] per share compared with last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather and load at PECO. 
ExGen's earnings were up $0.03 per share compared with last year, benefiting from fewer planned nuclear outage days at our owned and operated plants and savings associated with our cost management programs. Higher ZEC revenues from the increase in New York ZEC pricing and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program in April 2019 also contributed to ExGen's year-over-year earnings growth. These were partially offset by lower capacity pricing primarily in PJM. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are narrowing our 2019 EPS guidance range to $3.05 to $3.20 a share from $3 to $3.30 per share. As you are aware, ComEd's ROE is tied to the 30-year treasury rate, which has declined about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year. Our updated guidance takes into account the slight degradation in earnings we are seeing from the decline in treasuries. We are delivering on our financial commitments and confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to exceed our consolidated 9% to 10% target, with a 10.1% trailing 12-month ROE. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities remained above 10% but dipped modestly last quarter primarily due to a BG&E equity infusion to support capital investment as well as declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. The decline in treasuries will continue to impact ComEd's ROE for the remainder of the year and going forward if they do not rebound. 
The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.4% ROE for the trailing 12 months, a 30 basis point increase from last quarter driven by higher distribution revenue from the constructive distribution rate order at both Pepco Maryland and the settlement at Atlantic City Electric. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, there were some important developments on the regulatory front outside of our rate cases. First, as Chris mentioned, in August, the Maryland PSC in its PC 51 proceeding, found that alternative rate plans can be beneficial to both customers and utilities by reducing administrative costs caused by the frequent filing of traditional rate cases and providing customer rate predictability. The order supports the implementation of multiyear rate plan of a 3-year duration and established a working group to develop the rules. We are actively participating in the group process. Once the commission issues its final order, Maryland utilities will be able to file a multiyear rate plan on a staggered basis consistent with the commission's order. 
Second, the DC Public Service Commission approved PepCo's D.C. notice of construction request for Phase 1 of the Capital Grid Project. It will strengthen the Capital area electric system, improve reliability and resiliency and help facilitate the district's climate commitments; this phase, including rebuilding 2 substations and constructing approximately 10 miles of 2 230 kV underground transmission lines. Phase 1 is scheduled for completion by 2026. 
On our current rate cases, Pepco Maryland received a final order on August 12. The Maryland Commission approved a $10.3 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Pepco's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%, a recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. Rates went into effect on August 13. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress. On October 23, the administrative law judge presiding over ComEd's annual formula rate case issued a proposed order. No additional adjustments to the revenue requirements were recommended. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on December 4 of this year. 
Last Friday, BGE filed a settlement agreement with the Maryland PSC. The settlement provides for an increase to BG&E's annual electric and natural gas distribution rate of $25 million and $54 million, respectively. We expect a final order by December of 2019. 
Finally, we received the procedural schedule in PepCo's D.C. multiyear plan with a final order expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are continuing on our robust capital deployment at the utilities, investing $1.3 billion of capital during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.9 billion in capital at the utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our consumers. We expect to deploy more than $5.4 billion this year, $100 million above our original plan. And as a reminder, 63% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. 
Today, I will talk about 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in Maryland and New Jersey. 
The first project is the BGE's Key Crossing Reliability Initiative, which is a $232 million multiyear project to install a double circuit 230 kV overhead electric transmission line across the Patapsco River, replacing the 2.25-mile underground circuit. 
The circuits are a critical link in the electric system and are exhibiting symptoms of long-term failure and are approaching the end of their useful life. Key crossing will improve grid reliability by reducing risk of power outages caused by aging infrastructure and will support faster restoration of customer interruptions going forward. 
The second project is the Lewis Higbee Ontario Rebuild Project in Atlantic City. The $62 million projects include rebuilding 3 69 kV transmission lines, which are about 16.5 line miles long in total and replacing 295 existing wood structures with 225 new galvanized steel structures. This project resolves potential system performance and reliability issues, thereby improving reliability and resiliency to customers in the service area of Absecon Island. 
On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company. Since the Constellation merger, we have delivered strong results in our wholesale business quarter after quarter even in an environment of declining power and natural gas prices as well as lower volatility. These market conditions, combined with reduced liquidity out on the curve, leads to less opportunity to optimize our wholesale portfolio compared to history. As a result, we are reducing our power new business target by $50 million in 2020 and '21, and our nonpower new business target by $50 million in 2021. These new business target reductions are mostly offset by cost savings, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
I should also stress that these changes reflect our expectation for our wholesale optimization business. Our customer-facing Constellation businesses continue to perform very well, with sustained margin and success in delivering new products for our customers. 
Turning to the gross margin tables. We did benefit in the third quarter from higher forward prices, which you can see in the open gross margin line. These positives were offset by the lower wholesale business targets that I just discussed, which leaves total gross margin in 2020 and '21 flat. 
During the quarter, we hedged a more than ratable amount as prices modestly recovered from their late second quarter lows. Although we are still behind a ratable overall, ending the quarter 5% to 8% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in '21, we're much closer to a ratable hedging amount. We continue to see upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices. 
Turning to Slide 14. Between 2015 and 2018, we have announced more than $900 million in cost savings, which does not include the synergies from our merger with PHI. These savings were primarily at Exelon Generation, with approximately 1/3 coming from our corporate services company. 
In addition to O&M savings, we have continued to find ways to reduce the capital intensity of our generation fleet and improve its cash flows. Since 2015, we have reduced ExGen's total annual capital expenditures from $3.5 billion to a projected $1.5 billion in 2022 while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Included in these reductions are the elimination of most growth capital at ExGen except for Constellation's customer-facing solar business, $325 million of base CapEx savings and $675 million of savings from nuclear fuel. 
One of the key components of our value proposition is ExGen's ability to generate free cash flow, and we continue to look for ways to optimize its cash flow. Today, we are announcing additional $100 million in run rate, pretax cash savings in 2022. $75 million is attributed to O&M reductions and $25 million is other P&L items, which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. 
I should point out that these savings reflect our current state, and we expect an opportunity for additional savings that will vary in amount depending on the future state of our challenged Illinois nuclear stations. 
We can find these savings due to the hard work of all of our employees who strive every day to run the company more efficiently while adhering to our commitments of safety, reliability and community stewardship. 
Finally, moving on to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. 
Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x debt-to-EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. 
Before turning the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks, I want to set expectations for our fourth quarter disclosures. Given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois, which will shape the future of Exelon Generation, and the fact that PJM will not have held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year before our call in February, we will not be providing some of our usual disclosures, including the roll-forward of our hedge disclosures to 2022 and ExGen's updated 4-year free cash flow outlook. 
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 16. We are accomplishing things we committed to do, including maintaining industry-leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one, and we are committed to our value proposition. 
We will continue to grow the utilities, targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use, as Joe mentioned, the free cash flow from Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we did with TMI and Oyster Creek, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation-to-load match strategy at Constellation. 
We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics. We'll grow our dividend annually by 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earn your ongoing support of Exelon.

And as it relates to ExGen, we announced these cost cuts, which mostly offset the reduction in the new business targets. As Chris mentioned, depending on the outcome of Illinois, there's still other things that we would have to evaluate on how our business model changes and disposition of assets. There's other costs that we would look at. Some of the levers we have at hand will continue to address CapEx, obviously, and any other asset financing. So there's a combination of factors here.

Having said that, we are seeing the impact of the lower ROEs at ComEd. Just for reference, every 50 basis point move up or down is about $0.03 of EPS. So for 2019, for example, the weighted average 30-year is down approximately 50 basis points. And you see that with our revised guidance. The 30-year treasury on the forward curve is down approximately 70 basis points versus 12/31. 
I would say, though, that's one piece of the plan. The CapEx plan, as we said, only incorporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve reliability and the customer experience. We have seen through time that as we get closer to a given period, we find need for additional investment to continue to improve reliability and that customer experience, and we'll continue to work hard at that as we move forward."

But there's a lot of people involved. There's different coalitions. There's the Path to 100%, there's the Clean Job Coalition, there's the labor. So things are continuing to evolve in conversations with leadership in the legislature are continuing to take place. So it's not like we're stalled, stopped or don't have parties to deal with. 
Kathleen is dealing for the Generation side, doing a significant part of that. And Joe is working to not only support what the governor wants and what the state wants, but in the meantime, also protecting the consumers to make sure what we're doing to get to the path to 100% clean by 2030 is done in the most economic fashion.

And the fact that folks are lobbying and rallying the capital around this, the fact that it's an important policy change and that it needs to happen right away is something that should be noted. 
Now obviously, there are other elements of the bills, both from the CJC, the Path to 100% and others, that there is not agreement about. And that's why it's going to take all stakeholders together to deliver a piece of legislation that will get the states to its clean energy goals in a way that's affordable.

At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets forth the procedures for us to use city right-of-ways for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use th",605,"Julien, let me just start off explaining what the franchise agreement is. At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets forth the procedures for us to use city right-of-ways for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use their right-of-ways. So what I'm talking about here, the kind of granular things that are in the franchise agreement, is how many times could you open up a street to interconnect a new business, what the fees are for those operations, that kind of granular detail. 
We've been in negotiations with the city now for some time. There was a pause in those negotiations, while the mayor's race was being sorted out and her new team was put in place. I'm pleased with the progress we're making right now. 
There are 3 potential outcomes here. The agreement was scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party, ComEd or city, have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement, or they can continue to negotiate. As I said, the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate. And if we're successful, we'll get a new agreement. 
If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations. And if we do not reach a resolution, it's not like we stop providing electric service to the city, but our fee schedule and our procedures will drop out of the franchise agreement and we'll be governed by the municipal code. That will add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down, quite obviously, our activities. 
If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution, then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution. So that's kind of the outline of it. 
And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context. Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talked about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best-in-class. As a result of the good policies which we've advocated for, 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero-carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. 
We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans. We are on track, as a result of all of this, to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. Four out of 9 of our rate cases have been decreases under the smart grid law, including the [ last 2 ] cases. 
Chris talked about the investigation, and certainly, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things right, and with some humility, could lay claim to being one of the best-performing utilities in America. And I'd just add that for context in all of the things we're talking about today."

We are tied to the 30-year, and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. 
When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask, and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format, and that's what we've done. 
As for Clinton and Quad Cities, it did save the plants. And it's more than just saving losing cash. We would have shut them down, and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to the state and the community, but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units. We're working on legislation that would either secure the other 4 sites in the state through the FRR process or we'll shut those plants down. 
So in a point of time with the low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that has not been the historical case. And going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low, what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that I understand the sentiment of your view or your question, but there's been a great deal of consistency that's happened and a great deal of ability to invest capital. 
It's more than just the ROE, right? We have been able to -- through legislative terms, been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower returns, but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money. So that's huge. 
If you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions, investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital."

So what we do evaluate is the current financial performance, the free cash flow and earnings and then the forward projected based off of the forward curves and look at the credit metrics and the balance sheet to see what's happening.
And so we have discussed openly that there -- the 4 sites, are in the future at the current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources, with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient, by what the state wants, auction process at PJM and go into FRR, they're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings. So that's the situation.
Now I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet. We're continuing to evaluate these numbers. But I could tell you that some are more dire than others at this point. And we need to move forward with the legislation to prevent the loss for the state from an environmental perspective and from economic perspective."

We continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure, both from an O&M and capital investment perspective, of our Generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to do. 
I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities. You see how we continue to manage our balance sheet, and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated, free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation.

So I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures. That's an expectation of the value we're going to create, both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in markets. 
The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly, and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins and really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. 
What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets, which actually, where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my viewpoint, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly. So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures, and that's the number that we're lowering based on this environment, where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy adding more generation to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. 
So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that, I think, is a less risk environment for the Generation company."
