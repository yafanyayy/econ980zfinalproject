Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range.

Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range. Constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2018 highlights and the year ahead. 
Our fleet performed well in 2018 generating station and other outstanding year carbon-free electricity production generating 31.1 million-megawatt hours of energy. It is also notable that the team of had already completed the scheduled 2018 spring refuelings and maintenance outage in 28 days and 13 hours. The shortest in Palo Verde history. 
Turning to our generation needs. In 2018, we issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 megawatts of battery storage to be located on up to 5 of our AZ Sun sites. Based upon our evaluation of the RFP responses, we expanded the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 megawatts by adding a 6 AZ Sun site, which is expected to be in service by mid-2020. This investment will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets, increases fuel savings for customers and further advances our clean energy portfolio goals. 
In addition, we have entered in the purchased power agreements for over 600 megawatts of peaking capacity resources beginning in 2021. These contracts are the result of our 2018 peaking capacity RFP and include a 150 megawatts of battery storage and 463-megawatt summer seasonal natural gas power purchase agreement. 
Looking forward, we will continue our efforts to meet future customer needs with clean technologies. To accomplish this, we plan to install at least 660 megawatts of APS-owned solar plus battery storage and stand-alone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025. We expect to procure the first 260 megawatts in 2019. Added to our government commitments, we expect to invest in a total of 950 megawatts of clean technology by 2025. 
In addition to our investment in generation resources needed to support customer growth, I'd like to highlight 2 other examples of capital investments benefiting customers. First, we installed an additional transformer near Four Corners, increasing our ability to meet the rising demand for wheeling services. The total project cost was $25 million invested from 2016 through 2018. We received $12 million in additional transmission revenue after placing the transformer in-service in 2018. 
Customers will benefit from lower rates going forward as a result of our increased ability to offer these services. The second investment is located in the West Valley. We continue to see new companies building out on the west side of Phoenix. To support this growth, we plan to invest $100 million to construct a new West Valley service center that is expected to be completed in 2022. 
Turning to the regulatory front, in January, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted to conduct a review of APS' 2018 books and records to determine whether the 2017 rate review order was implemented properly, and whether APS has earned more than its allowed rate of return. 
In our opinion, reviewing APS' 2018 books and records is a constructive way for the commission to complete its due diligence and gain confidence in the outcome of our last rate review. We appreciate the commission's commitment to understanding the facts and will be providing the commission staff with information they need to complete the review by the May 3rd deadline. 
We're confident the rate increase was implemented appropriately consistent with the rate review order. As Jim will discuss, our 2018 Arizona jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% return on equity.
The commission has also opened a docket to evaluate retail competition. In Arizona, there are numerous legal challenges, consumer issues and logistical challenges implementing retail competition. For example, implementation would require amendment to the Arizona Constitution. Given the challenges, we believe it will be very difficult to implement retail competition in Arizona as things stand today. However, there is always value in exploring different options and understanding the spectrum of possible opportunities. 
We appreciate the commission's interest in understanding the negative impacts retail competition has had on a residential customers in other states. 2 other important items in front of the commission are the Four Corners SCR step increase request and a request to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers. 
On November 27 of 2018, the administrative law judge issued a recommended opinion and order consistent with the commission staff's proposed $58.47 million revenue increase. We expect a decision on the SCR step increase request and the tax refund request in early 2019.
For our company, we believe 2019 will be a productive year with our strategic priorities centered around clean energy, affordability and reliability. We recognize that achieving success in our corporate strategic initiatives will only happen through our people. Putting our people first and prioritizing development has been at the forefront. I'm pleased to highlight the recent promotion of Jeff Guldner, previously our Executive Vice President of Public Policy, to his new position as President of APS. Jeff is a strong and thoughtful leader with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing our industry. I know that under his leadership, the company will be well positioned to meet the challenges presented by a growing Arizona and I look forward to working with Jeff to lead our company forward. In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2018 and are well positioned for 2019 in the long term. We have clear priorities and a strong leadership team in place to achieve our goals. We remain focused on creating value. Our core business, while delivering on our financial and operational commitments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the det",1202,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. 
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the details of our 2018 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors in the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4. 
For the fourth quarter of 2018, we are earned $0.23 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin was down $0.15 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher sales-related revenue and a change in residential rate design and seasonal rates we are more than offset by the unfavorable weather and the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rates shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve. Offsetting the decrease in adjusted gross margin were lower operating and maintenance expenses, higher pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits, other income and lower adjusted income tax expense. 
For the full year 2018, we delivered solid results with earnings at the upper end of our guidance range, earning $4.54 per share compared to $4.35 per share in 2017. Reflected in these results is an ACC jurisdictional ROE of 9.5. When we calculated the ACC jurisdictional ROE, excluded revenue related to FERC jurisdiction. 
FERC represents approximately 70% of rate base and has an authorized ROE of 10.75%. 
Turning your attention to Slide 5, I'll review some highlights of our full year results. Gross margin was a key driver during the year with a few core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.69 per share. However, increases in operating expenses offset a portion of the benefit the gross margin. Transmission revenue added $0.18 per share, due in part to the addition of new long-term leasing agreements. The LCFR added incremental growth at our gross margin at $0.02 per share, higher sales-related revenue added $0.16 per share gross margin 2018, driven by customer growth and higher average affected prices. 
Offsetting drivers included the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform and unfavorable weather. Looking next at operating expense, operations and maintenance expense was up in 2019 compared to 2017 decreasing earnings by $0.50 per share, primarily due to higher costs at APS planned outages, transmission and distribution and customer service cost, information technology and the parent level higher public average cost. 
Higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings $0.33 per share in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to the planned additions in the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2017 rate order. Other taxes were higher in 2018 relative to the 2017, reflecting higher property values and the impact of related to the amortization of our property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate order. 
Pension and other post-retirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $25 million or $0.17 per share in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was mainly related to higher market returns in 2017 and the adoption of new pension and OPEB accounting guidance in 2018. 
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was offset by a lower effective tax rate as illustrated in more detail on Slide 13. The net effect of adjusted net income, including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts offset by nondeductible costs and other items decreased earnings $0.08 per share.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. 
Now looking to Slide 6, Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. In 2018 Metro Phoenix increased 3.3% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. Construction employment increased by 11.5% in 2018. The manufacturing employment increased by 5.9%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 34,000 permits continuing the upward trend we have seen since the end of the recession. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1.7% for the entire year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
Switching to our financial activity, on December 21, Pinnacle West entered into a $150 million term loan facility that measures in December 2020. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
In 2019, we expect to issue up to $950 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $76 million in short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding. 
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 90% as of year-end 2018. This was largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy, which is mitigated risk to our benefit plan funding status. 
Turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook, as shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. We have extended our capital expenditures on rate base forecast through 2021 on slides 8, 9. We anticipate APS' capital investment to be around $1.5 billion in 2021 driven by investments in clean energy, infrastructure to support our customer growth and grid modernization. 
In closing, 2018 was another great year for Pinnacle West. We developed on excess top of our guidance range and increase our dividend for the seventh straight year. 2019 is off to a great start with the announcement of 950 megawatts of additional clean technology and growth in the West Valley. Our growth in clean energy investments are just a couple of examples supporting our long-term rate base growth outlook of 6% to 7%. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

296957,597872475,1665538,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2019",2019-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today.Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range, constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. J",980,"Thanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today.
Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range, constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2018 highlights and the year ahead. 
Our fleet performed well in 2018. Palo Verde Generating Station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 31.1 million megawatt hours of energy. It is also notable that the team at Palo Verde completed the scheduled 2018 spring refueling and maintenance outage in 28 days and 13 hours, the shortest in Palo Verde history.
Turning to our generation needs. In 2018, we issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 megawatts of battery storage to be located on up to 5 of our AZ Sun sites. Based upon our evaluation of the RFP responses, we expanded the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 megawatts by adding a sixth AZ Sun site, which is expected to be in service by mid-2020. This investment will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets, increases fuel savings for customers and further advances our clean energy portfolio goals.
In addition, we have entered into purchase power agreements for over 600 megawatts of peaking capacity resources beginning in 2021. These contracts are the result of our 2018 peaking capacity RFP and include 150 megawatts of battery storage and a 463-megawatt summer seasonal natural gas power purchase agreement.
Looking forward, we will continue our efforts to meet future customer needs with clean technologies. To accomplish this, we plan to install at least 660 megawatts of APS-owned solar plus battery storage and stand-alone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025. We expect to procure the first 260 megawatts in 2019. When added to our current commitments, we expect to invest in a total of 950 megawatts of clean technology by 2025.
In addition to our investment in generation resources needed to support customer growth, I'd like to highlight 2 other examples of capital investments benefiting customers. First, we installed an additional transformer near Four Corners, increasing our ability to meet rising demand for wheeling services. The total project cost was $25 million invested from 2016 through 2018. We received $12 million in additional transmission revenue after placing the transformer in service in 2018. Customers will benefit from lower rates going forward as a result of our increased ability to offer these services.
The second investment is located in the West Valley. We continue to see new companies building out on the west side of Phoenix. To support this growth, we plan to invest $100 million to construct a new West Valley service center that is expected to be completed in 2022.
Turning to the regulatory front, in January, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted to conduct a review of APS' 2018 books and records to determine whether the 2017 rate review order was implemented properly and whether APS has earned more than its allowed rate of return.
In our opinion, reviewing APS' 2018 books and records is a constructive way for the commission to complete its due diligence and gain confidence in the outcome of our last rate review. We appreciate the commission's commitment to understanding the facts, and we'll be providing the commission staff with the information they need to complete the review by the May 3 deadline.
We're confident the rate increase was implemented appropriately, consistent with the rate review order. As Jim will discuss, our 2018 Arizona jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% return on equity.
The commission has also opened a docket to evaluate retail competition. In Arizona, there are numerous legal challenges, consumer issues and logistical challenges with implementing retail competition. For example, implementation would require an amendment to the Arizona Constitution. Given the challenges, we believe it will be very difficult to implement retail competition in Arizona as things stand today. However, there is always value in exploring different options and understanding the spectrum of possible opportunities.
We appreciate the commission's interest in understanding the negative impacts retail competition has had on residential customers in other states. Two other important items in front of the commission are the Four Corners SCR step increase request and a request to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers.
On November 27 of 2018, the administrative law judge issued a recommended opinion and order consistent with the commission staff's proposed $58.47 million revenue increase. We expect a decision on the SCR step increase request and the tax refund request in early 2019.
For our company, we believe 2019 will be a productive year with our strategic priorities centered around clean energy, affordability and reliability. We recognize that achieving success in our corporate strategic initiatives will only happen through our people. Putting our people first and prioritizing development has been at the forefront. I'm pleased to highlight the recent promotion of Jeff Guldner, previously our Executive Vice President of Public Policy, to his new position as President of APS. Jeff is a strong and thoughtful leader with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing our industry. I know that under his leadership, the company will be well positioned to meet the challenges presented by a growing Arizona, and I look forward to working closely with Jeff to lead our company forward.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2018 and are well positioned for 2019 and the long term. We have clear priorities and a strong leadership team in place to achieve our goals. We remain focused on creating value, our core business, while delivering on our financial and operational commitments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the det",1207,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the details of our 2018 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4.
For the fourth quarter of 2018, we earned $0.23 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin was down $0.15 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher sales-related revenue and a change in residential rate design and seasonal rates were more than offset by the unfavorable weather and the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rates shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve. Offsetting the decrease in adjusted gross margin were lower operating and maintenance expenses, higher pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits, other income and lower adjusted income tax expense.
For the full year of 2018, we delivered solid results with earnings at the upper end of our guidance range, earning $4.54 per share compared to $4.35 per share in 2017. Reflected in these results is an ACC jurisdictional ROE of 9.5%. When we calculated the ACC jurisdictional ROE, we excluded revenue related to FERC jurisdiction. FERC represents approximately 17% of rate base and has an authorized ROE of 10.75%.
Turning your attention to Slide 5. I'll review some highlights of our full year results. Gross margin was a key driver during the year with a few core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.69 per share. However, increases in operating expenses offset a portion of the benefit to gross margin. Transmission revenue added $0.18 per share, due in part to the addition of new long-term billing agreements. The LFCR added incremental growth to our gross margin at $0.02 per share, higher sales-related revenue added $0.16 per share to gross margin in 2018, driven by customer growth and higher average effective prices. Offsetting drivers included the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform and unfavorable weather.
Looking next at operating expense. Operations and maintenance expense was up in 2018 compared to 2017, decreasing earnings by $0.50 per share, primarily due to higher costs at APS for planned outages, transmission and distribution and customer service cost, information technology and the parent-level higher public outreach costs.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings $0.33 per share in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2017 rate order. Other taxes were higher in 2018 relative to 2017, reflecting higher property values and the impact related to the amortization of our property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate order.
Pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $25 million or $0.17 per share in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns in 2017 and the adoption of new pension and OPEB accounting guidance in 2018.
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was offset by a lower effective tax rate as illustrated in more detail on Slide 13. The net effect of adjusted net income, including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts offset by nondeductible costs and other items decreased earnings $0.08 per share.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. 
Now looking to Slide 6, Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. In 2018, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.3% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. Construction employment increased by 11.5% in 2018 and manufacturing employment increased by 5.9%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post-recession trend. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits.
In 2019, we expect a total of 34,000 permits, continuing the upward trend we have seen since the end of the recession. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1.7% for the entire year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
Switching to our financial activity. On December 21, Pinnacle West entered into a $150 million term loan facility that matures in December 2020. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In 2019, we expect to issue up to $950 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $76 million in short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 90% as of year-end 2018. This was largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy, which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status.
Turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. We have extended our capital expenditures and rate base forecast through 2021 on slides 8 and 9. We anticipate APS' capital investment to be around $1.5 billion in 2021, driven by investments in clean energy, infrastructure to support our customer growth and grid modernization.
In closing, 2018 was another great year for Pinnacle West. We delivered earnings at the top of our guidance range and increased our dividend for the seventh straight year. 2019 is off to a great start with the announcement of 950 megawatts of additional clean technology and growth in the West Valley. Our growth in clean energy investments are just a couple of examples supporting our long-term rate base growth outlook of 6% to 7%. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Ji",980,"Thanks, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today.
Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range, constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2018 highlights and the year ahead. 
Our fleet performed well in 2018. Palo Verde Generating Station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 31.1 million megawatt hours of energy. It is also notable that the team at Palo Verde completed the scheduled 2018 spring refueling and maintenance outage in 28 days and 13 hours, the shortest in Palo Verde history.
Turning to our generation needs. In 2018, we issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 megawatts of battery storage to be located on up to 5 of our AZ Sun sites. Based upon our evaluation of the RFP responses, we expanded the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 megawatts by adding a sixth AZ Sun site, which is expected to be in service by mid-2020. This investment will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets, increases fuel savings for customers and further advances our clean energy portfolio goals.
In addition, we have entered into purchase power agreements for over 600 megawatts of peaking capacity resources beginning in 2021. These contracts are the result of our 2018 peaking capacity RFP and include 150 megawatts of battery storage and a 463-megawatt summer seasonal natural gas power purchase agreement.
Looking forward, we will continue our efforts to meet future customer needs with clean technologies. To accomplish this, we plan to install at least 660 megawatts of APS-owned solar plus battery storage and stand-alone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025. We expect to procure the first 260 megawatts in 2019. When added to our current commitments, we expect to invest in a total of 950 megawatts of clean technology by 2025.
In addition to our investment in generation resources needed to support customer growth, I'd like to highlight 2 other examples of capital investments benefiting customers. First, we installed an additional transformer near Four Corners, increasing our ability to meet rising demand for wheeling services. The total project cost was $25 million invested from 2016 through 2018. We received $12 million in additional transmission revenue after placing the transformer in service in 2018. Customers will benefit from lower rates going forward as a result of our increased ability to offer these services.
The second investment is located in the West Valley. We continue to see new companies building out on the west side of Phoenix. To support this growth, we plan to invest $100 million to construct a new West Valley service center that is expected to be completed in 2022.
Turning to the regulatory front, in January, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted to conduct a review of APS' 2018 books and records to determine whether the 2017 rate review order was implemented properly and whether APS has earned more than its allowed rate of return.
In our opinion, reviewing APS' 2018 books and records is a constructive way for the commission to complete its due diligence and gain confidence in the outcome of our last rate review. We appreciate the commission's commitment to understanding the facts, and we'll be providing the commission staff with the information they need to complete the review by the May 3 deadline.
We're confident the rate increase was implemented appropriately, consistent with the rate review order. As Jim will discuss, our 2018 Arizona jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% return on equity.
The commission has also opened a docket to evaluate retail competition. In Arizona, there are numerous legal challenges, consumer issues and logistical challenges with implementing retail competition. For example, implementation would require an amendment to the Arizona Constitution. Given the challenges, we believe it will be very difficult to implement retail competition in Arizona as things stand today. However, there is always value in exploring different options and understanding the spectrum of possible opportunities.
We appreciate the commission's interest in understanding the negative impacts retail competition has had on residential customers in other states. Two other important items in front of the commission are the Four Corners SCR step increase request and a request to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers.
On November 27 of 2018, the administrative law judge issued a recommended opinion and order consistent with the commission staff's proposed $58.47 million revenue increase. We expect a decision on the SCR step increase request and the tax refund request in early 2019.
For our company, we believe 2019 will be a productive year with our strategic priorities centered around clean energy, affordability and reliability. We recognize that achieving success in our corporate strategic initiatives will only happen through our people. Putting our people first and prioritizing development has been at the forefront. I'm pleased to highlight the recent promotion of Jeff Guldner, previously our Executive Vice President of Public Policy, to his new position as President of APS. Jeff is a strong and thoughtful leader with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing our industry. I know that under his leadership, the company will be well positioned to meet the challenges presented by a growing Arizona, and I look forward to working closely with Jeff to lead our company forward.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2018 and are well positioned for 2019 and the long term. We have clear priorities and a strong leadership team in place to achieve our goals. We remain focused on creating value, our core business, while delivering on our financial and operational commitments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the det",1206,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the details of our 2018 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4.
For the fourth quarter of 2018, we earned $0.23 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin was down $0.15 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher sales-related revenue and a change in residential rate design and seasonal rates were more than offset by the unfavorable weather and the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rates shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve. Offsetting the decrease in adjusted gross margin were lower operating and maintenance expenses, higher pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits, other income and lower adjusted income tax expense.
For the full year 2018, we delivered solid results with earnings at the upper end of our guidance range, earning $4.54 per share compared to $4.35 per share in 2017. Reflected in these results is an ACC jurisdictional ROE of 9.5%. When we calculated the ACC jurisdictional ROE, we excluded revenue related to FERC jurisdiction. FERC represents approximately 17% of rate base and has an authorized ROE of 10.75%.
Turning your attention to Slide 5. I'll review some highlights of our full year results. Gross margin was a key driver during the year with a few core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.69 per share. However, increases in operating expenses offset a portion of the benefit to gross margin. Transmission revenue added $0.18 per share, due in part to the addition of new long-term billing agreements. The LFCR added incremental growth to our gross margin at $0.02 per share, higher sales-related revenue added $0.16 per share to gross margin in 2018, driven by customer growth and higher average effective prices. Offsetting drivers included the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform and unfavorable weather.
Looking next at operating expense. Operations and maintenance expense was up in 2018 compared to 2017, decreasing earnings by $0.50 per share, primarily due to higher costs at APS for planned outages, transmission and distribution and customer service cost, information technology and the parent-level higher public outreach costs.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings $0.33 per share in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2017 rate order. Other taxes were higher in 2018 relative to 2017, reflecting higher property values and the impact related to the amortization of our property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate order.
Pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $25 million or $0.17 per share in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns in 2017 and the adoption of new pension and OPEB accounting guidance in 2018.
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was offset by a lower effective tax rate as illustrated in more detail on Slide 13. The net effect of adjusted net income, including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts offset by nondeductible costs and other items decreased earnings $0.08 per share.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. 
Now looking to Slide 6, Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. In 2018, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.3% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. Construction employment increased by 11.5% in 2018 and manufacturing employment increased by 5.9%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post-recession trend. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits.
In 2019, we expect a total of 34,000 permits, continuing the upward trend we have seen since the end of the recession. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1.7% for the entire year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
Switching to our financing activity. On December 21, Pinnacle West entered into a $150 million term loan facility that matures in December 2020. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In 2019, we expect to issue up to $950 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $76 million in short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 90% as of year-end 2018. This was largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy, which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status.
Turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. We have extended our capital expenditures and rate base forecast through 2021 on Slides 8 and 9. We anticipate APS' capital investment to be around $1.5 billion in 2021, driven by investments in clean energy, infrastructure to support our customer growth and grid modernization.
In closing, 2018 was another great year for Pinnacle West. We delivered earnings at the top of our guidance range and increased our dividend for the seventh straight year. 2019 is off to a great start with the announcement of 950 megawatts of additional clean technology and growth in the West Valley. Our growth in clean energy investments are just a couple of examples supporting our long-term rate base growth outlook of 6% to 7%. This concludes our prepared remarks.

Ji",980,"Thanks, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today.
Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range, constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2018 highlights and the year ahead. 
Our fleet performed well in 2018. Palo Verde Generating Station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 31.1 million megawatt hours of energy. It is also notable that the team at Palo Verde completed the scheduled 2018 spring refueling and maintenance outage in 28 days and 13 hours, the shortest in Palo Verde history.
Turning to our generation needs. In 2018, we issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 megawatts of battery storage to be located on up to 5 of our AZ Sun sites. Based upon our evaluation of the RFP responses, we expanded the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 megawatts by adding a sixth AZ Sun site, which is expected to be in service by mid-2020. This investment will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets, increases fuel savings for customers and further advances our clean energy portfolio goals.
In addition, we have entered into purchase power agreements for over 600 megawatts of peaking capacity resources beginning in 2021. These contracts are the result of our 2018 peaking capacity RFP and include 150 megawatts of battery storage and a 463-megawatt summer seasonal natural gas power purchase agreement.
Looking forward, we will continue our efforts to meet future customer needs with clean technologies. To accomplish this, we plan to install at least 660 megawatts of APS-owned solar plus battery storage and stand-alone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025. We expect to procure the first 260 megawatts in 2019. When added to our current commitments, we expect to invest in a total of 950 megawatts of clean technology by 2025.
In addition to our investment in generation resources needed to support customer growth, I'd like to highlight 2 other examples of capital investments benefiting customers. First, we installed an additional transformer near Four Corners, increasing our ability to meet rising demand for wheeling services. The total project cost was $25 million invested from 2016 through 2018. We received $12 million in additional transmission revenue after placing the transformer in service in 2018. Customers will benefit from lower rates going forward as a result of our increased ability to offer these services.
The second investment is located in the West Valley. We continue to see new companies building out on the west side of Phoenix. To support this growth, we plan to invest $100 million to construct a new West Valley service center that is expected to be completed in 2022.
Turning to the regulatory front, in January, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted to conduct a review of APS' 2018 books and records to determine whether the 2017 rate review order was implemented properly and whether APS has earned more than its allowed rate of return.
In our opinion, reviewing APS' 2018 books and records is a constructive way for the commission to complete its due diligence and gain confidence in the outcome of our last rate review. We appreciate the commission's commitment to understanding the facts, and we'll be providing the commission staff with the information they need to complete the review by the May 3 deadline.
We're confident the rate increase was implemented appropriately, consistent with the rate review order. As Jim will discuss, our 2018 Arizona jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% return on equity.
The commission has also opened a docket to evaluate retail competition. In Arizona, there are numerous legal challenges, consumer issues and logistical challenges with implementing retail competition. For example, implementation would require an amendment to the Arizona Constitution. Given the challenges, we believe it will be very difficult to implement retail competition in Arizona as things stand today. However, there is always value in exploring different options and understanding the spectrum of possible opportunities.
We appreciate the commission's interest in understanding the negative impacts retail competition has had on residential customers in other states. Two other important items in front of the commission are the Four Corners SCR step increase request and a request to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers.
On November 27 of 2018, the administrative law judge issued a recommended opinion and order consistent with the commission staff's proposed $58.47 million revenue increase. We expect a decision on the SCR step increase request and the tax refund request in early 2019.
For our company, we believe 2019 will be a productive year with our strategic priorities centered around clean energy, affordability and reliability. We recognize that achieving success in our corporate strategic initiatives will only happen through our people. Putting our people first and prioritizing development has been at the forefront. I'm pleased to highlight the recent promotion of Jeff Guldner, previously our Executive Vice President of Public Policy, to his new position as President of APS. Jeff is a strong and thoughtful leader with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing our industry. I know that under his leadership, the company will be well positioned to meet the challenges presented by a growing Arizona, and I look forward to working closely with Jeff to lead our company forward.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2018 and are well positioned for 2019 and the long term. We have clear priorities and a strong leadership team in place to achieve our goals. We remain focused on creating value, our core business, while delivering on our financial and operational commitments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the det",1206,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a successful year. Before I review the details of our 2018 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter, which can be found on Slide 4.
For the fourth quarter of 2018, we earned $0.23 per share compared to $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin was down $0.15 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher sales-related revenue and a change in residential rate design and seasonal rates were more than offset by the unfavorable weather and the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rates shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve. Offsetting the decrease in adjusted gross margin were lower operating and maintenance expenses, higher pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits, other income and lower adjusted income tax expense.
For the full year 2018, we delivered solid results with earnings at the upper end of our guidance range, earning $4.54 per share compared to $4.35 per share in 2017. Reflected in these results is an ACC jurisdictional ROE of 9.5%. When we calculated the ACC jurisdictional ROE, we excluded revenue related to FERC jurisdiction. FERC represents approximately 17% of rate base and has an authorized ROE of 10.75%.
Turning your attention to Slide 5. I'll review some highlights of our full year results. Gross margin was a key driver during the year with a few core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.69 per share. However, increases in operating expenses offset a portion of the benefit to gross margin. Transmission revenue added $0.18 per share, due in part to the addition of new long-term billing agreements. The LFCR added incremental growth to our gross margin at $0.02 per share, higher sales-related revenue added $0.16 per share to gross margin in 2018, driven by customer growth and higher average effective prices. Offsetting drivers included the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform and unfavorable weather.
Looking next at operating expense. Operations and maintenance expense was up in 2018 compared to 2017, decreasing earnings by $0.50 per share, primarily due to higher costs at APS for planned outages, transmission and distribution and customer service cost, information technology and the parent-level higher public outreach costs.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings $0.33 per share in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2017 rate order. Other taxes were higher in 2018 relative to 2017, reflecting higher property values and the impact related to the amortization of our property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate order.
Pension and other post-retirement benefits nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $25 million or $0.17 per share in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns in 2017 and the adoption of new pension and OPEB accounting guidance in 2018.
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was offset by a lower effective tax rate as illustrated in more detail on Slide 13. The net effect of adjusted net income, including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts offset by nondeductible costs and other items decreased earnings $0.08 per share.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. 
Now looking to Slide 6, Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. In 2018, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.3% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. Construction employment increased by 11.5% in 2018 and manufacturing employment increased by 5.9%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post-recession trend. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits.
In 2019, we expect a total of 34,000 permits, continuing the upward trend we have seen since the end of the recession. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1.7% for the entire year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
Switching to our financing activity. On December 21, Pinnacle West entered into a $150 million term loan facility that matures in December 2020. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In 2019, we expect to issue up to $950 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $76 million in short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 90% as of year-end 2018. This was largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy, which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status.
Turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. We have extended our capital expenditures and rate base forecast through 2021 on Slides 8 and 9. We anticipate APS' capital investment to be around $1.5 billion in 2021, driven by investments in clean energy, infrastructure to support our customer growth and grid modernization.
In closing, 2018 was another great year for Pinnacle West. We delivered earnings at the top of our guidance range and increased our dividend for the seventh straight year. 2019 is off to a great start with the announcement of 950 megawatts of additional clean technology and growth in the West Valley. Our growth in clean energy investments are just a couple of examples supporting our long-term rate base growth outlook of 6% to 7%. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
On April 9, chief administrative law judge, Jane Rodarte, issued a recommended opinion and order or rule as we call it in the customer complaint docket. The rule states that the customer complaint should be dismissed. The rule also recommends that in the next rate review, APS, commission staff and other stakeholders collaborate on better ways to communicate the bill impacts to residential customers. 
The rule suggests that any further issues consuming the reason wellness of APS's rates are the adequacy of this customer education and outreach program be considered in the current rate review docket. 
The current rate review docket was opened by the commission in January to review APS's 2018 books and records and to, excuse me, determine whether APS has earned more than it's allowed return. 
As we mentioned on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, our 2018 ACC jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% ROE. 
Commission staff is in the process of reviewing our 2018 financial information, and I'll provide the commissioners with the report that the conclusion of their review. While the commission staff had originally been targeting a May 3 deadline for their report. The staff indicated during the open meeting on April 23 and 24 that they may need some additional time. 
Lastly, the commission approved our second refund to customers from federal tax reform. Starting April 1, we begin passing an additional $86 million back to customers. 
Together with the first $119 million in savings approved in 2018, customers will receive more than a $200 million rate decrease. The third and final tax refund request was filed with the commission on April 10 and is currently awaiting approval. 
If approved, team Phase 3 will return an additional $34 million to customers annually for the first 3 years. The tax reform reductions combined with additional savings from lower fuel cost or expected to lower bills of $14 per month or [ $168 a ] year for the average residential customer compared to 1 year ago. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling and maintenance outage for Palo Verde Unit 1 began on April 6. 
Additionally, the Ocotillo modernization project is on budget and schedule to have all 5 units in service by this summer. 
On August 1, we plan to file our preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. 
We're currently engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to gather input and ideas prior to our preliminary filing. The final IRP will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
An important part of our forecast, we'll be increasing the integration of clean energy resources and technology in an economically responsible manner. 
Clean energy resources not only reduce our carbon intensity, they also reduce O&M and fuel cost for customers. 
Similar to the bill savings from tax reform, these reductions will allow us to continue investing in technology and grid enhancements necessary to support additional clean energy while maintaining customer bills at an affordable level. 
As you know, in February, we announced the addition of nearly a gigawatt of new clean energy projects. Consistent with this plan, in April, we issued a request for proposal for 59 megawatts of storage that will be added to our existing Chino Valley and Red Rock Solar plants. Both projects are expected to be in service in 2021. 
We also issued a request for proposal for a new 100-megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage to be in service in 2021. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the equipment failures that occurred on April 19 that are making substation battery storage facility. 
During the response to this incident, firefighters from [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] Arizona were injured. Our hearts go out to the injured firefighters. 
We greatly appreciate their hard work and bravery in responding to this event. An investigation with APS, first responder representatives and third-party engineering and safety experts is underway. A thorough investigation will help us determine the cause of the failure. 
We have no reason to believe there any safety issues with similar energy storage facilities. However, we will use the findings from the investigation to ensure all our facilities are safe moving forward. 
In addition, we will continue with our plans to add clean energy projects to our system, including pairing storage with solar resources. Energy storage is a breakthrough technology, helping to solve challenges and create new opportunities for additional clean energy resources. 
In closing, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We're focused on operational excellence will also will define Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic clean energy investments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. As shown on Slide 3 the materials, for the first quarter of 2019 we are $0.16 per share compared to $0.03",882,"Thank you, Don and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. 
As shown on Slide 3 the materials, for the first quarter of 2019 we are $0.16 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2018. 
Higher adjusted gross margin and lower adjusted operating and maintenance expenses are the key positive drivers during the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.14 per share compared to the prior year [ first  ] quarter period. Favorable whether was a positive $0.14 gross margin impact during the quarter driven by the second coldest February in the last 4 years. 
Higher adjusted gross margin was also supported by a shift in the seasonality of revenue. The positive drivers were partially offset by lower transmission revenue and lower other gross margin. As Don mentioned, team Phase 2 was approved by the commission and was implemented beginning on April 1. 
The impact of the team Phase 2 is expected to be earnings neutral as both the timing of the refund and the offsetting income tax benefit will be recognized based on our seasonal sales pattern. 
Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1% in the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter period. As we mentioned last year, we expect to see the headwinds from energy efficiency and distributed generation decline, which will likely narrow the difference between customer growth and retail sales growth going forward. 
Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operation for maintenance expenses increased earnings [ $0.09  ] per share, primarily due to lower planned outage cost. Currently offsetting the positive earnings drivers were higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to planned additions and lower pension and other postretirement nonservice credits due to lower market returns. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we remain focused on achieving long-term benefits for customers and investors. We have a track record of cost management discipline, and we are taking the next steps in becoming a lean principal organization. 
We are committed to identifying new ways of working and strengthening our lean and digital capabilities in order to create cost reduction opportunity to keep customer rates affordable over the long term. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been among the national average. Through February of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.1% over 2018 compared to 1.8% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. 
Construction employment increased by 10.3% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.3%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial on economic development. 
In particular, we have had several recent announcements of companies moving to the West side of Metro Phoenix area. Red Bull announced they will build a 700,000 square feet facility in [indiscernible] and note distributor fair life plans in related 300,000 square-foot distribution facility in Goodyear. After announcements from string data centers, advantage data centers regarding plans to build in the West Valley, Microsoft recently confirmed their plans to build world-class data center facilities on 2 new sites in Goodyear. Phoenix was also ranked the second most active market in data center leasing in 2018 according to CBRE's latest U.S. data center trends report. 
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,800 compared to 2018 driven by single-family permits. 
We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.9% in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
According to the U.S. Census data, Maricopa County ranked #1 in the U.S. for population growth for the third straight year, and we believe Phoenix will remain one of the country's fastest-growing large Metropolitan areas. 
Switching to our financing activities. On February 26, APS entered into a $200 million unsecured term-loan facility that matures on August 26, 2020. 
On February 28, APS issued $300 million of 30-year [ on quarter  ] senior unsecured loans. The proceeds were used to repay the $500 million of [indiscernible] 3 quarter of senior notes that maturity. We continue to expect to issue up to $450 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 200 -- 2019. 
Overall the quarterly remain strong. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. 
A complete list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In terms of only the 1 unit versus Unit 1 and 3, frankly, there is an existing biomass plant in which APS is the off taker in northern Arizona. There is some level of uncertainty about long-term contracts, we're harvesting the biomass and slash from the northern Arizona forest to support multiple, multiple biomass plants, and so we're taking a conservative approach. Additionally, there are some gas pipeline issues that would prevent [indiscernible] from being converted to anything larger than a Unit 1 conversion of about 60 to 70 megawatts."

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
On April 9, Chief Administrative Law Judge, Jane Rodda issued a recommended opinion, an order or rule as we call it in the customer complaint docket. The rule states that the customer complaint should be dismissed. The rule also recommends that in the next rate review, APS, commission staff and other stakeholders collaborate on better ways to communicate the bill impacts to residential customers. 
The rule suggests that any further issues concerning the reasonableness of APS' rates or the adequacy of its customer education and outreach program be considered in the current rate review docket. 
The current rate review docket was opened by the commission in January to review APS' 2018 books and records and to, excuse me, determine whether APS has earned more than it's allowed return. 
As we have mentioned on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, our 2018 ACC jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% ROE. 
Commission staff is in the process of reviewing our 2018 financial information, and I'll provide the commissioners with the report at the conclusion of their review. While the commission staff had originally been targeting a May 3 deadline for their report. The staff indicated during the open meeting on April 23 and 24 that they may need some additional time. 
Lastly, the commission approved our second refund to customers from federal tax reform. Starting April 1, we began passing an additional $86 million back to customers. 
Together with the first $119 million in savings approved in 2018, customers will receive more than a $200 million rate decrease. The third and final tax refund request was filed with the commission on April 10 and is currently awaiting approval. 
If approved, TEAM Phase 3 will return an additional $34 million to customers annually for the first 3 years. The tax reform reductions combined with additional savings from lower fuel costs are expected to lower bills of $14 per month or $168 a year for the average residential customer compared to 1 year ago. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling and maintenance outage for Palo Verde Unit 1 began on April 6. 
Additionally, the Ocotillo modernization project is on budget and scheduled to have all 5 units in service by this summer. 
On August 1, we plan to file our preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. 
We're currently engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to gather input and ideas prior to our preliminary filing. The final IRP will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
An important part of our forecast, will be increasing the integration of clean energy resources and technology in an economically responsible manner. 
Clean energy resources not only reduce our carbon intensity, they also reduce O&M and fuel cost for customers. 
Similar to the bill savings from tax reform, these reductions will allow us to continue investing in technology and grid enhancements necessary to support additional clean energy while maintaining customer bills at an affordable level. 
As you know, in February, we announced the addition of nearly a gigawatt of new clean energy projects. Consistent with this plan, in April, we issued a request for proposal for 59 megawatts of storage that will be added to our existing Chino Valley and Red Rock Solar plants. Both projects are expected to be in service in 2021. 
We also issued a request for proposal for a new 100-megawatt solar facility, paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage to be in service in 2021. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the equipment failures that occurred on April 19 at our McMicken substation battery storage facility. 
During the response to this incident, firefighters from Surprise, and Peoria, Arizona were injured. Our hearts go out to the injured firefighters. 
We greatly appreciate their hard work and bravery in responding to this event. An investigation with APS first responder representatives and third-party engineering and safety experts is underway. A thorough investigation will help us determine the cause of the failure. 
We have no reason to believe there any safety issues with similar energy storage facilities. However, we will use the findings from the investigation to ensure all our facilities are safe moving forward. 
In addition, we will continue with our plans to add clean energy projects to our system, including pairing storage with solar resources. Energy storage is a breakthrough technology, helping to solve challenges and create new opportunities for additional clean energy resources. 
In closing, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We're focused on operational excellence while solidifying Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic clean energy investments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. As shown on Slide 3 the materials, for the first quarter of 2019 we are $0.16 per share compared to $0.03",873,"Thank you, Don and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. 
As shown on Slide 3 the materials, for the first quarter of 2019 we are $0.16 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2018. 
Higher adjusted gross margin and lower adjusted operating and maintenance expenses were the key positive drivers during the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.14 per share compared to the prior year  first  quarter period. Favorable weather was a positive $0.14 gross margin impact during the quarter driven by the second coldest February in the last  40 years. 
Higher adjusted gross margin was also supported by a shift in the seasonality of revenue. The positive drivers were partially offset by lower transmission revenue and lower other gross margin. As Don mentioned, TEAM Phase 2 was approved by the commission and was implemented beginning on April 1. 
The impact of the TEAM Phase 2 is expected to be earnings neutral as both the timing of the refund and the offsetting income tax benefits will be recognized based on our seasonal sales pattern. 
Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1% in the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter period. As we mentioned last year, we expect to see the headwinds from energy efficiency and distributed generation decline, which will likely narrow the difference between customer growth and retail sales growth going forward. 
Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expenses increased earnings  $0.09  per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs. Constantly offsetting the positive earnings drivers were higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to plant additions and lower pension and other postretirement nonservice credits due to lower market returns. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we remain focused on achieving long-term benefits for customers and investors. We have a track record of cost management discipline, and we are taking the next steps in becoming a lean principled organization. 
We are committed to identifying new ways of working and strengthening our lean and digital capabilities in order to create cost reduction opportunity to keep customer rates affordable over the long term. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been among the national average. Through February of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.1% over 2018 compared to 1.8% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. 
Construction employment increased by 10.3% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.3%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development. 
In particular, we have had several recent announcements of companies moving to the West side of Metro Phoenix area. Red Bull announced they will build a 700,000 square feet facility in Glendale, and milk distributor Fairlife plans to build a 300,000 square-foot distribution facility in Goodyear. After announcements from strain data centers and Vantage data centers regarding plans to build in the West Valley, Microsoft recently confirmed their plans to build world-class data center facilities on 2 new sites in Goodyear. Phoenix was also ranked the second most active market in data center leasing in 2018 according to CBRE's latest U.S. data center trends report. 
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post recession trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,800 compared to 2018 driven by single-family permits. 
We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
According to the U.S. Census data, Maricopa County ranked #1 in the U.S. for population growth for the third straight year, and we believe Phoenix will remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas. 
Switching to our financing activities. On February 26, APS entered into a $200 million unsecured term-loan facility that matures on August 26, 2020. 
On February 28, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.25% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were used to repay the $500 million of 8.75% senior notes at maturity. We continue to expect to issue up to $450 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 200 -- 2019. 
Overall liquidity remains strong. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. 
A complete list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And relatively short orders should be coming forth with summary of that analysis. And a discussion appears on the Corporation Commission then about, whether that appears to be the right approach to take for customers and/or companies, so asking to be patient a little bit longer. 
In terms of only the 1 unit versus Unit 1 and 3, frankly, there is an existing biomass plant within which APS is the off taker in northern Arizona. There is some level of uncertainty about long-term contracts, we're harvesting the biomass and slash from the Northern Arizona forest to support multiple, multiple biomass plants, and so we're taking a conservative approach. Additionally, there are some gas pipeline issues that would prevent Cholla from being converted to anything larger than a Unit 1 conversion of about 60 to 70 megawatts."

And so a lot of the things working through here are going to be important on how you do this in other places and so that was one of them. But the parties initially to the settlement said we think we should move customers to the most like, most similar rate structure, not necessarily the one that is best for them. And so what I think you'll see in this and the rate review case is fair amount of attention on that. How do you focus on the customer education piece of this.

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
On April 9, Chief Administrative Law Judge Jane Rodda issued a Recommended Opinion and Order, or ROO as we call it, in the customer complaint docket. The ROO states that the customer complaint should be dismissed. The ROO also recommends that in the next rate review, APS, commission staff and other stakeholders collaborate on better ways to communicate the bill impacts to residential customers. 
The ROO suggests that any further issues concerning the reasonableness of APS' rates or the adequacy of its customer education and outreach program be considered in the current rate review docket. 
The current rate review docket was opened by the commission in January to review APS' 2018 books and records and to, excuse me, determine whether APS has earned more than it's allowed return. 
As we have mentioned on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, our 2018 ACC jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% ROE. 
Commission staff is in the process of reviewing our 2018 financial information, and I'll provide the commissioners with the report at the conclusion of their review. While the commission staff had originally been targeting a May 3 deadline for their report, the staff indicated during the open meeting on April 23 and 24 that they may need some additional time. 
Lastly, the commission approved our second refund to customers from federal tax reform. Starting April 1, we began passing an additional $86 million back to customers. 
Together with the first $119 million in savings approved in 2018, customers will receive more than a $200 million rate decrease. The third and final tax refund request was filed with the commission on April 10 and is currently awaiting approval. 
If approved, TEAM Phase 3 will return an additional $34 million to customers annually for the first 3 years. The tax reform reductions combined with additional savings from lower fuel costs are expected to lower bills $14 per month or $168 a year for the average residential customer compared to 1 year ago. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling and maintenance outage for Palo Verde Unit 1 began on April 6. 
Additionally, the Ocotillo Modernization Project is on budget and scheduled to have all 5 units in service by this summer. 
On August 1, we plan to file our preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. 
We're currently engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to gather input and ideas prior to our preliminary filing. The final IRP will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
An important part of our forecast will be increasing the integration of clean energy resources and technology in an economically responsible manner. 
Clean energy resources not only reduce our carbon intensity, they also reduce O&M and fuel cost for customers. 
Similar to the bill savings from tax reform, these reductions will allow us to continue investing in technology and grid enhancements necessary to support additional clean energy while maintaining customer bills at an affordable level. 
As you know, in February, we announced the addition of nearly a gigawatt of new clean energy projects. Consistent with this plan, in April, we issued a request for proposal for 59 megawatts of storage that will be added to our existing Chino Valley and Red Rock Solar Plants. Both projects are expected to be in service in 2021. 
We also issued a request for proposal for a new 100-megawatt solar facility, paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage, to be in service in 2021. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the equipment failures that occurred on April 19 at our McMicken substation battery storage facility. 
During the response to this incident, firefighters from Surprise and Peoria, Arizona, were injured. Our hearts go out to the injured firefighters. 
We greatly appreciate their hard work and bravery in responding to this event. An investigation with APS first responder representatives and third-party engineering and safety experts is underway. A thorough investigation will help us determine the cause of the failure. 
We have no reason to believe there are any safety issues with similar energy storage facilities. However, we will use the findings from the investigation to ensure all our facilities are safe moving forward. 
In addition, we will continue with our plans to add clean energy projects to our system, including pairing storage with solar resources. Energy storage is a breakthrough technology, helping to solve challenges and create new opportunities for additional clean energy resources. 
In closing, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We're focused on operational excellence while solidifying Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic clean energy investments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2019, we earned $0.16 per share compared to",871,"Thank you, Don and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2019, we earned $0.16 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2018. 
Higher adjusted gross margin and lower adjusted operating and maintenance expenses were the key positive drivers during the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.14 per share compared to the prior year first quarter period. Favorable weather was a positive $0.14 gross margin impact during the quarter, driven by the second coldest February in the last 40 years. 
Higher adjusted gross margin was also supported by a shift in the seasonality of revenue. The positive drivers were partially offset by lower transmission revenue and lower other gross margin. As Don mentioned, TEAM Phase 2 was approved by the commission and was implemented beginning on April 1. 
The impact of TEAM Phase 2 is expected to be earnings neutral as both the timing of the refund and the offsetting income tax benefit will be recognized based on our seasonal sales pattern. 
Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1% in the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter period. As we mentioned last year, we expect to see the headwinds from energy efficiency and distributed generation decline, which will likely narrow the difference between customer growth and retail sales growth going forward. 
Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expenses increased earnings $0.09 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs.  Partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers were higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to plant additions and lower pension and other post-retirement non-service credits due to lower market returns. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we remain focused on achieving long-term benefits for customers and investors. We have a track record of cost management discipline, and we are taking the next steps in becoming a lean-principled organization. 
We are committed to identifying new ways of working and strengthening our lean and digital capabilities in order to create cost reduction opportunities to keep customer rates affordable over the long term. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been among the national average. Through February of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.1% over 2018 compared to 1.8% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. 
Construction employment increased by 10.3% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.3%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development. 
In particular, we have had several recent announcements of companies moving to the West side of the Metro Phoenix area. Red Bull announced they will build a 700,000 square-feet facility in Glendale, and milk distributor Fairlife plans to build a 300,000 square-foot distribution facility in Goodyear. After announcements from Stream Data Centers and Vantage Data Centers regarding plans to build in the West Valley, Microsoft recently confirmed their plans to build world-class data center facilities on 2 new sites in Goodyear. Phoenix was also ranked the second-most active market in data center leasing in 2018 according to CBRE's latest U.S. data center trends report. 
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post-recession trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,800 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. 
We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
According to the U.S. Census data, Maricopa County ranked #1 in the U.S. for population growth for the third straight year, and we believe Phoenix will remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas. 
Switching to our financing activities. On February 26, APS entered into a $200 million unsecured term loan facility that matures on August 26, 2020. 
On February 28, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.25% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were used to repay the $500 million of 8.75% senior notes at maturity. We continue to expect to issue up to $450 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 200 -- 2019. 
Overall, liquidity remains strong. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. 
A complete list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And in relatively short order, it should be coming forth with summary of that analysis, and a discussion at the Arizona Corporation Commission then about whether that appears to be the right approach to take for our customers and our companies, so asking you to be patient a little bit longer. 
In terms of only the 1 unit versus Unit 1 and 3, frankly, there is an existing biomass plant within which APS is the off-taker in northern Arizona. There is some level of uncertainty about long-term contracts for harvesting the biomass and slash from the Northern Arizona forest to support multiple, multiple biomass plants, and so we're taking a conservative approach. Additionally, there are some gas pipeline issues that would prevent Cholla from being converted to anything larger than a Unit 1 conversion of about 60 to 70 megawatts."

So the complexity with that, I think this was talked about at the hearing, was that the settling parties in that underlying rate case agreed on a framework where the customer would move on to the most like rate. And so there was a lot of customer outreach to try to encourage customers to move on to the best rate, but because of the -- this is -- we're ahead of the rest of the country, I think, in residential rate design. And so a lot of the things that we're working through here are going to be important in how you do this in other places, and so that was one of them. But the parties initially to the settlement said we think we should move customers to the most like, most similar rate structure, not necessarily the one that is best for them. And so what I think you'll see in this and the rate review case is a fair amount of attention on that: How do you focus on the customer education piece of this? And then how you factor that into revenue, you have to look at that in subsequent cases."

Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. 
Our first quarter 2019 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements cautionary language as well as Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
On April 9, Chief Administrative Law Judge Jane Rodda issued a Recommended Opinion and Order, or ROO as we call it, in the customer complaint docket. The ROO states that the customer complaint should be dismissed. The ROO also recommends that in the next rate review, APS, commission staff and other stakeholders collaborate on better ways to communicate the bill impacts to residential customers. 
The ROO suggests that any further issues concerning the reasonableness of APS' rates or the adequacy of its customer education and outreach program be considered in the current rate review docket. 
The current rate review docket was opened by the commission in January to review APS' 2018 books and records and to, excuse me, determine whether APS has earned more than it's allowed return. 
As we have mentioned on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, our 2018 ACC jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% ROE. 
Commission staff is in the process of reviewing our 2018 financial information, and I'll provide the commissioners with the report at the conclusion of their review. While the commission staff had originally been targeting a May 3 deadline for their report, the staff indicated during the open meeting on April 23 and 24 that they may need some additional time. 
Lastly, the commission approved our second refund to customers from federal tax reform. Starting April 1, we began passing an additional $86 million back to customers. 
Together with the first $119 million in savings approved in 2018, customers will receive more than a $200 million rate decrease. The third and final tax refund request was filed with the commission on April 10 and is currently awaiting approval. 
If approved, TEAM Phase 3 will return an additional $34 million to customers annually for the first 3 years. The tax reform reductions combined with additional savings from lower fuel costs are expected to lower bills $14 per month or $168 a year for the average residential customer compared to 1 year ago. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling and maintenance outage for Palo Verde Unit 1 began on April 6. 
Additionally, the Ocotillo Modernization Project is on budget and scheduled to have all 5 units in service by this summer. 
On August 1, we plan to file our preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. 
We're currently engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to gather input and ideas prior to our preliminary filing. The final IRP will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
An important part of our forecast will be increasing the integration of clean energy resources and technology in an economically responsible manner. 
Clean energy resources not only reduce our carbon intensity, they also reduce O&M and fuel cost for customers. 
Similar to the bill savings from tax reform, these reductions will allow us to continue investing in technology and grid enhancements necessary to support additional clean energy while maintaining customer bills at an affordable level. 
As you know, in February, we announced the addition of nearly a gigawatt of new clean energy projects. Consistent with this plan, in April, we issued a request for proposal for 59 megawatts of storage that will be added to our existing Chino Valley and Red Rock Solar Plants. Both projects are expected to be in service in 2021. 
We also issued a request for proposal for a new 100-megawatt solar facility, paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage, to be in service in 2021. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the equipment failures that occurred on April 19 at our McMicken substation battery storage facility. 
During the response to this incident, firefighters from Surprise and Peoria, Arizona, were injured. Our hearts go out to the injured firefighters. 
We greatly appreciate their hard work and bravery in responding to this event. An investigation with APS first responder representatives and third-party engineering and safety experts is underway. A thorough investigation will help us determine the cause of the failure. 
We have no reason to believe there are any safety issues with similar energy storage facilities. However, we will use the findings from the investigation to ensure all our facilities are safe moving forward. 
In addition, we will continue with our plans to add clean energy projects to our system, including pairing storage with solar resources. Energy storage is a breakthrough technology, helping to solve challenges and create new opportunities for additional clean energy resources. 
In closing, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We're focused on operational excellence while solidifying Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic clean energy investments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2019, we earned $0.16 per share compared to",871,"Thank you, Don and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2019, we earned $0.16 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2018. 
Higher adjusted gross margin and lower adjusted operating and maintenance expenses were the key positive drivers during the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.14 per share compared to the prior year first quarter period. Favorable weather was a positive $0.14 gross margin impact during the quarter, driven by the second coldest February in the last 40 years. 
Higher adjusted gross margin was also supported by a shift in the seasonality of revenue. The positive drivers were partially offset by lower transmission revenue and lower other gross margin. As Don mentioned, TEAM Phase 2 was approved by the commission and was implemented beginning on April 1. 
The impact of TEAM Phase 2 is expected to be earnings neutral as both the timing of the refund and the offsetting income tax benefit will be recognized based on our seasonal sales pattern. 
Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1% in the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter period. As we mentioned last year, we expect to see the headwinds from energy efficiency and distributed generation decline, which will likely narrow the difference between customer growth and retail sales growth going forward. 
Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expenses increased earnings $0.09 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs.  Partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers were higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to plant additions and lower pension and other post-retirement non-service credits due to lower market returns. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we remain focused on achieving long-term benefits for customers and investors. We have a track record of cost management discipline, and we are taking the next steps in becoming a lean-principled organization. 
We are committed to identifying new ways of working and strengthening our lean and digital capabilities in order to create cost reduction opportunities to keep customer rates affordable over the long term. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been among the national average. Through February of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.1% over 2018 compared to 1.8% for the entire U.S. Job growth remains strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors, a sign of strength in the regional economy. 
Construction employment increased by 10.3% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.3%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development. 
In particular, we have had several recent announcements of companies moving to the West side of the Metro Phoenix area. Red Bull announced they will build a 700,000 square-feet facility in Glendale, and milk distributor Fairlife plans to build a 300,000 square-foot distribution facility in Goodyear. After announcements from Stream Data Centers and Vantage Data Centers regarding plans to build in the West Valley, Microsoft recently confirmed their plans to build world-class data center facilities on 2 new sites in Goodyear. Phoenix was also ranked the second-most active market in data center leasing in 2018 according to CBRE's latest U.S. data center trends report. 
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post-recession trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,800 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. 
We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
According to the U.S. Census data, Maricopa County ranked #1 in the U.S. for population growth for the third straight year, and we believe Phoenix will remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas. 
Switching to our financing activities. On February 26, APS entered into a $200 million unsecured term loan facility that matures on August 26, 2020. 
On February 28, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.25% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were used to repay the $500 million of 8.75% senior notes at maturity. We continue to expect to issue up to $450 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 200 -- 2019. 
Overall, liquidity remains strong. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. 
A complete list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In terms of only the 1 unit versus Unit 1 and 3, frankly, there is an existing biomass plant within which APS is the off-taker in northern Arizona. There is some level of uncertainty about long-term contracts for harvesting the biomass and slash from the Northern Arizona forest to support multiple, multiple biomass plants, and so we're taking a conservative approach. Additionally, there are some gas pipeline issues that would prevent Cholla from being converted to anything larger than a Unit 1 conversion of about 60 to 70 megawatts."

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with expectations for the year. As you know weather provided above average revenue in the first quarter and significantly below average revenue in the second quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details of second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I have repeated many times over the years that are top priority every day is safety. The safety of our team, our customers and our communities takes priority over all other objectives. Recently, we experienced a loss of an APS team member, [indiscernible] Castille from an event that occurred while performing planned underground construction work in Downtown, Phoenix. this event is being fully reviewed, and we continue to keep [indiscernible] family in our thoughts and prayers. 
Turning to our operations Palo Verde Generating Station completed its planned refueling maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 9. Additionally, the [indiscernible] modernization project was completed on budget and with all 5 units in service by May 30. This valuable asset in the Metro Phoenix look like it has been performing well and is available to serve our customers through the summer peak. In preparation for summer, we not only ensure we have adequate generation resources that meet our peak demand, we also prepare for this summer Wild Fire season. In fact, we work here around and minimize the risk of wildfires. Our fire mitigation efforts include maintaining safe clearances, removing vegetation around equipment, physical pole inspection, coordination with fire and forest service authorities and partnering with community organizations that educate the public on how to protect their property from wildfires. 
As you know, on April 19, we experienced an equipment failure at the McMicken substation battery storage facility. We're looking into the cause of the failure other. At site, discharge of the batteries has been completed, and we have now begun a forensic analysis. The review is progressing but will take time to complete. We will continue to post updates at APS.com/McMicken. Because safety is our top priority, we will temporarily be delaying our investments in new battery storage resources to incorporate our learnings from this incident. Accordingly, the request for proposals issued in April for 60 megawatts of storage on our existing solar facilities and a new 100-megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage have been put on hold. I want to reinforce that we've remain committed to investing in new clean energy resources, including battery storage. This delay simply reflects a thoughtful and responsible pause to ensure we move forward in a safe and informed manner. While the social facilities are delayed, we will be issuing 2 new requests for proposals. The first RP is for up to 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar generation to be in service by 2021. This solar generation will be designed when the flexibility to install energy storage in the future. The second RP is for up to 250 megawatts of wind generation to be in service as soon as possible but no later than 2022. These new RFPs will expand our renewable energy portfolio to about 2,500 megawatts by 2021. On August 1, we filed a preliminary Integrated Resource Plan or IRP, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to reliably serve our customers in the future. The IRP is designed to explore a variety of options that can provide reliable and affordable power for our customers. And drafting the IRP, we work closely with the diverse group of stakeholders. The stakeholder group was engaged, provide constructive input and valuable feedback. We appreciate the collaborative effort of this group, and look forward to participating with interested stakeholders in the future. Going forward, we project that are annual peak demand and energy need will both increase at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 2% from 2020 through 2035. This forecast incorporates future demand side management and distributed generation. The future growth is primarily driven by population growth, economic growth and changing customer trends related to electric vehicles and distributed generation. The final Integrated Resource Plan will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. At their June open meeting, the Arizona Corporation Commission implemented a requirement that APS filed the case no later than October 31, 2019, using a June 30, 2019 test year. That's a July open meeting the ACC resolved a customer complaint and ordered APS to implement additional customer education and outreach programs. The commission also approved an electric vehicle policy implementation plan at the July open meeting. The EV policy implementation plan is intended to support EVs, EV infrastructure and the electrification of the transportation sector in Arizona. The plan encourages utilities to propose EV pilot programs focusing on infrastructure incentives and cost recovery among other items to the commission by September 1, 2019. We're aligned with the commission in exploring the opportunities electric vehicles present to advance our clean energy objectives. Our goal is to make driving EVs more convenient by reducing range anxiety through access to charging infrastructure. Our new take charge AZ pilot program does just that. They charge AZ provides charging infrastructure for fleets, workplaces and multifamily housing communities as well as highway fast charging infrastructure. We're also exploring innovative strategies to own and operate the fast charging stations, while partnering with local businesses to identify the most useful locations. 
On July 30, the commission held a workshop discussing both staffs draft retail competition rules and Commissioner Olson's recommendations on retail competition. Among other challenges, the proposed retail competition rules conflict with the Arizona Constitution, put reliability in jeopardy, require the creation of their regional transmission operator or Independent system operator and conflict with the commission's interest in establishing clean energy rules. It reports sponsored by Arizona energy group and prepared by concentric energy advisory analyzing retail competition over the past 20 years was filed with the commission on July 26. The report illustrates it states with retail competition is high residential rates been traditionally regulated states recognizing the potential negative impact on residential customers and the challenges I discussed we knew that believe that retail electric company children is in the best interests of our customers or the state of Arizona. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, safety is our top priority. After we've recently became aware of a customer's passing last September, we temporarily stopped residential power disconnects for non-Payment. Subsequently the Arizona Corporation commission issued a temporary rule proposing a statewide monetary amount on disconnects through the warmest months into mid-October. Addressing the needs of vulnerable Arizona and since it's a statewide objective, that's why we have committed to work with a broad range of Arizona stakeholders to develop solutions that help ensure Arizona and to have access to it's systems when needed most. 
In closing, as a company we have so much to be proud of. In 2019, public lands alliance awarded APS the corporate [indiscernible] award for our support at the Grand Canyon Conservancy. The annual award recognizes a company that demonstrated exceptional achievement to enhance the quality and visitor's experience in America's public lands. In addition, we earned the EEI advocacy excellence awards for our efforts around the defeat of the 2018 valid initiative. This award highlights the public policy engagement of the EEI member companies like APS. And I'm continually honored and proud to work with such a dedicated and talented team. We remain focused on preparing to meet the future needs of our customers and continuing to deliver long-term value to our investors. I'll now turn the call over to Jim"

This Monday, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We and $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter of 20",1001,"Thank you, Don and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This Monday, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We and $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The lower results were especially teal to unfavorable weather. As shown on Slide 2 of the materials, adjusted gross margin was down $0.53 per share compared to the prior year's second quarter period. Higher sales -- the [indiscernible] and transmission revenues were more than offset by an unfavorable weather, which negatively impacted gross margin by $0.31 per share. To understand the magnitude of weather, May was the coolest May since 1980 and the Memorial Day high temperature in Phoenix [indiscernible] for the coolest on record. Additionally, June was the coolest in the last 8 years. Also contributing to lower gross margin work lower other margin and refund to customers due to tax reform. This quarter we had a negative net impact and tax reform due to the timing of the FERC corporate tax refund to customers, which was implemented in June of last year. Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expense positively impacted earnings $0.20 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs and lower parent-level costs. 
Last quarter I shared that we will be implementing lean-principled initiative to continue our track record to cops management discipline and streamlining our processes. This process as part of a larger effort while we are calling customer affordability to identify stable siblings that have a positive impact on customer bills by simpling the way we work. Over the past few months, we engaged many employees from across the enterprise and hosted workshop to identify ways to streamlining our processes, deploy technology and ultimately reduce costs. While this effort will take time to mature, we continue to manage costs consistent with our historical track record. 
Turning now to Arizona's economy. As you can see on Slide 3, this takes focus on growth is continuing to pay dividends. In particular, we continue to see data center and other infection development on the west side of Metro Phoenix. Last week, Microsoft confirmed plans to build 3 world-class data center campuses in Gujrat, indiscernible. Construction on all 3 sides has begun and Microsoft intends to power the facilities with a 100% renewable energy. In addition, [indiscernible] plans to build a multimillion dollar Manufacturing plant in good year bringing approximately 500 jobs to the area. Last month, campus centers announced a construction of its first -- of 2 data centers, which are projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2 data center are expect to be realized megawatts of new load. Going forward, compass data centers expected to campus 350 megawatts with an on-site 230 kV substation. As a result, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. Through May of 2019 employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.7% for the entire U.S. Construction employment increased by 11.6% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.5%. The strong job growth in the construction sector can easily be seen in Downtown, Phoenix. Numerous job sites equipped with clients and construction crews are visible across the Downtown area. We expect business expansion and related job growth to continue to support economic development. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job growth and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market, and the economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona remain. 
Turning to guidance and our financial outlook. As we look to the second half of 2019, we continue to evaluate our financial expectations and opportunities. As Don mentioned, we are temporarily deploying new energy storage although the projects are delayed until the project to capital expenditure levels to the forecast. Remain the same. We have relocated the capital that will depend energy storage to accelerate other distribution and possible projects. Also, with the change in timing of -- for our next rate case we have reevaluated our financing plans. As a result, we will not require any additional equity of patentable long-term debt for the remainder of 2019. However, we will continue to have a strong equity there. The equity ratio at the end of the test year was approximately 54.7%. Despite the mild weather in the first of the year, we continue to expect Pinnacle West Capital consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. However, I would add to the low end due to weather today. The third quarter references over 60% of our full year results and as we have experienced, weather in the third quarter converted significantly. [indiscernible] success will be managing our cost the impact of increases in customer load, primarily from the data centers, as I mentioned earlier, and normal weather for the remainder of 2019. A complete list of our key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. We expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This excludes any funding for the refinancing of APS is $250 million, a 2.2% senior notes with maturing January 2020. Overall, liquidity remains strong. And that concludes our prepared remarks, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

But there is interest in saying can you go do more and I -- if you're right this is primarily something that is of interest to the large customers who have seen opportunity to go out and buy on energy-only basis. And part of what you have to talk about is how do you fairly reflect the capacity value the income and utilities fleets bring to the system and so if that's where the a lot of interest is.

In preparation for summer, we not only ensure we have adequate generation resources that meet our peak demand, we also prepare for this summer wildfire season. In fact, we work year around to minimize the risk of wildfires. Our fire mitigation efforts include maintaining safe clearances, removing vegetation around equipment, physical pole inspection, coordination with fire and forest service authorities and partnering with community organizations that educate the public on how to protect their property from wildfires. 
As you know, on April 19, we experienced an equipment failure at the McMicken substation battery storage facility. We're looking into the cause of the failure. At site, discharge of the batteries has been completed, and we have now begun a forensic analysis. The review is progressing but will take time to complete. We will continue to post updates at APS.com/McMicken. Because safety is our top priority, we will temporarily be delaying our investments in new battery storage resources to incorporate our learnings from this incident. Accordingly, the request for proposals issued in April for 60 megawatts of storage on our existing solar facilities and a new 100-megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage have been put on hold. I want to reinforce that we remain committed to investing in new clean energy resources, including battery storage. This delay simply reflects a thoughtful and responsible pause to ensure we move forward in a safe and informed manner. While the storage facilities are delayed, we will be issuing 2 new requests for proposals. The first RFP is for up to 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar generation to be in service by 2021. This solar generation will be designed with the flexibility to install energy storage in the future. The second RFP is for up to 250 megawatts of wind generation to be in service as soon as possible but no later than 2022. These new RFPs will expand our renewable energy portfolio to about 2,500 megawatts by 2021. On August 1, we filed a preliminary Integrated Resource Plan or IRP, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to reliably serve our customers in the future. The IRP is designed to explore a variety of options that can provide reliable and affordable power for our customers. And drafting the IRP, we worked closely with the diverse group of stakeholders. The stakeholder group was engaged, provided constructive input and valuable feedback. We appreciate the collaborative effort of this group, and look forward to participating with interested stakeholders in the future. Going forward, we project that our annual peak demand and energy need will both increase at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 2% from 2020 through 2035. This forecast incorporates future demand side management and distributed generation. The future growth is primarily driven by population growth, economic growth and changing customer trends related to electric vehicles and distributed generation. The final Integrated Resource Plan will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. At their June open meeting, the Arizona Corporation Commission implemented a requirement that APS file a rate case no later than October 31, 2019, using a June 30, 2019 test year. At the July open meeting, the ACC resolved the customer complaint and ordered APS to implement additional customer education and outreach programs. The commission also approved an electric vehicle policy implementation plan at the July open meeting. The EV policy implementation plan is intended to support EVs, EV infrastructure and the electrification of the transportation sector in Arizona.
The plan encourages utilities to propose EV pilot programs, focusing on infrastructure incentives and cost recovery among other items to the commission by September 1, 2019. We're aligned with the commission in exploring the opportunities electric vehicles present to advance our clean energy objectives. Our goal is to make driving EVs more convenient by reducing range anxiety through access to charging infrastructure. Our new Take Charge AZ pilot program does just that. Take Charge AZ provides charging infrastructure for fleets, workplaces and multifamily housing communities, as well as highway fast-charging infrastructure. We're also exploring innovative strategies to own and operate the fast-charging stations, while partnering with local businesses to identify the most useful locations. 
On July 30, the commission held a workshop discussing both staff's draft retail competition rules and Commissioner Olson's recommendations on retail competition. Among other challenges, the proposed retail competition rules conflict with the Arizona Constitution, put reliability in jeopardy, require the creation of their regional transmission operator or independent system operator and conflict with the commission's interest in establishing clean energy rules. A report sponsored by Arizona Energy Policy Group and prepared by concentric energy advisors, analyzing retail competition over the past 20 years, was filed with the commission on July 26. The report illustrates, it states with retail competition as higher residential rates than traditionally regulated states, recognizing the potential negative impact on residential customers and the challenges I discussed within that believe that retail electric competition is in the best interest of our customers or the State of Arizona. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, safety is our top priority. After we recently became aware of a customer's passing last September, we temporarily stopped residential power disconnects for non-payment. Subsequently, the Arizona Corporation Commission issued a temporary rule, proposing a statewide moratorium on disconnects through the warmest months into mid-October. Addressing the needs of vulnerable Arizonans is a statewide objective, that's why we have committed to work with a broad range of Arizona stakeholders to develop solutions that help ensure Arizonans have access to assistance when they need it most. 
In closing, as a company, we have so much to be proud of. In 2019, Public Lands Alliance awarded APS the Corporate Stewardship Award for our support of the Grand Canyon Conservancy. The annual award recognizes a company that demonstrated exceptional achievement to enhance the quality and visitor's experience in America's public lands. In addition, we earned the EEI Advocacy Excellence Award for our efforts around the defeat of the 2018 ballot initiative. This award highlights the public policy engagement of the EEI member companies like APS. And I'm continually honored and proud to work with such a dedicated and talented team. We remain focused on preparing to meet the future needs of our customers and continuing to deliver long-term value to our investors. I'll now turn the call to -- over to Jim"

And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We earned $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter",1015,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We earned $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The lower results were largely due to unfavorable weather. As shown on Slide 2 of the materials, adjusted gross margin was down $0.53 per share compared to the prior year second quarter period. Higher sales, BLFCR and transmission revenues were more than offset by unfavorable weather, which negatively impacted gross margin by $0.31 per share. To understand the magnitude of weather, May was the coolest May since 1980, and the Memorial Day high temperature in Phoenix tied for the coolest on record. Additionally, June was the coolest in the last 8 years. Also contributing to lower gross margin were lower other margin and refund to customers due to tax reform. This quarter, we had a negative net impact and tax reform due to the timing of the FERC corporate tax refund to customers, which was implemented in June of last year. Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expense positively impacted earnings $0.20 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs and lower parent-level costs. 
Last quarter I shared that we will be implementing lean-principled initiative to continue our track record to cost management discipline and streamlining our processes. This process is part of a larger effort what we are calling customer affordability to identify sustainable savings that have a positive impact on customer bills by simplifying the way we work. Over the past few months, we engaged many employees from across the enterprise and hosted workshops to identify ways to streamline our processes, deploy technology and ultimately, reduce costs. While this effort will take time to mature, we continue to manage costs consistent with our historical track record. 
Turning now to Arizona's economy. As you can see on Slide 3, the state's focus on growth is continuing to pay dividends. In particular, we continue to see data center and other manufacturing development on the west side of Metro Phoenix. Last week, Microsoft confirmed plans to build 3 world-class data center campuses in, Goodyear and indiscernible. Construction on all 3 sites has begun, and Microsoft intends to power the facilities with a 100% renewable energy. In addition, Nike now plans to build a multimillion dollar manufacturing plant in Goodyear, bringing approximately 500 jobs to the area. Last month, Compass Datacenters announced a construction of its first -- of 2 data centers, which are projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2 data centers are expected to utilize 72 megawatts of new load. Going forward, Compass Datacenters expect the campus could grow up to 350 megawatts with an on-site 230 KV substation. As a result, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. Through May of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.7% for the entire U.S. Construction employment increased by 11.6%, and manufacturing employment increased by 4.5%. The strong job growth in the construction sector can easily be seen in Downtown, Phoenix. Numerous job sites equipped with cranes and staff with construction crews are visible across the Downtown area. We expect business expansion and related job growth to continue to support economic development. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend.
 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job growth and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS' retail customer grades -- customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona remains.
Turning to guidance and our financial outlook. As we look to the second half of 2019, we continue to evaluate our financial expectations and opportunities. As Don mentioned, we are temporarily delaying investment in new energy storage. Although, the projects are delayed, our total projected capital expenditure levels through the forecasted period remain the same. We have reallocated the capital that would have been spent on energy storage to accelerate other distribution at fossil projects. Also, with the change in timing of -- for our next rate case, we have reevaluated our financing plans. As a result, we will not require any additional equity of parent-level long-term debt for the remainder of 2019. However, we will continue to have a strong equity layer. The equity ratio at the end of the test year was approximately 54.7%. Despite the mild weather in the first of the year, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. However, I would guide you to the low end due to weather today. The third quarter represents over 60% of our full year results and as we have experienced, weather in the third quarter can vary significantly. Keys to success will be managing our costs, the impact of increases in customer load, primarily from the data centers, as I mentioned earlier, and normal weather for the remainder of 2019. A complete list of our key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. We expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This excludes any funding for the refinancing of APS is $250 million, a 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020. Overall, liquidity remains strong. And that concludes our prepared remarks, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So legal working group, technical working group, and again, that was before you had retail competition in a lot of states. But it took multiple years of folks working through the different issues, and then it's a multiple years to move forward on the implementation path that we were pursuing then until the California energy crisis hit and that's what put everything on hold and then we had to unwind some of the work that had been done during that process. But I don't know that it would take as long this time, given that there's been more experience in retail competition. But as you know, if you're actually talking about standing up an RTO, there's a lot of issues that you'd have to work through, particularly how it would interface with California. And what impact it would have since we're participating in the energy imbalance market and crediting customers with off-system sales revenues that we get from that. If you stop doing that because you stand your own RTO up, that's going to affect all customers, and so they've got to work through a lot of these technical issues, I think, to come to the conclusion of whether to move into a formal rule making or how that formal rule making would develop."

But we've worked on the commercial side in our last couple of rate cases and putting some creative buy-through provisions that allowed those customers and some customers to go out and kind of working through us, go out and secure power resources for themselves. It's a limited number of megawatts that can do that because of the need -- if you scale that up you've got to get an RTO in place and so we've done it to where we can accommodate it. But there is interest in saying, can you go do more and I think you're right, I mean, this is primarily something that is of interest to the large commercial customers who've seen opportunity to go out and buy on an energy-only basis. And part of what you have to talk about is how do you fairly reflect the capacity value the income and utilities fleets bring to the system and so that's where a lot of the interest is.

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know weather provided above average revenue in the first quarter and significantly below average revenue in the second quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I have repeated many times over the years that our top priority every day is safety. The safety of our team, our customers and our communities takes priority over all other objectives. Recently, we experienced the loss of an APS team member, [Rico Custio], from an event that occurred while performing planned underground construction work in Downtown, Phoenix. This event is being fully reviewed, and we continue to keep [Rico's] family in our thoughts and prayers. 
Turning to our operations, Palo Verde Generating Station completed its planned refueling maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 9. Additionally, the Ocotillo modernization project was completed on budget and with all 5 units in service by May 30.
This valuable asset in the Metro Phoenix load pocket has been performing well and is available to serve our customers through the summer peak. In preparation for summer, we not only ensure we have adequate generation resources that meet our peak demand, we also prepare for this summer wildfire season. In fact, we work year around to minimize the risk of wildfires. Our fire mitigation efforts include maintaining safe clearances, removing vegetation around equipment, physical pole inspection, coordination with fire and forest service authorities and partnering with community organizations that educate the public on how to protect their property from wildfires. 
As you know, on April 19, we experienced an equipment failure at the McMicken substation battery storage facility. We're looking into the cause of the failure. At site, discharge of the batteries has been completed, and we have now begun a forensic analysis. The review is progressing but will take time to complete. We will continue to post updates at APS.com/McMicken. Because safety is our top priority, we will temporarily be delaying our investments in new battery storage resources to incorporate our learnings from this incident. Accordingly, the request for proposals issued in April for 60 megawatts of storage on our existing solar facilities and a new 100-megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage have been put on hold. I want to reinforce that we remain committed to investing in new clean energy resources, including battery storage. This delay simply reflects a thoughtful and responsible pause to ensure we move forward in a safe and informed manner. While the storage facilities are delayed, we will be issuing 2 new requests for proposals. The first RFP is for up to 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar generation to be in service by 2021. This solar generation will be designed with the flexibility to install energy storage in the future. The second RFP is for up to 250 megawatts of wind generation to be in service as soon as possible but no later than 2022. These new RFPs will expand our renewable energy portfolio to about 2,500 megawatts by 2021. On August 1, we filed a preliminary Integrated Resource Plan or IRP, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to reliably serve our customers in the future. The IRP is designed to explore a variety of options that can provide reliable and affordable power for our customers. And drafting the IRP, we worked closely with the diverse group of stakeholders. The stakeholder group was engaged, provided constructive input and valuable feedback. We appreciate the collaborative effort of this group, and look forward to participating with interested stakeholders in the future. Going forward, we project that our annual peak demand and energy need will both increase at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 2% from 2020 through 2035. This forecast incorporates future demand-side management and distributed generation. The future growth is primarily driven by population growth, economic growth and changing customer trends related to electric vehicles and distributed generation. The final Integrated Resource Plan will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. At their June open meeting, the Arizona Corporation Commission implemented a requirement that APS file a rate case no later than October 31, 2019, using a June 30, 2019 test year. At the July open meeting, the ACC resolved the customer complaint and ordered APS to implement additional customer education and outreach programs. The commission also approved an electric vehicle policy implementation plan at the July open meeting. The EV policy implementation plan is intended to support EVs, EV infrastructure and the electrification of the transportation sector in Arizona.
The plan encourages utilities to propose EV pilot programs, focusing on infrastructure incentives and cost recovery among other items to the commission by September 1, 2019. We're aligned with the commission in exploring the opportunities electric vehicles present to advance our clean energy objectives. Our goal is to make driving EVs more convenient by reducing range anxiety through access to charging infrastructure. Our new Take Charge AZ pilot program does just that. Take Charge AZ provides charging infrastructure for fleets, workplaces and multifamily housing communities, as well as highway fast-charging infrastructure. We're also exploring innovative strategies to own and operate the fast-charging stations, while partnering with local businesses to identify the most useful locations. 
On July 30, the commission held a workshop discussing both staff's draft retail competition rules and Commissioner Olson's recommendations on retail competition. Among other challenges, the proposed retail competition rules conflict with the Arizona Constitution, put reliability in jeopardy, require the creation of their regional transmission operator or independent system operator and conflict with the commission's interest in establishing clean energy rules. A report sponsored by Arizona Energy Policy Group and prepared by concentric energy advisors, analyzing retail competition over the past 20 years, was filed with the commission on July 26. The report illustrates, it states with retail competition as higher residential rates than traditionally regulated states, recognizing the potential negative impact on residential customers and the challenges I discussed within that believe that retail electric competition is in the best interest of our customers or the State of Arizona. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, safety is our top priority. After we recently became aware of a customer's passing last September, we temporarily stopped residential power disconnects for non-payment. Subsequently, the Arizona Corporation Commission issued a temporary rule, proposing a statewide moratorium on disconnects through the warmest months into mid-October. Addressing the needs of vulnerable Arizonans is a statewide objective, that's why we have committed to work with a broad range of Arizona stakeholders to develop solutions that help ensure Arizonans have access to assistance when they need it most. 
In closing, as a company, we have so much to be proud of. In 2019, Public Lands Alliance awarded APS the Corporate Stewardship Award for our support of the Grand Canyon Conservancy. The annual award recognizes a company that demonstrated exceptional achievement to enhance the quality and visitor's experience in America's public lands. In addition, we earned the EEI Advocacy Excellence Award for our efforts around the defeat of the 2018 ballot initiative. This award highlights the public policy engagement of the EEI member companies like APS. And I'm continually honored and proud to work with such a dedicated and talented team. We remain focused on preparing to meet the future needs of our customers and continuing to deliver long-term value to our investors. I'll now turn the call to -- over to Jim"

And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We earned $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter",1016,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We earned $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The lower results were largely due to unfavorable weather. As shown on Slide 2 of the materials, adjusted gross margin was down $0.53 per share compared to the prior year second quarter period. Higher sales, BLFCR and transmission revenues were more than offset by unfavorable weather, which negatively impacted gross margin by $0.31 per share. To understand the magnitude of weather, May was the coolest May since 1980, and the Memorial Day high temperature in Phoenix tied for the coolest on record. Additionally, June was the coolest in the last 8 years. Also contributing to lower gross margin were lower other margin and refund to customers due to tax reform. This quarter, we had a negative net impact and tax reform due to the timing of the FERC corporate tax refund to customers, which was implemented in June of last year. Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expense positively impacted earnings $0.20 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs and lower parent-level costs. 
Last quarter I shared that we will be implementing lean-principled initiative to continue our track record to cost management discipline and streamlining our processes. This process is part of a larger effort what we are calling customer affordability to identify sustainable savings that have a positive impact on customer bills by simplifying the way we work. Over the past few months, we engaged many employees from across the enterprise and hosted workshops to identify ways to streamline our processes, deploy technology and ultimately, reduce costs. While this effort will take time to mature, we continue to manage costs consistent with our historical track record. 
Turning now to Arizona's economy. As you can see on Slide 3, the state's focus on growth is continuing to pay dividends. In particular, we continue to see data center and other manufacturing development on the west side of Metro Phoenix. Last week, Microsoft confirmed plans to build 3 world-class data center campuses in, Goodyear and El Mirage. Construction on all 3 sites has begun, and Microsoft intends to power the facilities with a 100% renewable energy. In addition, Nike now plans to build a multimillion dollar manufacturing plant in Goodyear, bringing approximately 500 jobs to the area. Last month, Compass Datacenters announced a construction of its first -- of 2 data centers, which are projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2 data centers are expected to utilize 72 megawatts of new load. Going forward, Compass Datacenters expect the campus could grow up to 350 megawatts with an on-site 230 KV substation. As a result, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. Through May of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.7% for the entire U.S. Construction employment increased by 11.6%, and manufacturing employment increased by 4.5%. The strong job growth in the construction sector can easily be seen in Downtown, Phoenix. Numerous job sites equipped with cranes and staff with construction crews are visible across the Downtown area. We expect business expansion and related job growth to continue to support economic development. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend.
 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job growth and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS' retail customer grades -- customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona remains.
Turning to guidance and our financial outlook. As we look to the second half of 2019, we continue to evaluate our financial expectations and opportunities. As Don mentioned, we are temporarily delaying investment in new energy storage. Although, the projects are delayed, our total projected capital expenditure levels through the forecasted period remain the same. We have reallocated the capital that would have been spent on energy storage to accelerate other distribution at fossil projects. Also, with the change in timing of -- for our next rate case, we have reevaluated our financing plans. As a result, we will not require any additional equity of parent-level long-term debt for the remainder of 2019. However, we will continue to have a strong equity layer. The equity ratio at the end of the test year was approximately 54.7%. Despite the mild weather in the first of the year, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. However, I would guide you to the low end due to weather today. The third quarter represents over 60% of our full year results and as we have experienced, weather in the third quarter can vary significantly. Keys to success will be managing our costs, the impact of increases in customer load, primarily from the data centers, as I mentioned earlier, and normal weather for the remainder of 2019. A complete list of our key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. We expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This excludes any funding for the refinancing of APS is $250 million, a 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020. Overall, liquidity remains strong. And that concludes our prepared remarks, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So legal working group, technical working group, and again, that was before you had retail competition in a lot of states. But it took multiple years of folks working through the different issues, and then it's a multiple years to move forward on the implementation path that we were pursuing then until the California energy crisis hit and that's what put everything on hold and then we had to unwind some of the work that had been done during that process. But I don't know that it would take as long this time, given that there's been more experience in retail competition. But as you know, if you're actually talking about standing up an RTO, there's a lot of issues that you'd have to work through, particularly how it would interface with California. And what impact it would have since we're participating in the energy imbalance market and crediting customers with off-system sales revenues that we get from that. If you stop doing that because you stand your own RTO up, that's going to affect all customers, and so they've got to work through a lot of these technical issues, I think, to come to the conclusion of whether to move into a formal rule making or how that formal rule making would develop."

I think the staff's concern is let's make sure we do understand all the consequences, all the potential impacts and so it's not a new pressure, it certainly has more attention now. But we've worked on the commercial side in our last couple of rate cases and putting some creative buy-through provisions that allowed those customers and some customers to go out and kind of working through us, go out and secure power resources for themselves. It's a limited number of megawatts that can do that because of the need -- if you scale that up you've got to get an RTO in place, and so we've done it to where we can accommodate it. But there is interest in saying, can you go do more and I think you're right, I mean, this is primarily something that is of interest to the large commercial customers who've seen opportunity to go out and buy on an energy-only basis. And part of what you have to talk about is how do you fairly reflect the capacity value the income and utilities fleets bring to the system and so that's where a lot of the interest is. And residential, I think that they're interested in talking about it, but that's a really hard one to do and certainly hard to do community choice aggregation, I think it's pretty impossible to do community choice aggregation without being in an RTO and having some kind of underlying dispatch going on."

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided above-average revenue in the first quarter and significantly below average revenue in the second quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I have repeated many times over the years that our top priority every day is safety. The safety of our team, our customers and our communities takes priority over all other objectives. Recently, we experienced the loss of an APS team member, [Rico Custio], from an event that occurred while performing planned underground construction work in Downtown, Phoenix. This event is being fully reviewed, and we continue to keep [Rico's] family in our thoughts and prayers. 
Turning to our operations, Palo Verde Generating Station completed its planned refueling maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 9. Additionally, the Ocotillo modernization project was completed on budget and with all 5 units in service by May 30.
This valuable asset in the Metro Phoenix load pocket has been performing well and is available to serve our customers through the summer peak. In preparation for summer, we not only ensure we have adequate generation resources that meet our peak demand, we also prepare for this summer wildfire season. In fact, we work year around to minimize the risk of wildfires. Our fire mitigation efforts include maintaining safe clearances, removing vegetation around equipment, physical pole inspection, coordination with fire and forest service authorities and partnering with community organizations that educate the public on how to protect their property from wildfires. 
As you know, on April 19, we experienced an equipment failure at the McMicken substation battery storage facility. We're looking into the cause of the failure. At site, discharge of the batteries has been completed, and we have now begun a forensic analysis. The review is progressing but will take time to complete. We will continue to post updates at APS.com/McMicken. Because safety is our top priority, we will temporarily be delaying our investments in new battery storage resources to incorporate our learnings from this incident. Accordingly, the request for proposals issued in April for 60 megawatts of storage on our existing solar facilities and a new 100-megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage have been put on hold. I want to reinforce that we remain committed to investing in new clean energy resources, including battery storage. This delay simply reflects a thoughtful and responsible pause to ensure we move forward in a safe and informed manner. While the storage facilities are delayed, we will be issuing 2 new requests for proposals. The first RFP is for up to 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar generation to be in service by 2021. This solar generation will be designed with the flexibility to install energy storage in the future. The second RFP is for up to 250 megawatts of wind generation to be in service as soon as possible but no later than 2022. These new RFPs will expand our renewable energy portfolio to about 2,500 megawatts by 2021. On August 1, we filed a preliminary Integrated Resource Plan or IRP, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to reliably serve our customers in the future. The IRP is designed to explore a variety of options that can provide reliable and affordable power for our customers. And drafting the IRP, we worked closely with the diverse group of stakeholders. The stakeholder group was engaged, provided constructive input and valuable feedback. We appreciate the collaborative effort of this group, and look forward to participating with interested stakeholders in the future. Going forward, we project that our annual peak demand and energy need will both increase at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 2% from 2020 through 2035. This forecast incorporates future demand-side management and distributed generation. The future growth is primarily driven by population growth, economic growth and changing customer trends related to electric vehicles and distributed generation. The final Integrated Resource Plan will be filed with the commission in April of 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. At their June open meeting, the Arizona Corporation Commission implemented a requirement that APS file a rate case no later than October 31, 2019, using a June 30, 2019 test year. At the July open meeting, the ACC resolved the customer complaint and ordered APS to implement additional customer education and outreach programs. The commission also approved an electric vehicle policy implementation plan at the July open meeting. The EV policy implementation plan is intended to support EVs, EV infrastructure and the electrification of the transportation sector in Arizona.
The plan encourages utilities to propose EV pilot programs, focusing on infrastructure incentives and cost recovery among other items to the commission by September 1, 2019. We're aligned with the commission in exploring the opportunities electric vehicles present to advance our clean energy objectives. Our goal is to make driving EVs more convenient by reducing range anxiety through access to charging infrastructure. Our new Take Charge AZ pilot program does just that. Take Charge AZ provides charging infrastructure for fleets, workplaces and multifamily housing communities, as well as highway fast-charging infrastructure. We're also exploring innovative strategies to own and operate the fast-charging stations, while partnering with local businesses to identify the most useful locations. 
On July 30, the commission held a workshop discussing both staff's draft retail competition rules and Commissioner Olson's recommendations on retail competition. Among other challenges, the proposed retail competition rules conflict with the Arizona Constitution, put reliability in jeopardy, require the creation of their regional transmission operator or independent system operator and conflict with the commission's interest in establishing clean energy rules. A report sponsored by Arizona Energy Policy Group and prepared by concentric energy advisors, analyzing retail competition over the past 20 years, was filed with the commission on July 26. The report illustrates, it states with retail competition as higher residential rates than traditionally regulated states, recognizing the potential negative impact on residential customers and the challenges I discussed within that believe that retail electric competition is in the best interest of our customers or the State of Arizona. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, safety is our top priority. After we recently became aware of a customer's passing last September, we temporarily stopped residential power disconnects for non-payment. Subsequently, the Arizona Corporation Commission issued a temporary rule, proposing a statewide moratorium on disconnects through the warmest months into mid-October. Addressing the needs of vulnerable Arizonans is a statewide objective, that's why we have committed to work with a broad range of Arizona stakeholders to develop solutions that help ensure Arizonans have access to assistance when they need it most. 
In closing, as a company, we have so much to be proud of. In 2019, Public Lands Alliance awarded APS the Corporate Stewardship Award for our support of the Grand Canyon Conservancy. The annual award recognizes a company that demonstrated exceptional achievement to enhance the quality and visitor's experience in America's public lands. In addition, we earned the EEI Advocacy Excellence Award for our efforts around the defeat of the 2018 ballot initiative. This award highlights the public policy engagement of the EEI member companies like APS. And I'm continually honored and proud to work with such a dedicated and talented team. We remain focused on preparing to meet the future needs of our customers and continuing to deliver long-term value to our investors. I'll now turn the call to -- over to Jim"

The lower results were largely due to unfavorable weather. As shown on Slide 2 of the materials, adjusted gross margin was down $0.53 per share compared to the prior year second quarter period. Higher sales, BLFCR and transmission revenues were more than offset by unfavorable weather, which negatively impacted gross margin by $0.31 per share. To understand the magnitude of weather, May was the coolest May since 1980, and the Memorial Day high temperature in Phoenix tied for the coolest on record. Additionally, June was the coolest in the last 8 years. Also contributing to lower gross margin were lower other margin and refund to customers due to tax reform. This quarter, we had a negative net impact and tax reform due to the timing of the FERC corporate tax refund to customers, which was implemented in June of last year. Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expense positively impacted earnings $0.20 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs and lower parent-level costs. 
Last quarter I shared that we will be implementing lean-principled initiative to continue our track record to cost management discipline and streamlining our processes. This process is part of a larger effort what we are calling customer affordability to identify sustainable savings that have a positive impact on customer bills by simplifying the way we work. Over the past few months, we engaged many employees from across the enterprise and hosted workshops to identify ways to streamline our processes, deploy technology and ultimately, reduce costs. While this effort will take time to mature, we continue to manage costs consistent with our historical track record. 
Turning now to Arizona's economy. As you can see on Slide 3, the state's focus on growth is continuing to pay dividends. In particular, we continue to see data center and other manufacturing development on the west side of Metro Phoenix. Last week, Microsoft confirmed plans to build 3 world-class data center campuses in, Goodyear and El Mirage. Construction on all 3 sites has begun, and Microsoft intends to power the facilities with a 100% renewable energy. In addition, Nike now plans to build a multimillion-dollar manufacturing plant in Goodyear, bringing approximately 500 jobs to the area. Last month, Compass Datacenters announced a construction of its first -- of 2 data centers, which are projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2 data centers are expected to utilize 72 megawatts of new load. Going forward, Compass Datacenters expect the campus could grow up to 350 megawatts with an on-site 230 KV substation. As a result, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. Through May of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.7% for the entire U.S. Construction employment increased by 11.6%, and manufacturing employment increased by 4.5%. The strong job growth in the construction sector can easily be seen in Downtown, Phoenix. Numerous job sites equipped with cranes and staff with construction crews are visible across the Downtown area. We expect business expansion and related job growth to continue to support economic development. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend.
 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job growth and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally, to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS' retail customer grades -- customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona remains.
Turning to guidance and our financial outlook. As we look to the second half of 2019, we continue to evaluate our financial expectations and opportunities. As Don mentioned, we are temporarily delaying investment in new energy storage. Although, the projects are delayed, our total projected capital expenditure levels through the forecasted period remain the same. We have reallocated the capital that would have been spent on energy storage to accelerate other distribution at fossil projects. Also, with the change in timing of -- for our next rate case, we have reevaluated our financing plans. As a result, we will not require any additional equity of parent-level long-term debt for the remainder of 2019. However, we will continue to have a strong equity layer. The equity ratio at the end of the test year was approximately 54.7%. Despite the mild weather in the first of the year, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. However, I would guide you to the low end due to weather today. The third quarter represents over 60% of our full year results and as we have experienced, weather in the third quarter can vary significantly. Keys to success will be managing our costs, the impact of increases in customer load, primarily from the data centers, as I mentioned earlier, and normal weather for the remainder of 2019. A complete list of our key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 6 and 7 of the materials. We expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This excludes any funding for the refinancing of APS is $250 million, a 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020. Overall, liquidity remains strong. And that concludes our prepared remarks, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So legal working group, technical working group, and again, that was before you had retail competition in a lot of states. But it took multiple years of folks working through the different issues, and then it's a multiple years to move forward on the implementation path that we were pursuing then until the California energy crisis hit and that's what put everything on hold and then we had to unwind some of the work that had been done during that process. But I don't know that it would take as long this time, given that there's been more experience in retail competition. But as you know, if you're actually talking about standing up an RTO, there's a lot of issues that you'd have to work through, particularly how it would interface with California. And what impact it would have since we're participating in the energy imbalance market and crediting customers with off-system sales revenues that we get from that. If you stop doing that because you stand your own RTO up, that's going to affect all customers, and so they've got to work through a lot of these technical issues, I think, to come to the conclusion of whether to move into a formal rulemaking or how that formal rulemaking would develop."

I think the staff's concern is let's make sure we do understand all the consequences, all the potential impacts and so it's not a new pressure, it certainly has more attention now. But we've worked on the commercial side in our last couple of rate cases and putting some creative buy-through provisions that allowed those customers and some customers to go out and kind of working through us, go out and secure power resources for themselves. It's a limited number of megawatts that can do that because of the need -- if you scale that up you've got to get an RTO in place, and so we've done it to where we can accommodate it. But there is interest in saying, can you go do more and I think you're right, I mean, this is primarily something that is of interest to the large commercial customers who've seen opportunity to go out and buy on an energy-only basis. And part of what you have to talk about is how do you fairly reflect the capacity value the income and utilities fleets bring to the system and so that's where a lot of the interest is.

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided significantly below average revenue in the second quarter and was mild in the third quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details of our third quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on current regulatory and operational developments. The 2019 summer season was successfully completed by focusing on our core priorities, delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy. June began with relatively mild temperatures, which for resource planning meant heavy imports from California renewables and watching for over generation during the Mid day hours, while July and August had 23 days over 110 degrees. It was the driest summer in the last 20 years, with less than one inch of rain between June and the end of September. The lack of humidity can impact peak demand, which was 7,270 megawatts in 2019, following 200 megawatts short of the 2018 peak. Our evaluation of the McMackin substation battery storage facility, equipment failure is ongoing. The fire occurred on 1 rack containing 14 battery modules. The rack that experienced the fire has been disassembled and was shipped to a forensic lab in Michigan where it's undergoing a series of tests.  While we remain committed to our investments in energy storage, it's imperative that we move forward safely. We expect that more specifics on what a safer path forward looks like shouldn't be available by the end of this year or early 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. We filed a rate case on October 31, 2019. Key components of the filing include a 10.15% return on equity, a 1% return on the fair value increment, 54.7% equity layer and 12 months of post test year plant. We've requested an increase in annual revenue of $184 million. This includes $73 million for the 4 corners selective catalytic reduction project that is the subject of a separate ACC proceeding. We proposed that new rates go into effect on December 1, 2020. The rate case filing highlights technology-driven programs, we're already pursuing on behalf of our customers, including our participation in the western energy imbalance market, our participation in this market not only provides greater ability to manage our grid and the intermittent resources in our service territory. It also provides access to the increasing availability of negative-priced energy. Our customers have realized gross savings of over $120 million during the 3 years, EPS has been a member of EIM. In further support of our customers, our filing contains 3 proposals to benefit the most vulnerable. We propose increasing funding for our crisis Bill assistant program from $1.25 million to $2.5 million annually, expanding the ways in which customers may enroll in our limited income, bill discount program and deferring costs for our bill discount program, allowing for expanded program growth. We're also responding to customers by proposing a flat build pilot program. This subscription rate will offer customers an option to be billed the same amount each month similar to an unlimited use cell phone plan. Programs like this demonstrate our commitment to increase customer choice and provide options that fit our customers' lifestyles. 
In addition, we have heard the commission's request for transparency in our financial status on a more frequent basis. In response, we have proposed an alternative formula rate concept for the commission's consideration. The benefits of a formula rate in addition to the annual transparency and accountability include annual earnings calibration, annual ACC approval, a reduction in the need for adjustor mechanisms and rate gradualism for customers. The commission has a number of other open dockets, including final disconnection rules and retail choice. We anticipate another retail competition workshop may be scheduled in December or in early 2020 to continue evaluating the complexities of retail choice. 
In the disconnection rules docket, commission staff has proposed draft rules for the commissioners to consider. We do not know the timing or next steps in this docket. On October 29, the commission approved our third tax expense adjustor mechanism filing, refunding, another $103 million to customers. Including this third filing refunds to our retail customers from federal tax reform will total $547 million by the end of 2020, allowing us to continue investing in the system, while keeping bills affordable. 
Earlier this year, I announced my retirement date of November 15. While I look forward to what's ahead, I can't say enough about the immense pride I have in the performance of this company over my tenure. The strength of our team and the dedication of our people drive our success, and I have no doubt that success will continue under Jeff's leadership. I wish you all the best, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of",908,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of the earnings drivers can be found on Slide 3 of the materials. Given the impact year-to-date from below normal weather, we would not expect to hit the lower end of the $4.75 to $4.95, 2019 guidance range. 
As illustrated on Slide 26, through the end of the third quarter of 2019, weather decreased gross margin, a total of $24 million or $0.16 per share. October sales are also below expectations due in part to another month of mild weather. 
For the full year 2019, we expect a negative weather impact will be partially offset by lower O&M and the approval of the TEAM 3 refund. As we look ahead to 2020, we will continue to enhance our customer and shareholder value through our cost management discipline. We have a long track record of managing our costs and continuous improvement. The customer affordability effort challenges our employees to find ways to work better and more efficiently challenged bureaucracy and eliminate unnecessary work in our daily operations, all of which are based on lean principles. It's working harder will not get us there. We must find different general rates to get the job done and cost savings will result. Although we are in the early stages of the customer affordability initiative, we have identified $20 million of potential O&M savings that will serve as a positive driver in 2020. We are introducing 2020 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Given the rate case outcome is unlikely to materially impact 2020 earnings. There are no assumptions regarding a rate case outcome incorporated into the guidance range. Positive drivers for 2020 include lower O&M sales growth, higher transmission revenue and the apical deferral. We expect our O&M will decrease approximately $25 million from 2019 to 2020. The main drivers for lower O&M include the closure of the nevo generating station, reductions from our customer affordability initiative and lower planned outage expense. We expect these drivers will be partially offset by an increase in expense associated with revised disconnect policies, higher depreciation and amortization, higher property taxes, higher interest expense and lower AFUDC. We currently estimate that the disconnection moratorium and revised policies could result in a decrease of approximately $20 million to $30 million of pretax income in 2020, depending upon certain assumptions, including customer behavior. The estimated effective tax rate of 14% for 2020 reflects benefits associated with the amortization of $45 million in excess deferred taxes associated with the TEAM 2 and TEAM 3 filings. These effective tax rate benefits are substantially offset by the refunds provided to customers as part of the team filings. 
Going forward, we will need a modest amount of equity to support the growth in clean energy investments our customers want, while supporting our strong equity layer. We will continue to evaluate our equity needs, including the form and timing of any issuance as our capital expenditure plans progress. We expect to issue $300 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. We this may include a portion of our funding needs for the refinancing of the APS [ $350 million ], 2.2 senior notes, which mature in January 2020. We also expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million at Pinnacle West during 2020. 
Overall, liquidity remains strong. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 and 2020 guidance can be found on slides 5 through 7. In addition to our cost management, we stand to benefit from organic growth in our service territory as a result of economic development. According to the Arizona Technology Council's quarterly impact report, Arizona's tech sector is growing at rate 40% faster than the U.S. overall. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. Through August of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% as compared to 1.6 for the entire U.S. construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 10.8% and manufacturing employment increased by 5%. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 2.1% in the third quarter of 2019. So we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends, I just discussed. 
In closing, our long-term rate outlook remains at 6% to 7%, and we expect to achieve a weather normalized annual consolidated return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2020. As illustrated on Slide 8, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. When we reach the end of our rate case cycle as we will in 2020, regulatory lag can slow our earnings growth. However, over the long term, the opportunity to partner with stakeholders across Arizona to build a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided significantly below average revenue in the second quarter and was mild in the third quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details of our third quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on current regulatory and operational developments. The 2019 summer season was successfully completed by focusing on our core priorities, delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy. June began with relatively mild temperatures, which for resource planning meant heavy imports from California renewables and watching for over generation during the midday hours, while July and August had 23 days over 110 degrees. It was the driest summer in the last 20 years, with less than one inch of rain between June and the end of September. The lack of humidity can impact peak demand, which was 7,270 megawatts in 2019, following 200 megawatts short of the 2018 peak. Our evaluation of the McMicken substation battery storage facility equipment failure is ongoing.
The fire occurred on one rack containing 14 battery modules. The rack that experienced the fire has been disassembled and was shipped to a forensic lab in Michigan where it's undergoing a series of tests. While we remain committed to our investments in energy storage, it's imperative that we move forward safely. We expect that more specifics on what a safer path forward looks like shouldn't be available by the end of this year or early 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. We filed a rate case on October 31, 2019. Key components of the filing include a 10.15% return on equity, a 1% return on the fair value increment, 54.7% equity layer and 12 months of posttest year plant. We've requested an increase in annual revenue of $184 million. This includes $73 million for the 4 corners selective catalytic reduction project that is the subject of a separate ACC proceeding. We proposed that new rates go into effect on December 1, 2020. The rate case filing highlights technology-driven programs, we're already pursuing on behalf of our customers, including our participation in the western energy imbalance market. Our participation in this market not only provides greater ability to manage our grid and the intermittent resources in our service territory, it also provides access to the increasing availability of negative-priced energy. Our customers have realized gross savings of over $120 million during the 3 years, EPS has been a member of EIM. In further support of our customers, our filing contains 3 proposals to benefit the most vulnerable. We propose increasing funding for our Crisis Bill Assistant (sic) [ Assistance ] program from $1.25 million to $2.5 million annually, expanding the ways in which customers may enroll in our limited income, bill discount program and deferring costs for our bill discount program, allowing for expanded program growth. We're also responding to customers by proposing a flat bill pilot program. This subscription rate will offer customers an option to be billed the same amount each month similar to an unlimited use cell phone plan. Programs like this demonstrate our commitment to increase customer choice and provide options that fit our customers' lifestyles. 
In addition, we have heard the commission's request for transparency in our financial status on a more frequent basis. In response, we have proposed an alternative formula rate concept for the commission's consideration. The benefits of a formula rate in addition to the annual transparency and accountability include annual earnings calibration, annual ACC approval, a reduction in the need for adjustor mechanisms and rate gradualism for customers. The commission has a number of other open dockets, including final disconnection, rules and retail choice. We anticipate another retail competition workshop may be scheduled in December or in early 2020 to continue evaluating the complexities of retail choice. 
In the disconnection rules docket, commission staff has proposed draft rules for the commissioners to consider. We do not know the timing or next steps in this docket. 
On October 29, the commission approved our third tax expense adjustor mechanism filing, refunding, another $103 million to customers. Including this third filing refunds to our retail customers from Federal Tax Reform will total $547 million by the end of 2020, allowing us to continue investing in the system, while keeping bills affordable. 
Earlier this year, I announced my retirement date of November 15. While I look forward to what's ahead, I can't say enough about the immense pride I have in the performance of this company over my tenure. The strength of our team and the dedication of our people drive our success, and I have no doubt that success will continue under Jeff's leadership. I wish you all the best, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,639179666,1857143,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of",908,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of the earnings drivers can be found on Slide 3 of the materials. Given the impact year-to-date from below normal weather, we would not expect to hit the lower end of the $4.75 to $4.95, 2019 guidance range. 
As illustrated on Slide 26, through the end of the third quarter of 2019, weather decreased gross margin, a total of $24 million or $0.16 per share. October sales are also below expectations due, in part, to another month of mild weather. 
For the full year 2019, we expect a negative weather impact will be partially offset by lower O&M and the approval of the TEAM 3 refund. As we look ahead to 2020, we will continue to enhance our customer and shareholder value through our cost management discipline. We have a long track record of managing our costs and continuous improvement. The customer affordability effort challenges our employees to find ways to work better and more efficiently challenged bureaucracy and eliminate unnecessary work in our daily operations, all of which are based on lean principles. Just working harder will not get us there. We must find different general rates to get the job done and cost savings will result. Although we are in the early stages of the customer affordability initiative, we have identified $20 million of potential O&M savings that will serve as a positive driver in 2020. 
We are introducing 2020 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Given the rate case outcome is unlikely to materially impact 2020 earnings. There are no assumptions regarding a rate case outcome incorporated into the guidance range. Positive drivers for 2020 include lower O&M, sales growth, higher transmission revenue and the Ocotillo deferral. 
We expect our O&M will decrease approximately $25 million from 2019 to 2020. The main drivers for lower O&M include the closure of the Navajo Generating Station, reductions from our customer affordability initiative and lower planned outage expense. We expect these drivers will be partially offset by an increase in expense associated with revised disconnect policies, higher depreciation and amortization, higher property taxes, higher interest expense and lower AFUDC. 
We currently estimate that the disconnection moratorium and revised policies could result in a decrease of approximately $20 million to $30 million of pretax income in 2020, depending upon certain assumptions, including customer behavior. The estimated effective tax rate of 14% for 2020 reflects benefits associated with the amortization of $45 million in excess deferred taxes associated with the TEAM 2 and TEAM 3 filings. These effective tax rate benefits are substantially offset by the refunds provided to customers as part of the team filings. 
Going forward, we will need a modest amount of equity to support the growth in clean energy investments our customers want, while supporting our strong equity layer. We will continue to evaluate our equity needs, including the form and timing of any issuance as our capital expenditure plans progress. 
We expect to issue $300 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This may include a portion of our funding needs for the refinancing of the APS $250 million, 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020. We also expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million at Pinnacle West during 2020. 
Overall, liquidity remains strong. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 and 2020 guidance can be found on Slides 5 through 7. In addition to our cost management, we stand to benefit from organic growth in our service territory as a result of economic development. According to the Arizona Technology Council's quarterly impact report, Arizona's tech sector is growing at a rate 40% faster than the U.S. overall. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. 
Through August of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% as compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 10.8% and manufacturing employment increased by 5%. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.1% in the third quarter of 2019. So we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7%, and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2020. As illustrated on Slide 8, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. When we reach the end of our rate case cycle as we will in 2020, regulatory lag can slow our earnings growth. However, over the long term, the opportunity to partner with stakeholders across Arizona to build a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success. 
And this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided significantly below average revenue in the second quarter and was mild in the third quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details of our third quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on current regulatory and operational developments. The 2019 summer season was successfully completed by focusing on our core priorities, delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy. 
June began with relatively mild temperatures, which for resource planning meant heavy imports from California renewables and watching for over generation during the midday hours, while July and August had 23 days over 110 degrees. It was the driest summer in the last 20 years, with less than one inch of rain between June and the end of September. The lack of humidity can impact peak demand, which was 7,270 megawatts in 2019, following 200 megawatts short of the 2018 peak. Our evaluation of the McMicken substation battery storage facility equipment failure is ongoing.
The fire occurred on one rack containing 14 battery modules. The rack that experienced the fire has been disassembled and was shipped to a forensic lab in Michigan where it's undergoing a series of tests. While we remain committed to our investments in energy storage, it's imperative that we move forward safely. We expect that more specifics on what a safer path forward looks like should be available by the end of this year or early 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. We filed a rate case on October 31, 2019. Key components of the filing include a 10.15% return on equity, a 1% return on the fair value increment, 54.7% equity layer and 12 months of posttest year plant. We've requested an increase in annual revenue of $184 million. This includes $73 million for the 4 corners selective catalytic reduction project that is the subject of a separate ACC proceeding. We proposed that new rates go into effect on December 1, 2020. The rate case filing highlights technology-driven programs, we're already pursuing on behalf of our customers, including our participation in the western energy imbalance market. 
Our participation in this market not only provides greater ability to manage our grid and the intermittent resources in our service territory, it also provides access to the increasing availability of negative-priced energy. Our customers have realized gross savings of over $120 million during the 3 years, EPS has been a member of EIM. In further support of our customers, our filing contains 3 proposals to benefit the most vulnerable. We propose increasing funding for our Crisis Bill Assistant (sic) [ Assistance ] program from $1.25 million to $2.5 million annually, expanding the ways in which customers may enroll in our limited income, bill discount program and deferring costs for our bill discount program, allowing for expanded program growth. 
We're also responding to customers by proposing a flat bill pilot program. This subscription rate will offer customers an option to be billed the same amount each month similar to an unlimited use cell phone plan. Programs like this demonstrate our commitment to increase customer choice and provide options that fit our customers' lifestyles. 
In addition, we have heard the commission's request for transparency in our financial status on a more frequent basis. In response, we have proposed an alternative formula rate concept for the commission's consideration. The benefits of a formula rate in addition to the annual transparency and accountability include annual earnings calibration, annual ACC approval, a reduction in the need for adjustor mechanisms and rate gradualism for customers. The commission has a number of other open dockets, including final disconnection, rules and retail choice. We anticipate another retail competition workshop may be scheduled in December or in early 2020 to continue evaluating the complexities of retail choice. 
In the disconnection rules docket, commission staff has proposed draft rules for the commissioners to consider. We do not know the timing or next steps in this docket. 
On October 29, the commission approved our third tax expense adjustor mechanism filing, refunding, another $103 million to customers. Including this third filing refunds to our retail customers from Federal Tax Reform will total $547 million by the end of 2020, allowing us to continue investing in the system, while keeping bills affordable. 
Earlier this year, I announced my retirement date of November 15. While I look forward to what's ahead, I can't say enough about the immense pride I have in the performance of this company over my tenure. The strength of our team and the dedication of our people drive our success, and I have no doubt that success will continue under Jeff's leadership. I wish you all the best, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of",909,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of the earnings drivers can be found on Slide 3 of the materials. Given the impact year-to-date from below normal weather, we would not expect to hit the lower end of the $4.75 to $4.95, 2019 guidance range. 
As illustrated on Slide 26, through the end of the third quarter of 2019, weather decreased gross margin, a total of $24 million or $0.16 per share. October sales are also below expectations due, in part, to another month of mild weather. 
For the full year 2019, we expect a negative weather impact will be partially offset by lower O&M and the approval of the TEAM 3 refund. As we look ahead to 2020, we will continue to enhance our customer and shareholder value through our cost management discipline. We have a long track record of managing our costs and continuous improvement. The customer affordability effort challenges our employees to find ways to work better and more efficiently, challenge bureaucracy and eliminate unnecessary work in our daily operations, all of which are based on lean principles. Just working harder will not get us there. We must find different and better ways to get the job done and cost savings will result. Although we are in the early stages of the customer affordability initiative, we have identified $20 million of potential O&M savings that will serve as a positive driver in 2020. 
We are introducing 2020 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Given the rate case outcome is unlikely to materially impact 2020 earnings, there are no assumptions regarding a rate case outcome incorporated into the guidance range. Positive drivers for 2020 include lower O&M, sales growth, higher transmission revenue and the Ocotillo deferral. 
We expect our O&M will decrease approximately $25 million from 2019 to 2020. The main drivers for lower O&M include the closure of the Navajo Generating Station, reductions from our customer affordability initiative and lower planned outage expense. We expect these drivers will be partially offset by an increase in expense associated with revised disconnect policies, higher depreciation and amortization, higher property taxes, higher interest expense and lower AFUDC. 
We currently estimate that the disconnection moratorium and revised policies could result in a decrease of approximately $20 million to $30 million of pretax income in 2020, depending upon certain assumptions, including customer behavior. The estimated effective tax rate of 14% for 2020 reflects benefits associated with the amortization of $45 million in excess deferred taxes associated with the TEAM 2 and TEAM 3 filings. These effective tax rate benefits are substantially offset by the refunds provided to customers as part of the team filings. 
Going forward, we will need a modest amount of equity to support the growth in clean energy investments our customers want, while supporting our strong equity layer. We will continue to evaluate our equity needs, including the form and timing of any issuances as our capital expenditure plans progress. 
We expect to issue $300 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This may include a portion of our funding needs for the refinancing of the APS $250 million, 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020. We also expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million at Pinnacle West during 2020. 
Overall, liquidity remains strong. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 and 2020 guidance can be found on Slides 5 through 7. In addition to our cost management, we stand to benefit from organic growth in our service territory as a result of economic development. According to the Arizona Technology Council's quarterly impact report, Arizona's tech sector is growing at a rate 40% faster than the U.S. overall. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. 
Through August of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% as compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 10.8% and manufacturing employment increased by 5%. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.1% in the third quarter of 2019. So we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7%, and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2020. As illustrated on Slide 8, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. When we reach the end of a rate case cycle as we will in 2020, regulatory lag can slow our earnings growth. However, over the long term, the opportunity to partner with stakeholders across Arizona to build a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success. 
And this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided significantly below average revenue in the second quarter and was mild in the third quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details of our third quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on current regulatory and operational developments. The 2019 summer season was successfully completed by focusing on our core priorities, delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy. 
June began with relatively mild temperatures, which for resource planning meant heavy imports from California renewables and watching for overgeneration during the midday hours, while July and August had 23 days over 110 degrees. It was the driest summer in the last 20 years, with less than 1 inch of rain between June and the end of September. The lack of humidity can impact peak demand, which was 7,270 megawatts in 2019, following 200 megawatts short of the 2018 peak. Our evaluation of the McMicken substation battery storage facility equipment failure is ongoing.
The fire occurred on one rack containing 14 battery modules. The rack that experienced the fire has been disassembled and was shipped to a forensic lab in Michigan where it's undergoing a series of tests. While we remain committed to our investments in energy storage, it's imperative that we move forward safely. We expect that more specifics on what a safer path forward looks like should be available by the end of this year or early 2020. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. We filed a rate case on October 31, 2019. Key components of the filing include a 10.15% return on equity, a 1% return on the fair value increment, 54.7% equity layer and 12 months of posttest year plant. We've requested an increase in annual revenue of $184 million. This includes $73 million for the 4 corners selective catalytic reduction project that is the subject of a separate ACC proceeding. We proposed that new rates go into effect on December 1, 2020. The rate case filing highlights technology-driven programs, we're already pursuing on behalf of our customers, including our participation in the western energy imbalance market. 
Our participation in this market not only provides greater ability to manage our grid and the intermittent resources in our service territory, it also provides access to the increasing availability of negative-priced energy. Our customers have realized gross savings of over $120 million during the 3 years, EPS has been a member of EIM. In further support of our customers, our filing contains 3 proposals to benefit the most vulnerable. We propose increasing funding for our Crisis Bill Assistant (sic) [ Assistance ] program from $1.25 million to $2.5 million annually, expanding the ways in which customers may enroll in our limited income, bill discount program and deferring costs for our bill discount program, allowing for expanded program growth. 
We're also responding to customers by proposing a flat bill pilot program. This subscription rate will offer customers an option to be billed the same amount each month similar to an unlimited use cell phone plan. Programs like this demonstrate our commitment to increase customer choice and provide options that fit our customers' lifestyles. 
In addition, we have heard the commission's request for transparency in our financial status on a more frequent basis. In response, we have proposed an alternative formula rate concept for the commission's consideration. The benefits of a formula rate in addition to the annual transparency and accountability include annual earnings calibration, annual ACC approval, a reduction in the need for adjustor mechanisms and rate gradualism for customers. The commission has a number of other open dockets, including final disconnection, rules and retail choice. We anticipate another retail competition workshop may be scheduled in December or in early 2020 to continue evaluating the complexities of retail choice. 
In the disconnection rules docket, commission staff has proposed draft rules for the commissioners to consider. We do not know the timing or next steps in this docket. 
On October 29, the commission approved our third tax expense adjustor mechanism filing, refunding, another $103 million to customers. Including this third filing refunds to our retail customers from Federal Tax Reform will total $547 million by the end of 2020, allowing us to continue investing in the system, while keeping bills affordable. 
Earlier this year, I announced my retirement date of November 15. While I look forward to what's ahead, I can't say enough about the immense pride I have in the performance of this company over my tenure. The strength of our team and the dedication of our people drive our success, and I have no doubt that success will continue under Jeff's leadership. 
I wish you all the best, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,639179666,1864023,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of",909,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of the earnings drivers can be found on Slide 3 of the materials. Given the impact year-to-date from below normal weather, we would not expect to hit the lower end of the $4.75 to $4.95, 2019 guidance range. 
As illustrated on Slide 26, through the end of the third quarter of 2019, weather decreased gross margin, a total of $24 million or $0.16 per share. October sales are also below expectations due, in part, to another month of mild weather. 
For the full year 2019, we expect a negative weather impact will be partially offset by lower O&M and the approval of the TEAM 3 refund. As we look ahead to 2020, we will continue to enhance our customer and shareholder value through our cost management discipline. We have a long track record of managing our costs and continuous improvement. The customer affordability effort challenges our employees to find ways to work better and more efficiently, challenge bureaucracy and eliminate unnecessary work in our daily operations, all of which are based on lean principles. Just working harder will not get us there. We must find different and better ways to get the job done and cost savings will result. Although we are in the early stages of the customer affordability initiative, we have identified $20 million of potential O&M savings that will serve as a positive driver in 2020. 
We are introducing 2020 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Given the rate case outcome is unlikely to materially impact 2020 earnings, there are no assumptions regarding a rate case outcome incorporated into the guidance range. Positive drivers for 2020 include lower O&M, sales growth, higher transmission revenue and the Ocotillo deferral. 
We expect our O&M will decrease approximately $25 million from 2019 to 2020. The main drivers for lower O&M include the closure of the Navajo Generating Station, reductions from our customer affordability initiative and lower planned outage expense. We expect these drivers will be partially offset by an increase in expense associated with revised disconnect policies, higher depreciation and amortization, higher property taxes, higher interest expense and lower AFUDC. 
We currently estimate that the disconnection moratorium and revised policies could result in a decrease of approximately $20 million to $30 million of pretax income in 2020, depending upon certain assumptions, including customer behavior. The estimated effective tax rate of 14% for 2020 reflects benefits associated with the amortization of $45 million in excess deferred taxes associated with the TEAM 2 and TEAM 3 filings. These effective tax rate benefits are substantially offset by the refunds provided to customers as part of the team filings. 
Going forward, we will need a modest amount of equity to support the growth in clean energy investments our customers want, while supporting our strong equity layer. We will continue to evaluate our equity needs, including the form and timing of any issuances as our capital expenditure plans progress. 
We expect to issue $300 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This may include a portion of our funding needs for the refinancing of the APS $250 million, 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020. We also expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million at Pinnacle West during 2020. 
Overall, liquidity remains strong. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 and 2020 guidance can be found on Slides 5 through 7. In addition to our cost management, we stand to benefit from organic growth in our service territory as a result of economic development. According to the Arizona Technology Council's quarterly impact report, Arizona's tech sector is growing at a rate 40% faster than the U.S. overall. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. 
Through August of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% as compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 10.8% and manufacturing employment increased by 5%. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. 
In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.1% in the third quarter of 2019. So we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. 
In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7%, and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2020. As illustrated on Slide 8, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. When we reach the end of a rate case cycle as we will in 2020, regulatory lag can slow our earnings growth. However, over the long term, the opportunity to partner with stakeholders across Arizona to build a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success. 
And this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."
