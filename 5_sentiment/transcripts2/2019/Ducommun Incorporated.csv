As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company. After which, Doug will review our financial results in detail. First, I'm happy to report that the Ducommun had a strong finish to 2018 with very good results which, I believe, are indicative of the many actions and initiatives implemented to improve the company's operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue grew a robust 15% year-over-year to $164 million to reflect higher shipments across both commercial and military platforms. In addition, full year sales rose to $629 million from $558 million in 2017, an increase of over 10%. At the same time, we ended the year with the record backlog of $864 million, up more than $125 million year-over-year. This demonstrate and shows the company's success in leveraging innovation, technology, as well as our commitment to customer value. These results are also fully engaged on winning new business penetrating further into existing client platforms. At the same time, the company also generated $46 million in cash from operations and strengthened our financial flexibility by refinancing our debt, as Doug will review in a moment. Our restructuring action in 2018 were to streamline our operations, improve capacity utilization and increase margins and the team delivered in all 3 areas. We have moved almost 16% of total manufacturing floor space and eliminated about $14 million of annualized cost going forward, all without any customer disruptions. We also flattened our organizational structure and reduced costs while hiring new talent and investing in employee development. The team rationalized the product portfolio as well, removing low-performing programs from the company. In addition to the restructuring, Ducommun successfully integrated 2 accretive acquisitions that strengthened our margins, enhanced our proprietary technology and boasted our growth profile. All these activities position the company very well for the future.
As shareholders who attended the company Investor Day November, along with comments on previous quarterly calls, the team is also focused on operational excellence and higher returns in 2018 particularly within our structures business. The results, through a lot of hard work, were significant with structures adjusted operating margin, in particular, more than doubling to 10.7% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% a year earlier. An outstanding improvement within a short period and everyone is proud of what we've been able to achieve. As we look forward to the future, the team is continually focused on product innovation, differentiation in the marketplace to ensure continued top line growth and solid margins. Whether it's our proprietary VersaCore composite core technology or the company's expanding array of engineered products, Ducommun is committed to niche applications that provide high value to the industry. The company is in excellent shape as we begin 2019 and we're working on improving every day. Now let me provide you some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $73 million, up 13% last year reflecting strong sales across a variety of missile applications. For the total year, revenue was $277 million for the sector representing growth of roughly 3% over 2017, driven by key platforms such as the F-18, F-35, Apache helicopter, along with the Patriot and other missile-related programs. We anticipate continued strong results within this portion of our business based on the outlook for military spending. I might note that the initial DoD budget for fiscal 2020 is anticipated to be at least $720 billion. This is above the current budget. But Ducommun, we ended the year with military, space backlog just above -- or excuse me, just under $340 million and that's near record levels. For our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $80 million. We once again saw a significant growth across a large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft reflecting higher build rates, the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are also very pleased to see a nice uptick in business with ViaSat for electronics tied to in-flight connectivity. For 2018, as a whole, we posted commercial revenue of $304 million representing growth of nearly 29% year-over-year. Our 737 business grew 30% in 2018 and for the first time ever, topped $100 million in sales. At the same time, we continue to ramp up content on the A320 which is a terrific story with Airbus being a fairly new commercial customer. We're optimistic about our continued growth in 2019 once again being driven by Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320 programs as well as our business with Gulfstream and other Boeing platform such as the 787. As a reminder, volume plans to increase 737 production to 57 a month this year from 52 in 2018 and 787 production to 14 a month from 12 last year, a real benefit for Ducommun. I'd also like to mention our VersaCore technology is growing in popularity and we're on track with regards to our 10-year $200 million contract to supply and to sell components for a leading aircraft engine OEM. We will complete the industrialization plan this year with manufacturing in Mexico and expect to begin full production in 2020. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector grew to $487 million at year-end, representing another record for the company. While bookings converted quarter-to-quarter due to order timing, we're updating the outlook for 2019 based on the platforms we serve and continued operating improvement. In summary, this should all result in mid-single-digit growth or better this year along with strong margins and solid bottom line performance.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I want to mention that in January, Ducommun initiated an employee stock purchase plan which provides all employees an opportunity to purchase Ducommun shares. Having employees interest aligned with those with shareholders result in a win-win environment where our growth and improving operating results reward all stakeholders now and in the future. With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,601886228,1673978,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or ASC topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on",1132,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or ASC topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings in today's 10-K and press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $164.2 million versus $142.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $17 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $8.1 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. This was due to increased shipments for key platforms such as the Boeing 737, the Airbus A320 and various missile defense programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $864 million at the end of the year versus $780 million in Q3 and as Steve mentioned, it represents a new record for the company. Just as a reminder, the company does define backlog as potential revenue and is based upon customer placed purchase orders for long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and firm delivery dates of 24 months or less. We completed our transition to ASC 606 in 2018 so in 2019, we will also be referring to our remaining performance obligations versus our historical backlog definition.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.9% in the fourth quarter versus 18.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, favorable product mix along with lower compensation benefit costs. SG&A was $22.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $20 million in 2017 with the increase primarily reflecting $0.7 million in debt refinancing fees and higher compensation and benefit cost.
The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 1.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue in gross profit as well as the impact of $4.9 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $11.8 million or 7.1% of sales and $7.3 million or 5.1% of sales for the fourth quarters of 2017 -- excuse me, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our 2018 fourth quarter restructuring activities included approximately $1.1 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $2.4 million within Electronic Systems and $0.3 million at the corporate level. As Steve mentioned, the restructuring program achieved the stated objectives and is set to deliver the benefits previously discussed. Interest expense was $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $2.8 million last year. This was due to higher utilization of our credit facility for recent acquisitions along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net income of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a tax benefit of $14.5 million in the prior year period as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income was $5.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the 2018 fourth quarter versus $4.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to $13.8 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017. Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to the Electronic Systems segments. Electronic Systems segment revenue posted revenue of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $77.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $4.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers and $6.8 million higher shipments within the commercial aerospace market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 8.9% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, electronics posted operating income -- operating margin of 10.6% for the 2018 fourth quarter and 11.9% in the prior year period.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $78.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $65.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms and $3.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 4% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin more than doubled to 10.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter versus [ 2.9% ] in 2017. This reflected the higher operating efficiencies, improved pricing and impact of our just completed restructuring program. Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue and essentially flat year-over-year due to lowering restructuring charges partially offset by $0.7 million in debt restructure costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $8.1 million in 2017. For the full year just ended, operating cash flow was $46.2 million versus $35.4 million in 2017. The improvement in cash flow reflects the improved earnings, continued diligence in managing working capital and our balance sheet is in solid shape going forward.
In November, we've refinanced our credit agreement providing for a new 7-year, $240 million senior secured term loan facility and a 5-year $100 million senior secured revolver. The new credit facilities will also allow us greater flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives but will increase our borrowing rate by about 150 to 175 basis points depending upon our leverage. Net of any unforeseen acquisitions, we anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage in 2019. In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.8 million during the fourth quarter and $17.6 million for the year which was down from $27.6 million in 2017. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support new program wins. In closing, we're very pleased with the results of our restructuring program and other initiatives designed to streamline the company and improved top line growth. Ducommun is on sound footing for continued strong operating performance in fiscal 2019. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
First, I'm happy to report that Ducommun had a strong finish to 2018 with very good results which I believe are indicative of the many actions and initiatives implemented to improve the company's operating performance. 
Fourth quarter revenue grew a robust 15% year-over-year to $164 million to reflect higher shipments across both commercial and military platforms. In addition, full year sales rose to $629 million from $558 million in 2017, an increase of over 10%. At the same time, we ended the year with a record backlog of $864 million, up more than $125 million year-over-year. 
This clearly demonstrates and shows the company's success in leveraging innovation, technology as well as our commitment to customer value. Ducommun is also fully engaged on winning new business and penetrating further into existing client platforms. At the same time, the company also generated $46 million in cash from operations and strengthened our financial flexibility by refinancing our debt, as Doug will review in a moment. 
Our restructuring action in 2018 were to streamline our operations, improve capacity utilization and increase margins, and the team delivered in all 3 areas. We removed almost 16% of total manufacturing floor space and eliminated about $14 million of annualized costs going forward, all without any customer disruptions. We also flattened our organizational structure and reduced costs while hiring new talent and investing in employee development. The team rationalized the product portfolio as well, removing low-performing programs from the company. 
In addition to the restructuring, Ducommun successfully integrated 2 accretive acquisitions that strengthened our margins, enhanced our proprietary technology and bolstered our growth profile. All these activities position the company very well for the future.
As shareholders who attended the company Investor Day in November, along with comments on previous quarterly calls, the team was also focused on operational excellence and higher returns in 2018 particularly within our structures business. The results, through a lot of hard work, were significant, with structures adjusted operating margins, in particular more than doubling to 10.7% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% a year earlier, an outstanding improvement within a short period. And everyone is proud of what we've been able to achieve. 
As we look forward to the future, the team is continually focused on product innovation, differentiation in the marketplace to ensure continued top line growth and solid margins. Whether it's our proprietary VersaCore composite technology or the company's expanding array of engineered products, Ducommun is committed to niche applications that provide high value to the industry. 
The company is in excellent shape as we begin 2019, and we're working on improving every day. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $73 million, up 13% from last year, reflecting strong sales across a variety of missile applications. 
For the total year, revenue was $277 million for the sector, representing growth of roughly 3% over 2017, driven by key platforms such as the F-18, F-35, Apache helicopter, along with the Patriot and other missile-related programs. We anticipate continued strong results within this portion of our business based on the outlook for military spending. 
I might note that the initial DoD budget for fiscal 2020 is anticipated to be at least $720 billion which is above the current budget. 
But Ducommun, we ended the year with military, space backlog just above -- or excuse me, just under $340 million, and that's near record levels. In our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $80 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are also very pleased to see a nice uptick in business with Viasat for electronics tied to in-flight connectivity. 
For 2018, as a whole, we posted commercial revenue of $304 million, representing growth of nearly 29% year-over-year. Our 737 business grew 30% in 2018, and for the first time ever, topped $100 million in sales. At the same time, we continue to ramp up content on the A320, which is a terrific story with Airbus being a fairly new commercial customer. 
We're optimistic about continued growth in 2019 once again being driven by Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320 programs as well as our business with Gulfstream and other Boeing platforms such as the 787. 
As a reminder, Boeing plans to increase 737 production to 57 a month this year from 52 in 2018 and 787 production to 14 a month from 12 last year, a real benefit for Ducommun. 
I'd also like to mention our VersaCore technology is growing in popularity, and we're on track with regards to our 10-year $200 million contract to supply and to sell components for a leading aircraft engine OEM. We will complete the industrialization plan this year with manufacturing in Guaymas, Mexico and expect to begin full production in 2020. 
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector grew to $487 million at year-end, representing another record for the company. While bookings converted quarter-to-quarter due to order timing, we're upbeat about the outlook for 2019 based on the platforms we serve and continued operating improvement. 
In summary, this should all result in mid-single-digit growth or better this year, along with strong margins and solid bottom line performance.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I want to mention that in January, Ducommun initiated an employee stock purchase plan which provides all employees an opportunity to purchase Ducommun shares. Having employees' interest aligned with those of shareholders result in a win-win environment where our growth and improving operating results reward all stakeholders now and in the future. 
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,601886228,1674103,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies",1130,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. 
As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings and today's 10-K and press release for further description of this codification versus the prior policy ASC 605. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $164.2 million versus $142.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $17 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $8.1 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. This was due to increased shipments for key platforms such as the Boeing 737, the Airbus A320 and various missile defense programs. 
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $864 million at the end of the year versus $780 million in Q3, and as Steve mentioned, it represents a new record for the company. 
Just as a reminder, the company does define backlog as potential revenue and is based upon customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and firm delivery dates of 24 months or less. We completed our transition to ASC 606 in 2018, so in 2019 we will also be referring to our remaining performance obligations versus our historical backlog definition.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.9% in the fourth quarter versus 18.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, favorable product mix, along with lower compensation benefit costs. SG&A was $22.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $20 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting $0.7 million in debt refinancing fees and higher compensation and benefit costs.
The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 1.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $4.9 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $11.8 million or 7.1% of sales and $7.3 million or 5.1% of sales for the fourth quarters of 2017 -- excuse me, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our 2018 fourth quarter restructuring activities included approximately $1.1 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $2.4 million within Electronic Systems and $0.3 million at the corporate level. As Steve mentioned, the restructuring program achieved the stated objectives and is set to deliver the benefits previously discussed. 
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $2.8 million last year. This was due to higher utilization of our credit facility for recent acquisitions along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net income of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a tax benefit of $14.5 million in the prior year period as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Adjusted net income was $5.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the 2018 fourth quarter versus $4.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to $13.8 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Electronic Systems segment revenue -- posted revenue of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $77.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $4.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers and $6.8 million higher shipments within the commercial aerospace market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 8.9% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, electronics posted operating income -- operating margin of 10.6% for the 2018 fourth quarter and 11.9% in the prior year period.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $78.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $65.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms and $3.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 4% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin more than doubled to 10.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter versus 4.9% in 2017. This reflected the higher operating efficiencies, improved pricing and impact of our just completed restructuring program. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue and essentially flat year-over-year due to lowering restructuring charges, partially offset by $0.7 million in debt restructure costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $8.1 million in 2017. For the full year just ended, operating cash flow was $46.2 million versus $35.4 million in 2017. The improvement in cash flow reflects the improved earnings, continued diligence in managing working capital, and our balance sheet is in solid shape going forward.
In November, we've refinanced our credit agreement, providing for a new 7-year, $240 million senior secured term loan facility and a 5-year $100 million senior secured revolver. The new credit facilities will also allow us greater flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives but will increase our borrowing weight by about 150 to 175 basis points depending upon our leverage. 
Net of any unforeseen acquisitions, we anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage in 2019. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.8 million during the fourth quarter and $17.6 million for the year which was down from $27.6 million in 2017. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support new program wins. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the results of our restructuring program and other initiatives designed to streamline the company and improve top line growth. Ducommun is on sound footing for continued strong operating performance in fiscal 2019. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Before turning the call over for questions, let me just once again reiterate how pleased I am with our many accomplishments in 2018. As I look forward to 2019, both the commercial and defense markets again will provide another year of great opportunities for the company. 
In Ducommun, we're focused on where we can bring the most value to the marketplace while continuing to improve our internal operations. Our structure and electronic manufacturing capabilities, along with engineered products, serve the best large narrow-body platforms in the industry. We also have very strong relationships with key customers such as Boeing, Airbus, Raytheon, Spirit Aerosystems, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies Corporation. In addition, the company's balance sheet is strong, and I believe the team is aligned as we prepare for another year of success. 
So again, I'm very proud of everything we achieved in 2018, and in closing, I want to thank our investors for their continued support.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 fourth quarter conference call. 
As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
First, I'm happy to report that Ducommun had a strong finish of 2018 with very good results which I believe are indicative of the many actions and initiatives implemented to improve the company's operating performance. 
Fourth quarter revenue grew a robust 15% year-over-year to $164 million to reflect the higher shipments across both commercial and military platforms. In addition, full year sales rose to $629 million from $558 million in 2017, an increase of over 10%. At the same time, we ended the year with a record backlog of $864 million, up more than $125 million year-over-year. 
This clearly demonstrates and shows the company's success in leveraging innovation, technology as well as our commitment to customer value. Ducommun is also fully engaged on winning new business and penetrating further into existing client platforms. At the same time, the company also generated $46 million in cash from operations and strengthened our financial flexibility by refinancing our debt, as Doug will review in a moment. 
Our restructuring action in 2018 were to streamline our operations, improve capacity utilization and increase margins, and the team delivered in all 3 areas. We removed almost 16% of total manufacturing floor space and eliminated about $14 million of annualized costs going forward, all without any customer disruptions. We also flattened our organizational structure and reduced costs while hiring new talent and investing in employee development. The team rationalized the product portfolio as well, removing low-performing programs from the company. 
In addition to the restructuring, Ducommun successfully integrated 2 accretive acquisitions that strengthened our margins, enhanced our proprietary technology and bolstered our growth profile. All these activities position the company very well for the future.
As shareholders who attended the company Investor Day in November, along with comments on previous quarterly calls, the team was also focused on operational excellence and higher returns in 2018, particularly within our structures business. The results through a lot of hard work were significant, with structures adjusted operating margins in particular more than doubling to 10.7% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% a year earlier, an outstanding improvement within a short period. And everyone is proud of what we've been able to achieve. 
As we look forward to the future, the team is continually focused on product innovation, differentiation in the marketplace to ensure continued top line growth and solid margins. Whether it's our proprietary VersaCore composite technology or the company's expanding array of engineered products, Ducommun is committed to niche applications that provide high value to the industry. 
The company is in excellent shape as we begin 2019, and we're working on improving every day. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $73 million, up 13% from last year, reflecting strong sales across a variety of missile applications. 
For the total year, revenue was $277 million for the sector, representing growth of roughly 3% over 2017, driven by key platforms such as the F-18, F-35, Apache helicopter, along with the Patriot and other missile-related programs. We anticipate continued strong results within this portion of our business based on the outlook for military spending. 
I might note that the initial DoD budget for fiscal 2020 is anticipated to be at least $720 billion, which is above the current budget. 
For Ducommun, we ended the year with military, space backlog just above -- excuse me, just under $340 million, and that's near record levels. In our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $80 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are also very pleased to see a nice uptick in business with Viasat for electronics tied to in-flight connectivity. 
For 2018 as a whole, we posted commercial revenue of $304 million, representing growth of nearly 29% year-over-year. Our 737 business grew 30% in 2018 and for the first time ever topped $100 million in sales. At the same time, we continue to ramp up content on the A320, which is a terrific story with Airbus being a fairly new commercial customer. 
We're optimistic about continued growth in 2019 once again being driven by Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320 programs as well as our business with Gulfstream and other Boeing platforms such as the 787. 
As a reminder, Boeing plans to increase 737 production to 57 a month this year from 52 in 2018 and 787 production to 14 a month from 12 last year, a real benefit for Ducommun. 
I'd also like to mention our VersaCore technology is growing in popularity, and we're on track with regards to our 10-year $200 million contract to supply and to sell components for a leading aircraft engine OEM. We will complete the industrialization plan this year with manufacturing in Guaymas, Mexico, and expect to begin full production in 2020. 
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector grew to $487 million at year-end, representing another record for the company. While bookings can vary quarter-to-quarter due to order timing, we're upbeat about the outlook for 2019 based on the platforms we serve and continued operating improvement. 
In summary, this should all result in mid-single-digit growth or better this year, along with strong margins and solid bottom line performance.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I want to mention that in January Ducommun initiated an employee stock purchase plan which provides all employees an opportunity to purchase Ducommun shares. Having employees' interest aligned with those of shareholders results in a win-win environment where our growth and improving operating results reward all stakeholders now and in the future. 
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,601886228,1677060,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve. And good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies",1131,"Thank you, Steve. And good day, everyone. 
As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings and today's 10-K and press release for a further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $164.2 million versus $142.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $17 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $8.1 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. This was due to increased shipments for key platforms such as the Boeing 737, the Airbus A320 and various missile defense programs. 
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $864 million at the end of the year versus $780 million in Q3, and as Steve mentioned, it represents a new record for the company. 
Just as a reminder, the company does define backlog as potential revenue and is based upon customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and firm delivery dates of 24 months or less. We completed our transition to ASC 606 in 2018, so in 2019, we will also be referring to our remaining performance obligations versus our historical backlog definition.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.9% in the fourth quarter versus 18.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, favorable product mix, along with lower compensation benefit costs. SG&A was $22.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $20 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting $0.7 million in debt refinancing fees and higher compensation and benefit costs.
The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 1.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $4.9 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $11.8 million or 7.1% of sales and $7.3 million or 5.1% of sales for the fourth quarters of 2017 -- excuse me, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our 2018 fourth quarter restructuring activities included approximately $1.1 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $2.4 million within Electronic Systems and $0.3 million at the corporate level. As Steve mentioned, the restructuring program achieved the stated objectives and is set to deliver the benefits previously discussed. 
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $2.8 million last year. This was due to higher utilization of our credit facility for recent acquisitions along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net income of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a tax benefit of $14.5 million in the prior year period as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Adjusted net income was $5.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the 2018 fourth quarter versus $4.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to $13.8 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Electronic Systems segment revenue -- posted revenue of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $77.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $4.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers and $6.8 million higher shipments within the commercial aerospace market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 8.9% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, electronics posted operating income -- operating margin of 10.6% for the 2018 fourth quarter and 11.9% in the prior year period.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $78.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $65.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and $3.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 4% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin more than doubled to 10.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter versus 4.9% in 2017. This reflected the higher operating efficiencies, improved pricing and impact of our just completed restructuring program. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue and essentially flat year-over-year due to lowering restructuring charges, partially offset by $0.7 million in debt restructure costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $8.1 million in 2017. For the full year just ended, operating cash flow was $46.2 million versus $35.4 million in 2017. The improvement in cash flow reflects the improved earnings, continued diligence in managing working capital, and our balance sheet is in solid shape going forward.
In November, we've refinanced our credit agreement, providing for a new 7-year, $240 million senior secured term loan facility and a 5-year $100 million senior secured revolver. The new credit facilities will also allow us greater flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives but will increase our borrowing weight by about 150 to 175 basis points depending upon our leverage. 
Net of any unforeseen acquisitions, we anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage in 2019. 
In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.8 million during the fourth quarter and $17.6 million for the year, which was down from $27.6 million in 2017. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support new program wins. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the results of our restructuring program and other initiatives designed to streamline the company and improve top line growth. Ducommun is on sound footing for continued strong operating performance in fiscal 2019. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

In Ducommun, we're focused on where we can bring the most value to the marketplace while continuing to improve our internal operations. Our structure and electronic manufacturing capabilities, along with engineered products, serve the best large narrow-body platforms in the industry. We also have very strong relationships with key customers such as Boeing, Airbus, Raytheon, Spirit Aerosystems, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies Corporation. In addition, the company's balance sheet is strong, and I believe the team is aligned as we prepare for another year of success. 
So again, I'm very proud of everything we achieved in 2018. And in closing, I want to thank our investors for their continued support.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 fourth quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
First, I'm happy to report that Ducommun had a strong finish of 2018 with very good results which I believe are indicative of the many actions and initiatives implemented to improve the company's operating performance. 
Fourth quarter revenue grew a robust 15% year-over-year to $164 million to reflect the higher shipments across both commercial and military platforms. In addition, full year sales rose to $629 million from $558 million in 2017, an increase of over 10%. At the same time, we ended the year with a record backlog of $864 million, up more than $125 million year-over-year. 
This clearly demonstrates and shows the company's success in leveraging innovation, technology as well as our commitment to customer value. Ducommun is also fully engaged on winning new business and penetrating further into existing client platforms. At the same time, the company also generated $46 million in cash from operations and strengthened our financial flexibility by refinancing our debt, as Doug will review in a moment. 
Our restructuring action in 2018 were to streamline our operations, improve capacity utilization and increase margins, and the team delivered in all 3 areas. We removed almost 16% of total manufacturing floor space and eliminated about $14 million of annualized costs going forward, all without any customer disruptions. We also flattened our organizational structure and reduced costs while hiring new talent and investing in employee development. The team rationalized the product portfolio as well, removing low-performing programs from the company. 
In addition to the restructuring, Ducommun successfully integrated 2 accretive acquisitions that strengthened our margins, enhanced our proprietary technology and bolstered our growth profile. All these activities position the company very well for the future.
As shareholders who attended the company Investor Day in November, along with comments on previous quarterly calls, the team was also focused on operational excellence and higher returns in 2018, particularly within our structures business. The results through a lot of hard work were significant, with structures adjusted operating margins in particular more than doubling to 10.7% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% a year earlier, an outstanding improvement within a short period. And everyone is proud of what we've been able to achieve. 
As we look forward to the future, the team is continually focused on product innovation, differentiation in the marketplace to ensure continued top line growth and solid margins. Whether it's our proprietary VersaCore composite technology or the company's expanding array of engineered products, Ducommun is committed to niche applications that provide high value to the industry. The company is in excellent shape as we begin 2019, and we're working on improving every day. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $73 million, up 13% from last year, reflecting strong sales across a variety of missile applications. 
For the total year, revenue was $277 million for the sector, representing growth of roughly 3% over 2017, driven by key platforms such as the F-18, F-35, Apache helicopter, along with the Patriot and other missile-related programs. We anticipate continued strong results within this portion of our business based on the outlook for military spending. I might note that the initial DoD budget for fiscal 2020 is anticipated to be at least $720 billion, which is above the current budget. 
For Ducommun, we ended the year with military, space backlog just above -- excuse me, just under $340 million, and that's near record levels. In our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $80 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are also very pleased to see a nice uptick in business with Viasat for electronics tied to in-flight connectivity. 
For 2018 as a whole, we posted commercial revenue of $304 million, representing growth of nearly 29% year-over-year. Our 737 business grew 30% in 2018 and for the first time ever topped $100 million in sales. At the same time, we continue to ramp up content on the A320, which is a terrific story with Airbus being a fairly new commercial customer. 
We're optimistic about continued growth in 2019 once again being driven by Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320 programs as well as our business with Gulfstream and other Boeing platforms such as the 787. 
As a reminder, Boeing plans to increase 737 production to 57 a month this year from 52 in 2018 and 787 production to 14 a month from 12 last year, a real benefit for Ducommun. 
I'd also like to mention our VersaCore technology is growing in popularity, and we're on track with regards to our 10-year $200 million contract to supply and to sell components for a leading aircraft engine OEM. We will complete the industrialization plan this year with manufacturing in Guaymas, Mexico, and expect to begin full production in 2020. 
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector grew to $487 million at year-end, representing another record for the company. While bookings can vary quarter-to-quarter due to order timing, we're upbeat about the outlook for 2019 based on the platforms we serve and continued operating improvement. 
In summary, this should all result in mid-single-digit growth or better this year, along with strong margins and solid bottom line performance.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I want to mention that in January Ducommun initiated an employee stock purchase plan which provides all employees an opportunity to purchase Ducommun shares. Having employees' interest aligned with those of shareholders results in a win-win environment where our growth and improving operating results reward all stakeholders now and in the future. 
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,601886228,1678412,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies o",1131,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings and today's 10-K and press release for a further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $164.2 million versus $142.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $17 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $8.1 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. This was due to increased shipments for key platforms such as the Boeing 737, the Airbus A320 and various missile defense programs. 
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $864 million at the end of the year versus $780 million in Q3, and as Steve mentioned, it represents a new record for the company. 
Just as a reminder, the company does define backlog as potential revenue and is based upon customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and firm delivery dates of 24 months or less. We completed our transition to ASC 606 in 2018, so in 2019, we will also be referring to our remaining performance obligations versus our historical backlog definition.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.9% in the fourth quarter versus 18.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, favorable product mix, along with lower compensation benefit costs. SG&A was $22.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $20 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting $0.7 million in debt refinancing fees and higher compensation and benefit costs.
The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 1.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $4.9 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $11.8 million or 7.1% of sales and $7.3 million or 5.1% of sales for the fourth quarters of 2017 -- excuse me, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our 2018 fourth quarter restructuring activities included approximately $1.1 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $2.4 million within Electronic Systems and $0.3 million at the corporate level. As Steve mentioned, the restructuring program achieved the stated objectives and is set to deliver the benefits previously discussed. 
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $2.8 million last year. This was due to higher utilization of our credit facility for recent acquisitions along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net income of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a tax benefit of $14.5 million in the prior year period as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Adjusted net income was $5.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the 2018 fourth quarter versus $4.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to $13.8 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Electronic Systems segment revenue -- posted revenue of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $77.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $4.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers and $6.8 million higher shipments within the commercial aerospace market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 8.9% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, electronics posted operating income -- operating margin of 10.6% for the 2018 fourth quarter and 11.9% in the prior year period.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $78.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $65.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and $3.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 4% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin more than doubled to 10.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter versus 4.9% in 2017. This reflected the higher operating efficiencies, improved pricing and impact of our just completed restructuring program. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue and essentially flat year-over-year due to lowering restructuring charges, partially offset by $0.7 million in debt restructure costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $8.1 million in 2017. For the full year just ended, operating cash flow was $46.2 million versus $35.4 million in 2017. The improvement in cash flow reflects the improved earnings, continued diligence in managing working capital, and our balance sheet is in solid shape going forward.
In November, we've refinanced our credit agreement, providing for a new 7-year, $240 million senior secured term loan facility and a 5-year $100 million senior secured revolver. The new credit facilities will also allow us greater flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives but will increase our borrowing weight by about 150 to 175 basis points depending upon our leverage. 
Net of any unforeseen acquisitions, we anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage in 2019. In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.8 million during the fourth quarter and $17.6 million for the year, which was down from $27.6 million in 2017. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support new program wins. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the results of our restructuring program and other initiatives designed to streamline the company and improve top line growth. Ducommun is on sound footing for continued strong operating performance in fiscal 2019. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

In Ducommun, we're focused on where we can bring the most value to the marketplace while continuing to improve our internal operations.

We also have very strong relationships with key customers such as Boeing, Airbus, Raytheon, Spirit Aerosystems, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies Corporation. In addition, the company's balance sheet is strong, and I believe the team is aligned as we prepare for another year of success. So again, I'm very proud of everything we achieved in 2018.

Certain statements today that are not historical facts, including any statements as to future market conditions, results of operations, our restructuring plans and financial projections, are forward-looking statements under the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, therefore, are prospective. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurances that such expectations will prove to be correct. In addition, the estimates of future operating results are based on the company's current business, which is subject to change. Particular risks facing Ducommun include, among others, the cyclicality of our end-use markets, the level of U.S. government defense spending, legal and regulatory risks, management changes, the cost of expansion and acquisitions, and competition. These risks and others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and our forward-looking statements are subject to those risks. 
Statements made during this call are only as of the time made, and we do not intend to update any statements made in this presentation except if and as required by regulatory authorities. In addition, all comparisons on today's call recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606, covering revenue recognition policies on current results. Please see the company's filings for further description of this change and a comparison to the prior policy, ASC 605. This call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures referenced on this call to the most similar GAAP measures.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2018 fourth quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an overview of recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
First, I'm happy to report that Ducommun had a strong finish of 2018 with very good results which I believe are indicative of the many actions and initiatives implemented to improve the company's operating performance. 
Fourth quarter revenue grew a robust 15% year-over-year to $164 million to reflect the higher shipments across both commercial and military platforms. In addition, full year sales rose to $629 million from $558 million in 2017, an increase of over 10%. At the same time, we ended the year with a record backlog of $864 million, up more than $125 million year-over-year. 
This clearly demonstrates and shows the company's success in leveraging innovation, technology as well as our commitment to customer value. Ducommun is also fully engaged on winning new business and penetrating further into existing client platforms. At the same time, the company also generated $46 million in cash from operations and strengthened our financial flexibility by refinancing our debt, as Doug will review in a moment. 
Our restructuring action in 2018 were to streamline our operations, improve capacity utilization and increase margins, and the team delivered in all 3 areas. We removed almost 16% of total manufacturing floor space and eliminated about $14 million of annualized costs going forward, all without any customer disruptions. We also flattened our organizational structure and reduced costs while hiring new talent and investing in employee development. The team rationalized the product portfolio as well, removing low-performing programs from the company. 
In addition to the restructuring, Ducommun successfully integrated 2 accretive acquisitions that strengthened our margins, enhanced our proprietary technology and bolstered our growth profile. All these activities position the company very well for the future.
As shareholders who attended the company Investor Day in November, along with comments on previous quarterly calls, the team was also focused on operational excellence and higher returns in 2018, particularly within our structures business. The results through a lot of hard work were significant, with structures adjusted operating margins in particular more than doubling to 10.7% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% a year earlier, an outstanding improvement within a short period. And everyone is proud of what we've been able to achieve. 
As we look forward to the future, the team is continually focused on product innovation, differentiation in the marketplace to ensure continued top line growth and solid margins. Whether it's our proprietary VersaCore composite technology or the company's expanding array of engineered products, Ducommun is committed to niche applications that provide high value to the industry. The company is in excellent shape as we begin 2019, and we're working on improving every day. 
Now let me provide you some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted fourth quarter revenue of $73 million, up 13% from last year, reflecting strong sales across a variety of missile applications. 
For the total year, revenue was $277 million for the sector, representing growth of roughly 3% over 2017, driven by key platforms such as the F-18, F-35, Apache helicopter, along with the Patriot and other missile-related programs. We anticipate continued strong results within this portion of our business based on the outlook for military spending. I might note that the initial DoD budget for fiscal 2020 is anticipated to be at least $720 billion, which is above the current budget. 
For Ducommun, we ended the year with military, space backlog just above -- excuse me, just under $340 million, and that's near record levels. In our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter sales rose approximately 27% year-over-year to $80 million. We once again saw significant growth across large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft, reflecting higher build rates for the Boeing 737 platforms and the Airbus A320 family. We are also very pleased to see a nice uptick in business with Viasat for electronics tied to in-flight connectivity. 
For 2018 as a whole, we posted commercial revenue of $304 million, representing growth of nearly 29% year-over-year. Our 737 business grew 30% in 2018 and for the first time ever topped $100 million in sales. At the same time, we continue to ramp up content on the A320, which is a terrific story with Airbus being a fairly new commercial customer. 
We're optimistic about continued growth in 2019 once again being driven by Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320 programs as well as our business with Gulfstream and other Boeing platforms such as the 787. 
As a reminder, Boeing plans to increase 737 production to 57 a month this year from 52 in 2018 and 787 production to 14 a month from 12 last year, a real benefit for Ducommun. 
I'd also like to mention our VersaCore technology is growing in popularity, and we're on track with regards to our 10-year $200 million contract to supply and to sell components for a leading aircraft engine OEM. We will complete the industrialization plan this year with manufacturing in Guaymas, Mexico, and expect to begin full production in 2020. 
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector grew to $487 million at year-end, representing another record for the company. While bookings can vary quarter-to-quarter due to order timing, we're upbeat about the outlook for 2019 based on the platforms we serve and continued operating improvement. 
In summary, this should all result in mid-single-digit growth or better this year, along with strong margins and solid bottom line performance.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I want to mention that in January Ducommun initiated an employee stock purchase plan which provides all employees an opportunity to purchase Ducommun shares. Having employees' interest aligned with those of shareholders results in a win-win environment where our growth and improving operating results reward all stakeholders now and in the future. 
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,601886228,1696613,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies o",1131,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, my comparisons on today's call are on a year-over-year basis and recognize the implementation of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, topic 606 covering revenue recognition policies on current year results. Please see the company's filings and today's 10-K and press release for a further description of this codification versus the prior policy, ASC 605. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $164.2 million versus $142.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This performance primarily reflects $17 million of higher sales to the company's commercial aerospace customers and $8.1 million of greater revenue within the military and space sector. This was due to increased shipments for key platforms such as the Boeing 737, the Airbus A320 and various missile defense programs. 
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $864 million at the end of the year versus $780 million in Q3, and as Steve mentioned, it represents a new record for the company. 
Just as a reminder, the company does define backlog as potential revenue and is based upon customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and firm delivery dates of 24 months or less. We completed our transition to ASC 606 in 2018, so in 2019, we will also be referring to our remaining performance obligations versus our historical backlog definition.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.9% in the fourth quarter versus 18.1% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes, favorable product mix, along with lower compensation benefit costs. SG&A was $22.5 million in the fourth quarter versus $20 million in 2017, with the increase primarily reflecting $0.7 million in debt refinancing fees and higher compensation and benefit costs.
The company reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $6.3 million or 3.8% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 1.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $4.9 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $11.8 million or 7.1% of sales and $7.3 million or 5.1% of sales for the fourth quarters of 2017 -- excuse me, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our 2018 fourth quarter restructuring activities included approximately $1.1 million of charges within our Structural Systems segment, $2.4 million within Electronic Systems and $0.3 million at the corporate level. As Steve mentioned, the restructuring program achieved the stated objectives and is set to deliver the benefits previously discussed. 
Interest expense was $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $2.8 million last year. This was due to higher utilization of our credit facility for recent acquisitions along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $0.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net income of $9.5 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a tax benefit of $14.5 million in the prior year period as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Adjusted net income was $5.2 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the 2018 fourth quarter versus $4.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $19.4 million or 11.8% of revenue, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to $13.8 million or 9.7% of revenue for the comparable period in 2017. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Electronic Systems segment revenue -- posted revenue of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $77.2 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $4.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers and $6.8 million higher shipments within the commercial aerospace market. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $7.5 million or 8.7% of revenue versus $6.9 million or 8.9% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, electronics posted operating income -- operating margin of 10.6% for the 2018 fourth quarter and 11.9% in the prior year period.
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $78.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $65.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $10.2 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and $3.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $5.7 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million or negative 4% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of ASC 606, structures adjusted operating margin more than doubled to 10.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter versus 4.9% in 2017. This reflected the higher operating efficiencies, improved pricing and impact of our just completed restructuring program. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter was $6.9 million or 4.2% of revenue and essentially flat year-over-year due to lowering restructuring charges, partially offset by $0.7 million in debt restructure costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus $8.1 million in 2017. For the full year just ended, operating cash flow was $46.2 million versus $35.4 million in 2017. The improvement in cash flow reflects the improved earnings, continued diligence in managing working capital, and our balance sheet is in solid shape going forward.
In November, we've refinanced our credit agreement, providing for a new 7-year, $240 million senior secured term loan facility and a 5-year $100 million senior secured revolver. The new credit facilities will also allow us greater flexibility to execute our strategic initiatives but will increase our borrowing weight by about 150 to 175 basis points depending upon our leverage. 
Net of any unforeseen acquisitions, we anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage in 2019. In terms of CapEx, we spent $4.8 million during the fourth quarter and $17.6 million for the year, which was down from $27.6 million in 2017. We anticipate spending approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support new program wins. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the results of our restructuring program and other initiatives designed to streamline the company and improve top line growth. Ducommun is on sound footing for continued strong operating performance in fiscal 2019. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

In Ducommun, we're focused on where we can bring the most value to the marketplace while continuing to improve our internal operations. Our structure and electronic manufacturing capabilities, along with engineered products, serve the best large narrow-body platforms in the industry. We also have very strong relationships with key customers such as Boeing, Airbus, Raytheon, Spirit Aerosystems, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies Corporation. In addition, the company's balance sheet is strong, and I believe the team is aligned as we prepare for another year of success. So again, I'm very proud of everything we achieved in 2018.

Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for 2019 first quarter call.  As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments in the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.  
I'm very pleased to announce we posted a strong start of fiscal 2019 with overall performance surpassing expectation across the board.  First quarter revenue grew roughly 15% year-over-year to $172.6 million driven by continued strong demand across a number of key commercial platforms, particularly the Boeing 737 where revenue grew sharply versus 2018.  
737 is a very important program for us as well as our industry, and we are committed to serving Boeing as it deals with the current serious situation.  As reported, Boeing is actively engaged in fixing the issues and working with all involved, including many regulators, to get its plane back in the air as soon as possible.  
For Ducommun, let me remind everyone that roughly 40% of our content on the 737 platform goes through Spirit Aerosystems  in Wichita, Kansas, which is not cutting current production rates as previously announced.  For Boeing direct, we are working closely with them and balancing support of their current rate requirements while also ensuring readiness, risk mitigation and alignment to the planned forward rates.  In addition, our team is actively engaged with Boeing and adjusting current purchase orders as required.  
Due to our diverse customer base across Ducommun and the broader array of platforms served, we continue to anticipate 5% to 7% revenue growth across our commercial aerospace programs for the next 3 to 4 quarters.  The longer-term outlook after that is dependent on the timing of the 737 MAX returning to service and Boeing's new production schedule.  
We ended the quarter with another record backlog of $884 million and a book to bill of 111%, again, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships, the value we provide and the technology offerings.  In addition, our work to improve profitability continued.  Overall gross margins rose an impressive 290 basis points year-over-year to 20.7%.  Our operating margins reached 7.4% while we posted $21.7 million of adjusted EBITDA.  
Results are particularly strong within our structures segment where operating margins reached 11.9% to the many actions taken in 2018 to streamline the business.  The segment also benefited from higher overall production rates, additional content, lower scrap rates and the associated economies of scale.  
In Q1, the company continued to build our innovation processes and a company culture based on Lean cultures.  We've identified additional future operational improvements and ways to reduce working capital, particularly with regards to scrap and inventory.  We are underway to significantly improve those areas.  Assessing the business and optimizing all our resources is something done continuously at Ducommun even as we invest in our technology, operations and most importantly our people to become world-class at everything we do at the company.  
Our 2 recent acquisitions are also adding value to the organization and helping our growth trajectory.  We continue to look at additional opportunities that can leverage our applications and strengthen our proprietary technologies offerings to the industry.  I think we have also demonstrated to investors in the marketplace a strong track record of integration and driving value once acquired, and look forward to more activity in the future.  
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs.  Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $76.7 million, up 21% from last year primarily reflecting stronger sales across a variety of missile applications.  The significant growth across such programs is the Patriot.  We also noted positive trends with certain military helicopter platforms and the very important F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  Other areas of business were impacted by order timing and transfer of production to Huntsville from our Phoenix facility, but we anticipate higher shipments in the coming quarter.  The overall market for military applications looks bright, given our proposed budget that includes increased spending from various missile programs along with solid demand for the F-16, F-18 and F-35 as well as certain helicopter platforms. We ended the quarter with the military and space backlog around $347 million, near record levels.  
At our commercial aerospace operation -- operations first quarter sales rose approximately 16% year-over-year to $85.5 million.  As I mentioned just a moment ago, growth was primarily fueled by large fixed wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family.  We also saw some nice double-digit growth on the Boeing 787 platform driven by an increase in build rate from 12 to 14 airplanes per month.  In total, our large fixed wing business grew 25% year-over-year.  In addition, we are experiencing uptick in our regional business driven by Gulfstream, another OEM, where we expect further room for content expansion.  
I do want to provide an update on our VersaCore Composite technology as well.  The team remains on track with our 10-year $200 million contract to supply components and are preparing our Mexico facility to begin full production in 2020.  Wins such as this and contributions from our recent acquisitions strengthen the outlook for Ducommun, while diversifying our base of business.
The backlog with our commercial aerospace grew to just under $500 million at the end of the quarter, representing another new record for the company.  We remain upbeat about the outlook for Ducommun's commercial business this year, given the platforms we serve, our customer relationships and the value provided through our technology and breadth of product offerings.  
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail.  Doug?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.  I'll begin with details of our overall results.  
Revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $172.6 million versus $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.  This performance includes $13.1 million of greater sales to the military and space sector primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs, and $11.9 million of higher revenue with commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320.  
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $884 million as of March 30, up slightly from the start of the year-end and as Steve mentioned, a new record for the company.  As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.  
Moving to gross profit.  Our gross margin was 20.7% in the first quarter versus 17.8% in the prior year's comparable period.  The increase of 290 basis points year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes and favorable product mix along with many streamlining measures taken last year as Steve discussed.  
SG&A was $22.8 million in the first quarter versus $19.3 million in 2018 with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs.  
The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $12.8 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue in the prior year period.  The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $2.2 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A.  On an adjusted basis, operating income was $7.4 million or 4.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.  
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $2.9 million last year, and this was due to the greater utilization of credit facility for the certified thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018 along with higher interest rates.  
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018.  The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by $8.9 million of higher gross profit.  Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $2.2 million offset by a $3.5 million increase in SG&A, $1.5 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.3 million.  Adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was $21.7 million or 12.6% of revenue compared to $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 50%.  
Now let me turn to the segment results.  Turning to Electronic Systems segment.  Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $82.4 million in the prior year period.  These results reflect an $8.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, $3.8 million of lower shipments within the commercial aerospace market reflecting order timing, and $2.9 million of lower sales in the industrial end-use markets as expected.  Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenue versus $5.7 million or 7% of revenue in the prior year period.  Excluding the restructuring charges last year, electronics adjusted operating margin was 7.6% for the 2018 first quarter.  The year-over-year margin improvement was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.  
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $88.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $68 million last year.  This year-over-year increase was due to $15.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and $4.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets.  Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue last year.  Excluding the restructuring charges, structures adjusted operating margin was 8.7% for the 2018 first quarter.  The year-over-year margin improvement reflects higher operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.  
CG&A, corporate general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $4.9 million or 3.2% of revenue last year.  The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $1.6 million.
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources.  We used $1.7 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2019 compared with generating $10.3 million of operating cash during the first quarter 2018.  The change year-over-year was due to a decrease in accrued and other liabilities for incentive compensation payments that were substantially larger in the current quarter compared to 2018 Q1, and this was partially offset by higher net income.  We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019, and excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage this year.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the first quarter and expect to spend approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support our new program wins.  
We're very proud of the first quarter performance, which puts us on track for a very solid year ahead.  With that, let me turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks.  Steve?"

First, the quarter's performance really reflects a lot of the initiatives we implemented over the last 2 years, so I'm absolutely thrilled.  I set up to streamline the organization, bringing new talent, focus the team to provide excellent customer service while vastly improving the bottom line results.  
Given the current outlook for the diverse array of platforms we serve, both the defense and commercial aerospace sectors, we expect the company will continue to expand its market share, post solid margins and drive solid top line growth.  In addition, Ducommun will also work as in the past to enhance and optimize our product portfolio to provide innovative value-added applications and ensure repeat business, attractive results and a solid return for our shareholders.

Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call.  As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail",940,"Okay.  Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call.  As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
I'm very pleased to announce that we posted a strong start to fiscal 2019 with our overall performance surpassing expectations across the board.  First quarter revenue grew roughly 15% year-over-year to $172.6 million driven by continued strong demand across a number of key commercial platforms, particularly the Boeing 737 where revenue grew sharply versus 2018.
737 is a very important program for us as well as our industry, and we are committed to serving Boeing as it deals with current serious situation.  As reported, Boeing is actively engaged in fixing the issues and working with all involved including many regulators to get its plane back in the air as soon as possible.  
For Ducommun, let me remind everyone that roughly 40% of our content on the 737 platform goes through Spirit Aerosystems based in Wichita, Kansas, which is not cutting current production rates as previously announced.  For Boeing direct, we are working closely with them and balancing support of their current rate requirements while also ensuring readiness, risk mitigation and alignment to the planned forward rates.  In addition, our team is actively engaged with Boeing in adjusting current purchase orders as required. 
Due to our diverse customer base across Ducommun and the broader array of platforms served, we continue to anticipate 5% to 7% revenue growth across our commercial aerospace programs for the next 3 to 4 quarters.  The longer-term outlook after that is dependent on the timing of the 737 MAX returning to service and Boeing's new production schedule.
We ended the quarter with another record backlog of $884 million and a book-to-bill of 111%, again, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships, the value we provide and the technology offerings.  In addition, our work to improve profitability continued.  Overall gross margins rose an impressive 290 basis points year-over-year to 20.7%.  Our op margin reached 7.4% while we posted $21.7 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Results are particularly strong within our Structures segment where operating margins reached 11.9% due to the many actions taken in 2018 to streamline the business.  The segment also benefited from higher overall production rates, additional content, lower scrap rates and the associated economies of scale.
In Q1, the company continued to build our innovation processes and a company culture based on lean cultures.  We've identified additional future operational improvements and ways to reduce working capital, particularly with regards to scrap and inventory.  We are underway to significantly improve those areas.  Assessing the business and optimizing all our resources is something done continuously at Ducommun, even as we invest in our technology, operations and most importantly our people to become world-class at everything we do at the company.
Our 2 recent acquisitions are also adding value to the organization and helping our growth trajectory.  We continue to look at additional opportunities that can leverage our applications and strengthen our proprietary technologies offerings to the industry.  I think we have also demonstrated to investors in the marketplace a strong track record of integration and driving value once acquired. I look forward to more activity in the future.  
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs.  Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $76.7 million, up 21% from last year primarily reflecting stronger sales across a variety of missile applications.  Aside from significant growth across such programs as the Patriot, we also noted positive trends with certain military helicopter platforms and the very important F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  Other areas of our defense business were impacted by order timing and transfer of production to Huntsville from our Phoenix facility, but we anticipate higher shipments in the coming quarter.  The overall market for our military applications looks bright, given our proposed budget that includes increased spending from various missile programs along with solid demand for the F-15, F-18 and F-35 as well as certain helicopter platforms. We ended the quarter with the military and space backlog of around $347 million, near record levels.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose approximately 16% year-over-year to $85.5 million.  As I mentioned a moment ago, growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft-s such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 family.  We also saw some nice double-digit growth on the Boeing 787 platform driven by an increase in build rate from 12 to 14 aeroplanes per month.  In total, our large fixed-wing business grew 25% year-over-year.  In addition, we're experiencing an uptick in our regional business -- jet business driven by Gulfstream, another OEM, where we expect further room for content expansion.
I do want to provide an update on our VersaCore Composite technology as well.  The team remains on track with our 10-year $200 million contract to supply missile components and are preparing our Guaymas, Mexico facility to begin full production in 2020.  Wins such as this and contributions from our recent acquisitions strengthen the outlook for Ducommun, while diversifying our base of business.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace grew to just under $500 million at the end of the quarter, representing another new record for the company.  We remain upbeat about the outlook for Ducommun's commercial business this year, given the platforms we serve, our customer relationships and the value provided through our technology and breadth of product offerings.  
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.  I'll begin with details of our overall results.  
Revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $172.6 million versus $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.  This performance includes $13.1 million of greater sales to the military and space sector primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $11.9 million of higher revenue with commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320.  
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $884 million as of March 30, up slightly from the start of the year-end and as Steve mentioned, a new record for the company.  As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit.  Our gross margin was 20.7% in the first quarter versus 17.8% in the prior year's comparable period.  The increase of 290 basis points year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes and favorable product mix along with the many streamlining measures taken last year, as Steve discussed.  
SG&A was $22.8 million in the first quarter versus $19.3 million in 2018 with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $12.8 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue in the prior year period.  The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $2.2 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A.  On an adjusted basis, operating income was $7.4 million or 4.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.  
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $2.9 million last year, and this was due to the greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018 along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018.  The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by $8.9 million of higher gross profit.  Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $2.2 million, offset by a $3.5 million increase in SG&A, $1.5 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.3 million.  Adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was $21.7 million or 12.6% of revenue compared to $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 50%.
Now let me turn to the segment results.  Turning to Electronic Systems segment.  Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $82.4 million in the prior year period.  These results reflect an $8.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, $3.8 million of lower shipments within the commercial aerospace market reflecting order timing and $2.9 million of lower sales in the industrial end-use market as expected.  Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenue versus $5.7 million or 7% of revenue in the prior year period.  Excluding the restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 7.6% for the 2018 first quarter.  The year-over-year margin improvement was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.  
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $88.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $68 million last year.  This year-over-year increase was due to $15.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms and $4.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets.  
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue last year.  Excluding the restructuring charges, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 8.7% for the 2018 first quarter.  The year-over-year margin improvement reflects higher operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.
CG&A, corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $4.9 million or 3.2% of revenue last year.  The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $1.6 million.
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources.  We used $1.7 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2019 compared with generating $10.3 million of operating cash during the first quarter of 2018.  The change year-over-year was due to a decrease in accrued and other liabilities for incentive compensation payments that were substantially larger in the current quarter compared to 2018 Q1, and this was partially offset by higher net income.  We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019, and excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the first quarter and expect to spend approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support our new program wins.
We're very proud of the first quarter performance, which puts us on track for a very solid year ahead.  With that, I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

First, the quarter's performance really reflects a lot of the initiatives we implemented over the last 2 years, so I'm absolutely thrilled. I set out to streamline the organization, bringing new talent, focus the team on providing excellent customer service while vastly improving the bottom line results.
Given the current outlook for the diverse array of platforms we serve, both the defense and commercial aerospace sectors, we expect the company will continue expanding its market share, post solid margins and drive solid top line growth.  In addition, Ducommun will also work, as in the past, to enhance and optimize our product portfolio to provide innovative, value-added applications that ensure repeat business, attractive results and a solid return for our shareholders.  
So in closing, I think we're off to a great start in 2019.  And as always, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support.

Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call.  As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail",940,"Okay.  Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call.  As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
I'm very pleased to announce that we posted a strong start to fiscal 2019 with our overall performance surpassing expectations across the board.  First quarter revenue grew roughly 15% year-over-year to $172.6 million driven by continued strong demand across a number of key commercial platforms, particularly the Boeing 737 where revenue grew sharply versus 2018.
737 is a very important program for us as well as our industry, and we are committed to serving Boeing as it deals with current serious situation.  As reported, Boeing is actively engaged in fixing the issues and working with all involved including many regulators to get its plane back in the air as soon as possible.  
For Ducommun, let me remind everyone that roughly 40% of our content on the 737 platform goes through Spirit Aerosystems based in Wichita, Kansas, which is not cutting current production rates as previously announced.  For Boeing direct, we are working closely with them and balancing support of their current rate requirements while also ensuring readiness, risk mitigation and alignment to the planned forward rates.  In addition, our team is actively engaged with Boeing in adjusting current purchase orders as required. 
Due to our diverse customer base across Ducommun and the broader array of platforms served, we continue to anticipate 5% to 7% revenue growth across our commercial aerospace programs for the next 3 to 4 quarters.  The longer-term outlook after that is dependent on the timing of the 737 MAX returning to service and Boeing's new production schedule.
We ended the quarter with another record backlog of $884 million and a book-to-bill of 111%, again, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships, the value we provide and the technology offerings.  In addition, our work to improve profitability continued.  Overall gross margins rose an impressive 290 basis points year-over-year to 20.7%.  Our op margin reached 7.4% while we posted $21.7 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Results are particularly strong within our Structures segment where operating margins reached 11.9% due to the many actions taken in 2018 to streamline the business.  The segment also benefited from higher overall production rates, additional content, lower scrap rates and the associated economies of scale.
In Q1, the company continued to build our innovation processes and a company culture, based on lean cultures.  We've identified additional future operational improvements and ways to reduce working capital, particularly with regards to scrap and inventory.  We are underway to significantly improve those areas.  Assessing the business and optimizing all our resources is something done continuously at Ducommun, even as we invest in our technology, operations, and most importantly, our people, to become world-class at everything we do at the company.
Our 2 recent acquisitions are also adding value to the organization and helping our growth trajectory.  We continue to look at additional opportunities that can leverage our applications and strengthen our proprietary technologies offerings to the industry.  I think we have also demonstrated to investors in the marketplace a strong track record of integration and driving value once acquired. I look forward to more activity in the future.  
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs.  Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $76.7 million, up 21% from last year, primarily reflecting stronger sales across a variety of missile applications.  Aside from significant growth across such programs as the Patriot, we also noted positive trends with certain military helicopter platforms and the very important F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  Other areas of our defense business were impacted by order timing and transfer of production to Huntsville from our Phoenix facility, but we anticipate higher shipments in the coming quarter.  The overall market for our military applications looks bright, given our proposed budget that includes increased spending from various missile programs along with solid demand for the F-15, F-18 and F-35 as well as certain helicopter platforms. We ended the quarter with the military and space backlog of around $347 million, near record levels.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose approximately 16% year-over-year to $85.5 million.  As I mentioned a moment ago, growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft-s such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 family.  We also saw some nice double-digit growth on the Boeing 787 platform driven by an increase in build rate from 12 to 14 aeroplanes per month.  In total, our large fixed-wing business grew 25% year-over-year.  In addition, we're experiencing an uptick in our regional business -- jet business driven by Gulfstream, another OEM, where we expect further room for content expansion.
I do want to provide an update on our VersaCore Composite technology as well.  The team remains on track with our 10-year $200 million contract to supply missile components and are preparing our Guaymas, Mexico facility to begin full production in 2020.  Wins such as this and contributions from our recent acquisitions strengthen the outlook for Ducommun, while diversifying our base of business.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace grew to just under $500 million at the end of the quarter, representing another new record for the company.  We remain upbeat about the outlook for Ducommun's commercial business this year, given the platforms we serve, our customer relationships and the value provided through our technology and breadth of product offerings.  
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $884 million as of March 30, up slightly from the start of the year-end and as Steve mentioned, a new record for the company.  As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit.  Our gross margin was 20.7% in the first quarter versus 17.8% in the prior year's comparable period.  The increase of 290 basis points year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes and favorable product mix along with the many streamlining measures taken last year, as Steve discussed.  
SG&A was $22.8 million in the first quarter versus $19.3 million in 2018 with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $12.8 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue in the prior year period.  The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $2.2 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A.  On an adjusted basis, operating income was $7.4 million or 4.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.  
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $2.9 million last year, and this was due to the greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018 along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018.  The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by $8.9 million of higher gross profit.  Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $2.2 million, offset by a $3.5 million increase in SG&A, $1.5 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.3 million.  Adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was $21.7 million or 12.6% of revenue compared to $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 50%.
Now let me turn to the segment results.  Turning to Electronic Systems segment.  Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $82.4 million in the prior year period.  These results reflect an $8.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, $3.8 million of lower shipments within the commercial aerospace market reflecting order timing and $2.9 million of lower sales in the industrial end-use market as expected.  Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenue versus $5.7 million or 7% of revenue in the prior year period.  Excluding the restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 7.6% for the 2018 first quarter.  The year-over-year margin improvement was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.  
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $88.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $68 million last year.  This year-over-year increase was due to $15.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms and $4.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets.  
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue last year.  Excluding the restructuring charges, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 8.7% for the 2018 first quarter.  The year-over-year margin improvement reflects higher operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.
CG&A, corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $4.9 million or 3.2% of revenue last year.  The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $1.6 million.
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources.  We used $1.7 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2019 compared with generating $10.3 million of operating cash during the first quarter of 2018.  The change year-over-year was due to a decrease in accrued and other liabilities for incentive compensation payments that were substantially larger in the current quarter compared to 2018 Q1, and this was partially offset by higher net income.  We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019, and excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the first quarter and expect to spend approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support our new program wins.
We're very proud of the first quarter performance, which puts us on track for a very solid year ahead.  With that, I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Before we turn over the call for questions, just say a few words here.  
First, the quarter's performance really reflects a lot of the initiatives we implemented over the last 2 years, so I'm absolutely thrilled. I set out to streamline the organization, bringing new talent, focus the team on providing excellent customer service while vastly improving the bottom line results.
Given the current outlook for the diverse array of platforms we serve, both the defense and commercial aerospace sectors, we expect the company will continue expanding its market share, post solid margins and drive solid top line growth.  In addition, Ducommun will also work, as in the past, to enhance and optimize our product portfolio to provide innovative, value-added applications that ensure repeat business, attractive results and a solid return for our shareholders.  
So in closing, I think we're off to a great start in 2019.  And as always, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support.

267761,611032716,1729430,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 06, 2019",2019-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.",940,"Okay. Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
I'm very pleased to announce that we posted a strong start to fiscal 2019 with our overall performance surpassing expectations across the board. First quarter revenue grew roughly 15% year-over-year to $172.6 million driven by continued strong demand across a number of key commercial platforms, particularly the Boeing 737 where revenue grew sharply versus 2018.
737 is a very important program for us as well as our industry, and we are committed to serving Boeing as it deals with current serious situation. As reported, Boeing is actively engaged in fixing the issues and working with all involved including many regulators to get its plane back in the air as soon as possible. 
For Ducommun, let me remind everyone that roughly 40% of our content on the 737 platform goes through Spirit Aerosystems based in Wichita, Kansas, which is not cutting current production rates as previously announced. For Boeing direct, we are working closely with them and balancing support of their current rate requirements while also ensuring readiness, risk mitigation and alignment to the planned forward rates. In addition, our team is actively engaged with Boeing in adjusting current purchase orders as required. 
Due to our diverse customer base across Ducommun and the broader array of platforms served, we continue to anticipate 5% to 7% revenue growth across our commercial aerospace programs for the next 3 to 4 quarters. The longer-term outlook after that is dependent on the timing of the 737 MAX returning to service and Boeing's new production schedule.
We ended the quarter with another record backlog of $884 million and a book-to-bill of 111%, again, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships, the value we provide and the technology offerings. In addition, our work to improve profitability continued. Overall gross margins rose an impressive 290 basis points year-over-year to 20.7%. Our op margin reached 7.4% while we posted $21.7 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Results are particularly strong within our Structures segment where operating margins reached 11.9% due to the many actions taken in 2018 to streamline the business. The segment also benefited from higher overall production rates, additional content, lower scrap rates and the associated economies of scale.
In Q1, the company continued to build our innovation processes and a company culture, based on lean cultures. We've identified additional future operational improvements and ways to reduce working capital, particularly with regards to scrap and inventory. We are underway to significantly improve those areas. Assessing the business and optimizing all our resources is something done continuously at Ducommun, even as we invest in our technology, operations, and most importantly, our people, to become world-class at everything we do at the company.
Our 2 recent acquisitions are also adding value to the organization and helping our growth trajectory. We continue to look at additional opportunities that can leverage our applications and strengthen our proprietary technologies offerings to the industry. I think we have also demonstrated to investors in the marketplace a strong track record of integration and driving value once acquired. I look forward to more activity in the future. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $76.7 million, up 21% from last year, primarily reflecting stronger sales across a variety of missile applications. Aside from significant growth across such programs as the Patriot, we also noted positive trends with certain military helicopter platforms and the very important F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Other areas of our defense business were impacted by order timing and transfer of production to Huntsville from our Phoenix facility, but we anticipate higher shipments in the coming quarter. The overall market for our military applications looks bright, given our proposed budget that includes increased spending from various missile programs along with solid demand for the F-15, F-18 and F-35 as well as certain helicopter platforms. We ended the quarter with the military and space backlog of around $347 million, near record levels.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose approximately 16% year-over-year to $85.5 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft-s such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 family. We also saw some nice double-digit growth on the Boeing 787 platform driven by an increase in build rate from 12 to 14 aeroplanes per month. In total, our large fixed-wing business grew 25% year-over-year. In addition, we're experiencing an uptick in our regional business -- jet business driven by Gulfstream, another OEM, where we expect further room for content expansion.
I do want to provide an update on our VersaCore Composite technology as well. The team remains on track with our 10-year $200 million contract to supply missile components and are preparing our Guaymas, Mexico facility to begin full production in 2020. Wins such as this and contributions from our recent acquisitions strengthen the outlook for Ducommun while diversifying our base of business.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace grew to just under $500 million at the end of the quarter, representing another new record for the company. We remain upbeat about the outlook for Ducommun's commercial business this year, given the platforms we serve, our customer relationships and the value provided through our technology and breadth of product offerings. 
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,611032716,1729430,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 06, 2019",2019-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. Revenue for the firs",935,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $172.6 million versus $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. This performance includes $13.1 million of greater sales to the military and space sector primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $11.9 million of higher revenue with commercial aerospace customers, due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320. 
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $884 million as of March 30, up slightly from the start of the year-end and as Steve mentioned, a new record for the company. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 20.7% in the first quarter versus 17.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase of 290 basis points year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes and favorable product mix along with the many streamlining measures taken last year, as Steve discussed. 
SG&A was $22.8 million in the first quarter versus $19.3 million in 2018 with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $12.8 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $2.2 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $7.4 million or 4.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2018. 
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $2.9 million last year, and this was due to the greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018 along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by $8.9 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $2.2 million, offset by a $3.5 million increase in SG&A, $1.5 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.3 million. Adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was $21.7 million or 12.6% of revenue compared to $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 50%.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $82.4 million in the prior year period. These results reflect an $8.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, $3.8 million of lower shipments within the commercial aerospace market reflecting order timing and $2.9 million of lower sales in the industrial end-use market as expected. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenue versus $5.7 million or 7% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding the restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 7.6% for the 2018 first quarter. The year-over-year margin improvement was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $88.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $68 million last year. This year-over-year increase was due to $15.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms and $4.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 8.7% for the 2018 first quarter. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects higher operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.
CG&A, corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $4.9 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $1.6 million.
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources. We used $1.7 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2019 compared with generating $10.3 million of operating cash during the first quarter of 2018. The change year-over-year was due to a decrease in accrued and other liabilities for incentive compensation payments that were substantially larger in the current quarter compared to 2018 Q1, and this was partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019, and excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the first quarter and expect to spend approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support our new program wins.
We're very proud of the first quarter performance, which puts us on track for a very solid year ahead. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Before we turn over the call for questions, just say a few words here. 
First, the quarter's performance really reflects a lot of the initiatives we implemented over the last 2 years, so I'm absolutely thrilled. I set out to streamline the organization, bringing new talent, focus the team on providing excellent customer service while vastly improving the bottom line results.
Given the current outlook for the diverse array of platforms we serve, both the defense and commercial aerospace sectors, we expect the company will continue expanding its market share, post solid margins and drive solid top line growth. In addition, Ducommun will also work, as in the past, to enhance and optimize our product portfolio to provide innovative, value-added applications that ensure repeat business, attractive results and a solid return for our shareholders. 
So in closing, I think we're off to a great start in 2019. And as always, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support.

Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call.

Thanks, Chris and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2019 first quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company, after which Doug will review our financial results in detail. 
I'm very pleased to announce that we posted a strong start to fiscal 2019 with our overall performance surpassing expectations across the board. First quarter revenue grew roughly 15% year-over-year to $172.6 million driven by continued strong demand across a number of key commercial platforms, particularly the Boeing 737 where revenue grew sharply versus 2018.
737 is a very important program for us as well as our industry, and we are committed to serving Boeing as it deals with current serious situation. As reported, Boeing is actively engaged in fixing the issues and working with all involved including many regulators to get its plane back in the air as soon as possible. 
For Ducommun, let me remind everyone that roughly 40% of our content on the 737 platform goes through Spirit Aerosystems based in Wichita, Kansas, which is not cutting current production rates as previously announced. For Boeing direct, we are working closely with them and balancing support of their current rate requirements while also ensuring readiness, risk mitigation and alignment to the planned forward rates. In addition, our team is actively engaged with Boeing in adjusting current purchase orders as required. 
Due to our diverse customer base across Ducommun and the broader array of platforms served, we continue to anticipate 5% to 7% revenue growth across our commercial aerospace programs for the next 3 to 4 quarters. The longer-term outlook after that is dependent on the timing of the 737 MAX returning to service and Boeing's new production schedule.
We ended the quarter with another record backlog of $884 million and a book-to-bill of 111%, again, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships, the value we provide and the technology offerings. In addition, our work to improve profitability continued. Overall gross margins rose an impressive 290 basis points year-over-year to 20.7%. Our op margin reached 7.4% while we posted $21.7 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Results are particularly strong within our Structures segment where operating margins reached 11.9% due to the many actions taken in 2018 to streamline the business. The segment also benefited from higher overall production rates, additional content, lower scrap rates and the associated economies of scale.
In Q1, the company continued to build our innovation processes and a company culture, based on lean cultures. We've identified additional future operational improvements and ways to reduce working capital, particularly with regards to scrap and inventory. We are underway to significantly improve those areas. Assessing the business and optimizing all our resources is something done continuously at Ducommun, even as we invest in our technology, operations, and most importantly, our people, to become world-class at everything we do at the company.
Our 2 recent acquisitions are also adding value to the organization and helping our growth trajectory. We continue to look at additional opportunities that can leverage our applications and strengthen our proprietary technologies offerings to the industry. I think we have also demonstrated to investors in the marketplace a strong track record of integration and driving value once acquired. I look forward to more activity in the future. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $76.7 million, up 21% from last year, primarily reflecting stronger sales across a variety of missile applications. Aside from significant growth across such programs as the Patriot, we also noted positive trends with certain military helicopter platforms and the very important F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Other areas of our defense business were impacted by order timing and transfer of production to Huntsville from our Phoenix facility, but we anticipate higher shipments in the coming quarter. The overall market for our military applications looks bright, given our proposed budget that includes increased spending from various missile programs along with solid demand for the F-15, F-18 and F-35 as well as certain helicopter platforms. We ended the quarter with the military and space backlog of around $347 million, near record levels.
Within our commercial aerospace operations, first quarter sales rose approximately 16% year-over-year to $85.5 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft-s such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 family. We also saw some nice double-digit growth on the Boeing 787 platform driven by an increase in build rate from 12 to 14 aeroplanes per month. In total, our large fixed-wing business grew 25% year-over-year. In addition, we're experiencing an uptick in our regional business -- jet business driven by Gulfstream, another OEM, where we expect further room for content expansion.
I do want to provide an update on our VersaCore Composite technology as well. The team remains on track with our 10-year $200 million contract to supply missile components and are preparing our Guaymas, Mexico facility to begin full production in 2020. Wins such as this and contributions from our recent acquisitions strengthen the outlook for Ducommun while diversifying our base of business.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace grew to just under $500 million at the end of the quarter, representing another new record for the company. We remain upbeat about the outlook for Ducommun's commercial business this year, given the platforms we serve, our customer relationships and the value provided through our technology and breadth of product offerings. 
With that, I'll have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"
267761,611032716,1734066,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 06, 2019",2019-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. Revenue for the firs",935,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $172.6 million versus $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. This performance includes $13.1 million of greater sales to the military and space sector primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $11.9 million of higher revenue with commercial aerospace customers, due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320. 
Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $884 million as of March 30, up slightly from the start of the year-end and as Steve mentioned, a new record for the company. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 20.7% in the first quarter versus 17.8% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase of 290 basis points year-over-year was primarily due to higher production volumes and favorable product mix along with the many streamlining measures taken last year, as Steve discussed. 
SG&A was $22.8 million in the first quarter versus $19.3 million in 2018 with the increase primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the first quarter of $12.8 million or 7.4% of revenue compared to $5.3 million or 3.5% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $2.2 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $7.4 million or 4.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2018. 
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $2.9 million last year, and this was due to the greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018 along with higher interest rates.
The company reported net income for the first quarter of $7.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by $8.9 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $2.2 million, offset by a $3.5 million increase in SG&A, $1.5 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.3 million. Adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 was $21.7 million or 12.6% of revenue compared to $14.5 million or 9.6% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 50%.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Turning to Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $84.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $82.4 million in the prior year period. These results reflect an $8.5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, $3.8 million of lower shipments within the commercial aerospace market reflecting order timing and $2.9 million of lower sales in the industrial end-use market as expected. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $9.2 million or 10.9% of revenue versus $5.7 million or 7% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding the restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was 7.6% for the 2018 first quarter. The year-over-year margin improvement was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $88.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus $68 million last year. This year-over-year increase was due to $15.7 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms and $4.6 million of increased revenue within the company's military and space markets. 
Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $10.5 million or 11.9% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.5% of revenue last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, Structure's adjusted operating margin was 8.7% for the 2018 first quarter. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects higher operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies and product mix.
CG&A, corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $6.9 million or 4% of revenue versus $4.9 million or 3.2% of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $1.6 million.
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources. We used $1.7 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2019 compared with generating $10.3 million of operating cash during the first quarter of 2018. The change year-over-year was due to a decrease in accrued and other liabilities for incentive compensation payments that were substantially larger in the current quarter compared to 2018 Q1, and this was partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019, and excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using operating cash flow to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $3.2 million during the first quarter and expect to spend approximately $15 million to $17 million in 2019 to support our new program wins.
We're very proud of the first quarter performance, which puts us on track for a very solid year ahead. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Before we turn over the call for questions, just say a few words here. 
First, the quarter's performance really reflects a lot of the initiatives we implemented over the last 2 years, so I'm absolutely thrilled. I set out to streamline the organization, bringing new talent, focus the team on providing excellent customer service while vastly improving the bottom line results.
Given the current outlook for the diverse array of platforms we serve, both the defense and commercial aerospace sectors, we expect the company will continue expanding its market share, post solid margins and drive solid top line growth. In addition, Ducommun will also work, as in the past, to enhance and optimize our product portfolio to provide innovative, value-added applications that ensure repeat business, attractive results and a solid return for our shareholders. 
So in closing, I think we're off to a great start in 2019. And as always, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support.

Second quarter was another one of accomplishment for Ducommun
As we continue to benefit from strong business execution growth on key platforms, a diversified customer base and robust product demand. Revenue grew an impressive 16.6% year-over-year to $180.5 million, driven by higher shipments across a variety of large narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 family as well as JSF, Raytheon Missile platforms and the Apache helicopter program. 
Revenue related to the 737 MAX rose at a substantially higher rate year-over-year, reflecting the current build rates of 52 per month at Spirit Aerosystems and 42 per month at Boeing. While volume works to address the 737 MAX situation, we continue to communicate with them and are operationally ready to increase production if and when required. For Ducommun, with strong momentum in revenue and backlog across a variety of amounts of customers, we do not expect any material issues to our top line view of 7% to 9% growth across our commercial aerospace and military platforms for the rest of 2019. 
For the second quarter, operating income was substantially increased on an adjusted basis by 23.7% from the prior year. Gross margins also rose again this quarter to 21.1% compared to 20.7% last year, while Ducommun's operating margin was significantly higher by 390 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. We posted as well $22.4 million adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of nearly 20% over the comparable period in 2018. This performance is driven by our structures segment due to higher overall production rates, scale and the many actions we've taken in the past to streamline the business. 
The Electronics segment margins were equal to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $853 million, a decrease from the first quarter, primarily reflecting some order timing. Our backlog remains near-record levels for the company, underscoring our unique manufacturing services and technologies, engineered products and strong customer relations, both at the OEM and at the first tier level. 
The team at Ducommun was also delighted with the announcement last week of our newly signed strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems. Being the first supplier to be selected by RMS for this initiative is an honor and a great step forward for a stronger relationship and higher revenue opportunities for the company in the future. This partnership will allow us to collaborate and compete on every RMS platform, either new or existing, and that includes structural components, which will be a key growth area for the strategic customer in 2019 and subsequent years. 
We also very much appreciate the recognition of our Monrovia, California Performance Center being selected in July as the 2019 Raytheon
Supplier Excellence, Premier Award winner. This is our first major customer award for the company since 2017. 
We had very good activity, too, at the Paris Air Show, and for both interest and enthusiasm for our products and services across the board. The show is always great to be with customers, discuss future growth initiatives and highlight our technology and value. During the show, we announced that the company was on track with its $200 million contract to supply Middle River AeroStructures Systems with LEAP engine nacelle components for the Airbus A320 platform, using our proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology. This is a great development, and Ducommun team is working hard at our Guaymas, Mexico facility to deliver on this important opportunity. 
Now let me provide some additional color on end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $77.2 million, up nearly 10% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. We saw substantial growth in electronics for the Patriot missile; the Joint Standoff Weapon, or JSF; the Chinook, Joint Strike Fighter; and F-15, along with various other applications for Raytheon and L3. Given the recently passed federal budget outline for fiscal 2020, the market for military spending remains very strong. And Ducommun plays a key role on many of the most important defense programs. 
We ended the quarter with military and space backlog of approximately $366 million, which is close to record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose nearly 30% year-over-year to $92 million. The growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family and new Gulfstream models. Our A320 business grew substantially year-over-year, and mostly all our Boeing platforms, including not only the 37, but 787, 777 and 767, all rose double-digit as well. 
We also posted significantly higher sales to Gulfstream this quarter as the OEM ramps up production on these new models. 
In summary, our large fixed-wing business is seeing excellent growth, clearly highlighting the key platforms we serve, the value we provide, the overall market conditions and continued operational improvement at the company. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $433 million at the end of the quarter, again, near record levels. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for this part of our business as well as the military market. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. Revenue for the seco",950,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $180.5 million versus $154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. This performance includes $20.1 million of higher revenue with our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrowbody platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned, and $6.9 million of greater sales in the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various military programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $853 million as of June 29, down from last quarter's record amount. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.1% in the second quarter versus 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix, along with many streamlining measures taken last year, as previously discussed. 
SG&A was $24.5 million in the second quarter versus $21.2 million in 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting onetime severance charges and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $5.4 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expense. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, operating income was $11.0 million or 7.1% of sales. The increase in the second quarter of 2019 operating income versus 2018 adjusted operating income was $2.6 million, which is an increase of 23.7%. Interest expense was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million last year due to greater utilization of our credit facility for the certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018, along with higher interest rates. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $7.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6 million of higher gross profit. 
Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $5.4 million, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher SG&A, $0.7 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.1 million. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, net income was $6.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The increase in the second quarter 2019 net income versus 2018 adjusted net income was $1.5 million, which is an increase of 23.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was $22.4 million or 12.4% of revenue compared to $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of nearly 20%. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $84.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5.9 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, slightly offset by lower revenue within our industrial end-use markets. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $9.9 million or 11.1% of revenue versus $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges last year, Electronics adjusted operating margin was also 11.1% for the 2018 second quarter. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $70.3 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $20 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and a slight increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.8 million or 12.9% of revenue compared to $5 million or 7.1% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structural's adjusted operating margin was 12.7% for the 2018 second quarter. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expense for the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018 was roughly $8.1 million or 4.5% and 5.2% of revenue, respectively, for each year. The year-over-year results reflect the absence of $1.1 million in restructuring charges that were incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the lower professional services fees of $1 million in 2019, partially offset by onetime severance charges of $1.7 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $9.8 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $15.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in working capital investment to support growth, partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019 and, excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using cash to further reduce the company's leverage this year. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $5.9 million during the second quarter and expect to spend approximately $16 million to $18 million during 2019 in total to support new program wins. We're once again proud of at our quarterly performance, which puts us on track for solid results in the second half. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Ducommun's innovative technology and the value we provide, along with our strong relationships, as I mentioned earlier, with Boeing, Raytheon, Airbus, Gulfstream and many others in aerospace and defense, I think, position us well now and in the years ahead. Before we go to questions, I do want to also mention that August is the month we recognize the founding of Ducommun, and we are very happy to be celebrating the 170th  year of the company, which started in 1849 in California. Ducommun is proud to be recognized as the oldest company in the state. We look forward to many great years and decades ahead.

As far as the platform, the nice thing about us, I mean, just talking about structures in general, if we're getting fairly -- we're getting more diversified as we go, okay. So we might see some flattening if the Max takes a little more time, and we might have a little bit of a lift there. But we -- we're -- we've got a really good growing business at Airbus.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company. After which, Chris Wampler, our Interim CFO, will review our financial results in detail. Second quarter was another one of accomplishment for Ducommun as we continue to benefit from strong business execution, growth on key platforms, a diversified customer base and robust product demand. Revenue grew an impressive 16.6% year-over-year to $180.5 million, driven by higher shipments across a variety of large narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 family as well as JSF, Raytheon Missile platforms and the Apache helicopter program. 
Revenue related to the 737 MAX rose at a substantially higher rate year-over-year, reflecting the current build rates of 52 per month at Spirit Aerosystems and 42 per month at Boeing. While Boeing works to address the 737 MAX situation, we continue to communicate with them and are operationally ready to increase production if and when required. For Ducommun, with strong momentum in revenue and backlog across a variety of amount of customers, we do not expect any material issues to our top line view of 7% to 9% growth across our commercial aerospace and military platforms for the rest of 2019. 
For the second quarter, operating income was substantially increased on an adjusted basis by 23.7% from the prior year. Gross margins also rose again this quarter to 21.1% compared to 20.7% last year, while Ducommun's operating margin was significantly higher by 390 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. We posted as well $22.4 million adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of nearly 20% over the comparable period in 2018. This performance is driven by our structures segment due to higher overall production rates, scale and the many actions we've taken in the past to streamline the business. 
The Electronic segment's segment margins were equal to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $853 million, a decrease from the first quarter, primarily reflecting some order timing. Our backlog remains near-record levels for the company, underscoring our unique manufacturing services and technologies, engineered products and strong customer relations, both at the OEM and at the first tier level. 
The team at Ducommun was also delighted with the announcement last week of our newly signed strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems. Being the first supplier to be selected by RMS for this initiative is an honor and a great step forward for a stronger relationship and higher revenue opportunities for the company in the future. This partnership will allow us to collaborate and compete on every RMS platform, either new or existing, and that includes structural components, which will be a key growth area for the strategic customer in 2019 and subsequent years. 
We also very much appreciate the recognition of our Monrovia, California Performance Center being selected in July as the 2019 Raytheon
Supplier Excellence Premier Award winner. This is our first major customer award for the company since 2017. 
We had very good activity too, at the Paris Air Show, and saw both interest and enthusiasm for our products and services across the board. The show is always great to be with customers, discuss future growth initiatives and highlight our technology and value. During the show, we announced that the company was on track with its $200 million contract to supply Middle River Aerostructure Systems with LEAP engine nacelle components for the Airbus A320 platform, using our proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology. This is a great development, and the Ducommun team is working hard at our Guaymas, Mexico facility to deliver on this important opportunity. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $77.2 million, up nearly 10% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. We saw a substantial growth in electronics for the Patriot missile; the Joint Standoff Weapon, or JSOW; the Chinook; Joint Strike Fighter; and F-15, along with various other applications for Raytheon and L3. Given the recently passed federal budget outline for fiscal 2020, the market for military spending remains very strong. And Ducommun plays a key role on many of the most important defense programs. 
We ended the quarter with military and space backlog of approximately $366 million, which is close to record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose nearly 30% year-over-year to $92 million. The growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family and new Gulfstream models. Our A320 business grew substantially year-over-year, and mostly all our Boeing platforms, including not only the 37, but 787, 777 and 767, all rose double-digit as well. 
We also posted significantly higher sales to Gulfstream this quarter as the OEM ramps up production on these new models. 
In summary, our large fixed-wing business is seeing excellent growth, clearly highlighting the key platforms that we serve, the value we provide, the overall market conditions and continued operational improvement at the company. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $433 million at the end of the quarter, again, near record levels. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for this part of our business as well as the military market. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for a further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $180.5 million versus $154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. This performance includes $20.1 million of higher revenue with our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrowbody platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned, and $6.9 million of greater sales in the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various military programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $853 million as of June 29, down from last quarter's record amount. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.1% in the second quarter versus 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix, along with many streamlining measures taken last year, as previously discussed. 
SG&A was $24.5 million in the second quarter versus $21.2 million in 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting onetime severance charges and higher compensation of benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $5.4 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expense. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, operating income was $11.0 million or 7.1% of sales. The increase in the second quarter of 2019 operating income versus 2018 adjusted operating income was $2.6 million, which is an increase of 23.7%. Interest expense was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million last year due to greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018, along with higher interest rates. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $7.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6 million of higher gross profit. 
Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $5.4 million, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher SG&A, $0.7 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.1 million. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, net income was $6.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The increase in the second quarter 2019 net income versus 2018 adjusted net income was $1.5 million, which is an increase of 23.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was $22.4 million or 12.4% of revenue compared to $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of nearly 20%. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $84.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5.9 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, slightly offset by lower revenue within our industrial end-use markets. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $9.9 million or 11.1% of revenue versus $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was also 11.1% for the 2018 second quarter. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $70.3 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $20 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and a slight increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.8 million or 12.9% of revenue compared to $5 million or 7.1% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structural's adjusted operating margin was 12.7% for the 2018 second quarter. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expense for the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018 was roughly $8.1 million or 4.5% and 5.2% of revenue, respectively, for each year. The year-over-year results reflect the absence of $1.1 million in restructuring charges that were incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the lower professional services fees of $1 million in 2019, partially offset by onetime severance charges of $1.7 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $9.8 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $15.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in working capital investment to support growth, partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019 and, excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using cash to further reduce the company's leverage this year. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $5.9 million during the second quarter and expect to spend approximately $16 million to $18 million during 2019 in total to support new program wins. We're once again proud of our quarterly performance, which puts us on track for solid results in the second half.

So can you talk about maybe what's left in the tank, and what levers you can pull without kind of thinking about acquisitions and what that might bring to the business overall?"

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company. After which, Chris Wampler, our Interim CFO, will review our financial results in detail. Second quarter was another one of accomplishment for Ducommun as we continue to benefit from strong business execution, growth on key platforms, a diversified customer base and robust product demand. Revenue grew an impressive 16.6% year-over-year to $180.5 million, driven by higher shipments across a variety of large narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 family as well as JSF, Raytheon Missile platforms and the Apache helicopter program. 
Revenue related to the 737 MAX rose at a substantially higher rate year-over-year, reflecting the current build rates of 52 per month at Spirit Aerosystems and 42 per month at Boeing. While Boeing works to address the 737 MAX situation, we continue to communicate with them and are operationally ready to increase production if and when required. For Ducommun, with strong momentum in revenue and backlog across a variety of amount of customers, we do not expect any material issues to our top line view of 7% to 9% growth across our commercial aerospace and military platforms for the rest of 2019. 
For the second quarter, operating income was substantially increased on an adjusted basis by 23.7% from the prior year. Gross margins also rose again this quarter to 21.1% compared to 20.7% last year, while Ducommun's operating margin was significantly higher by 390 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. We posted as well $22.4 million adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of nearly 20% over the comparable period in 2018. This performance is driven by our structures segment due to higher overall production rates, scale and the many actions we've taken in the past to streamline the business. 
The Electronic segment's segment margins were equal to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $853 million, a decrease from the first quarter, primarily reflecting some order timing. Our backlog remains near-record levels for the company, underscoring our unique manufacturing services and technologies, engineered products and strong customer relations, both at the OEM and at the first-tier level. 
The team at Ducommun was also delighted with the announcement last week of our newly signed strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems. Being the first supplier to be selected by RMS for this initiative is an honor and a great step forward for a stronger relationship and higher revenue opportunities for the company in the future. This partnership will allow us to collaborate and compete on every RMS platform, either new or existing, and that includes structural components, which will be a key growth area for the strategic customer in 2019 and subsequent years. 
We also very much appreciate the recognition of our Monrovia, California Performance Center being selected in July as the 2019 Raytheon
Supplier Excellence Premier Award winner. This is our first major customer award for the company since 2017. 
We had very good activity too, at the Paris Air Show, and saw both interest and enthusiasm for our products and services across the board. The show is always great to be with customers, discuss future growth initiatives and highlight our technology and value. During the show, we announced that the company was on track with its $200 million contract to supply Middle River Aerostructure Systems with LEAP engine nacelle components for the Airbus A320 platform, using our proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology. This is a great development, and the Ducommun team is working hard at our Guaymas, Mexico facility to deliver on this important opportunity. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $77.2 million, up nearly 10% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. We saw a substantial growth in electronics for the Patriot missile; the Joint Standoff Weapon, or JSOW; the Chinook; Joint Strike Fighter; and F-15, along with various other applications for Raytheon and L3. Given the recently passed federal budget outline for fiscal 2020, the market for military spending remains very strong. And Ducommun plays a key role on many of the most important defense programs. 
We ended the quarter with military and space backlog of approximately $366 million, which is close to record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose nearly 30% year-over-year to $92 million. The growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family and new Gulfstream models. Our A320 business grew substantially year-over-year, and mostly all our Boeing platforms, including not only the 37, but 787, 777 and 767, all rose double digit as well. 
We also posted significantly higher sales to Gulfstream this quarter as the OEM ramps up production on these new models. 
In summary, our large fixed-wing business is seeing excellent growth, clearly highlighting the key platforms that we serve, the value we provide, the overall market conditions and continued operational improvement at the company. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $433 million at the end of the quarter, again, near record levels. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for this part of our business as well as the military market. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for a further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results. 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $180.5 million versus $154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. This performance includes $20.1 million of higher revenue with our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrowbody platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned, and $6.9 million of greater sales in the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various military programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $853 million as of June 29, down from last quarter's record amount. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.1% in the second quarter versus 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix, along with many streamlining measures taken last year, as previously discussed. 
SG&A was $24.5 million in the second quarter versus $21.2 million in 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting onetime severance charges and higher compensation of benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $5.4 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expense. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, operating income was $11.0 million or 7.1% of sales. The increase in the second quarter of 2019 operating income versus 2018 adjusted operating income was $2.6 million, which is an increase of 23.7%. Interest expense was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million last year due to greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018, along with higher interest rates. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $7.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6 million of higher gross profit. 
Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $5.4 million, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher SG&A, $0.7 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.1 million. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, net income was $6.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The increase in the second quarter 2019 net income versus 2018 adjusted net income was $1.5 million, which is an increase of 23.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was $22.4 million or 12.4% of revenue compared to $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of nearly 20%. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic segment -- Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $84.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5.9 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, slightly offset by lower revenue within our industrial end-use markets. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $9.9 million or 11.1% of revenue versus $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was also 11.1% for the 2018 second quarter. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $70.3 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $20 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and a slight increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.8 million or 12.9% of revenue compared to $5 million or 7.1% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structural's adjusted operating margin was 12.7% for the 2018 second quarter. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expense for the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018 was roughly $8.1 million or 4.5% and 5.2% of revenue, respectively, for each year. The year-over-year results reflect the absence of $1.1 million in restructuring charges that were incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the lower professional services fees of $1 million in 2019, partially offset by onetime severance charges of $1.7 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $9.8 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $15.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in working capital investment to support growth, partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019 and, excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using cash to further reduce the company's leverage this year. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $5.9 million during the second quarter and expect to spend approximately $16 million to $18 million during 2019 in total to support new program wins. We're once again proud of our quarterly performance, which puts us on track for solid results in the second half. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Ducommun's innovative technology and the value we provide, along with our strong relationships, as I mentioned earlier with Boeing, Raytheon, Airbus, Gulfstream and many others in aerospace and defense, I think has positioned us well now and in the years ahead. Before we go to questions, I do want to also mention that August is the month we recognize the founding of Ducommun, and we are very happy to be celebrating the 170th year of the company, which started in 1849 in California.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company. After which, Chris Wampler, our Interim CFO, will review our financial results in detail. Second quarter was another one of accomplishment for Ducommun as we continue to benefit from strong business execution, growth on key platforms, a diversified customer base and robust product demand. Revenue grew an impressive 16.6% year-over-year to $180.5 million, driven by higher shipments across a variety of large narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 family as well as JSF, Raytheon Missile platforms and the Apache helicopter program.
 
Revenue related to the 737 MAX rose at a substantially higher rate year-over-year, reflecting the current build rates of 52 per month at Spirit Aerosystems and 42 per month at Boeing. While Boeing works to address the 737 MAX situation, we continue to communicate with them and are operationally ready to increase production if and when required. For Ducommun, with strong momentum in revenue and backlog across a variety of amount of customers, we do not expect any material issues to our top line view of 7% to 9% growth across our commercial aerospace and military platforms for the rest of 2019.
 
For the second quarter, operating income was substantially increased on an adjusted basis by 23.7% from the prior year. Gross margins also rose again this quarter to 21.1% compared to 20.7% last year, while Ducommun's operating margin was significantly higher by 390 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. We posted as well $22.4 million adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of nearly 20% over the comparable period in 2018. This performance is driven by our structures segment due to higher overall production rates, scale and the many actions we've taken in the past to streamline the business.
 
The Electronic segment's segment margins were equal to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $853 million, a decrease from the first quarter, primarily reflecting some order timing. Our backlog remains near-record levels for the company, underscoring our unique manufacturing services and technologies, engineered products and strong customer relations, both at the OEM and at the first-tier level.
 
The team at Ducommun was also delighted with the announcement last week of our newly signed strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems. Being the first supplier to be selected by RMS for this initiative is an honor and a great step forward for a stronger relationship and higher revenue opportunities for the company in the future. This partnership will allow us to collaborate and compete on every RMS platform, either new or existing, and that includes structural components, which will be a key growth area for the strategic customer in 2019 and subsequent years.
 
We also very much appreciate the recognition of our Monrovia, California Performance Center being selected in July as the 2019 Raytheon
Supplier Excellence Premier Award winner. This is our first major customer award for the company since 2017.
 
We had very good activity too, at the Paris Air Show, and saw both interest and enthusiasm for our products and services across the board. The show is always great to be with customers, discuss future growth initiatives and highlight our technology and value. During the show, we announced that the company was on track with its $200 million contract to supply Middle River Aerostructure Systems with LEAP engine nacelle components for the Airbus A320 platform, using our proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology. This is a great development, and the Ducommun team is working hard at our Guaymas, Mexico facility to deliver on this important opportunity.
 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $77.2 million, up nearly 10% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. We saw a substantial growth in electronics for the Patriot missile; the Joint Standoff Weapon, or JSOW; the Chinook; Joint Strike Fighter; and F-15, along with various other applications for Raytheon and L3. Given the recently passed federal budget outline for fiscal 2020, the market for military spending remains very strong. And Ducommun plays a key role on many of the most important defense programs.
 
We ended the quarter with military and space backlog of approximately $366 million, which is close to record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose nearly 30% year-over-year to $92 million. The growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family and new Gulfstream models. Our A320 business grew substantially year-over-year, and mostly all our Boeing platforms, including not only the 37, but 787, 777 and 767, all rose double digit as well.
 
We also posted significantly higher sales to Gulfstream this quarter as the OEM ramps up production on these new models.
 
In summary, our large fixed-wing business is seeing excellent growth, clearly highlighting the key platforms that we serve, the value we provide, the overall market conditions and continued operational improvement at the company. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $433 million at the end of the quarter, again, near record levels. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for this part of our business as well as the military market.

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for a further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results.
 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $180.5 million versus $154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. This performance includes $20.1 million of higher revenue with our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrowbody platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned, and $6.9 million of greater sales in the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various military programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $853 million as of June 29, down from last quarter's record amount. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.1% in the second quarter versus 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix, along with many streamlining measures taken last year, as previously discussed.
 
SG&A was $24.5 million in the second quarter versus $21.2 million in 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting onetime severance charges and higher compensation of benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $5.4 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expense. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, operating income was $11.0 million or 7.1% of sales. The increase in the second quarter of 2019 operating income versus 2018 adjusted operating income was $2.6 million, which is an increase of 23.7%. Interest expense was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million last year due to greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018, along with higher interest rates. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $7.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6 million of higher gross profit.
 
Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $5.4 million, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher SG&A, $0.7 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.1 million. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, net income was $6.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The increase in the second quarter 2019 net income versus 2018 adjusted net income was $1.5 million, which is an increase of 23.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was $22.4 million or 12.4% of revenue compared to $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of nearly 20%.
 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic segment -- Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $84.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5.9 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, slightly offset by lower revenue within our industrial end-use markets. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $9.9 million or 11.1% of revenue versus $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was also 11.1% for the 2018 second quarter.
 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $70.3 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $20 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and a slight increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.8 million or 12.9% of revenue compared to $5 million or 7.1% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structural's adjusted operating margin was 12.7% for the 2018 second quarter.
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expense for the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018 was roughly $8.1 million or 4.5% and 5.2% of revenue, respectively, for each year. The year-over-year results reflect the absence of $1.1 million in restructuring charges that were incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the lower professional services fees of $1 million in 2019, partially offset by onetime severance charges of $1.7 million.
 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $9.8 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $15.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in working capital investment to support growth, partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019 and, excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using cash to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $5.9 million during the second quarter and expect to spend approximately $16 million to $18 million during 2019 in total to support new program wins. We're once again proud of our quarterly performance, which puts us on track for solid results in the second half.

So we might see some flattening if the MAX takes a little more time, and we might have a little bit of a lift there. But we -- we're -- we've got a really good growing business at Airbus. We have the Gulfstream business, we -- down the road, we're going to hopefully pick up some structures business at Raytheon. So I think we've got a lot of diversification that I think is going to help."

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company. After which, Chris Wampler, our Interim CFO, will review our financial results in detail. Second quarter was another one of accomplishment for Ducommun as we continue to benefit from strong business execution, growth on key platforms, a diversified customer base and robust product demand. Revenue grew an impressive 16.6% year-over-year to $180.5 million, driven by higher shipments across a variety of large narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 family as well as JSF, Raytheon Missile platforms and the Apache helicopter program.
 
Revenue related to the 737 MAX rose at a substantially higher rate year-over-year, reflecting the current build rates of 52 per month at Spirit Aerosystems and 42 per month at Boeing. While Boeing works to address the 737 MAX situation, we continue to communicate with them and are operationally ready to increase production if and when required. For Ducommun, with strong momentum in revenue and backlog across a variety of amount of customers, we do not expect any material issues to our top line view of 7% to 9% growth across our commercial aerospace and military platforms for the rest of 2019.
 
For the second quarter, operating income was substantially increased on an adjusted basis by 23.7% from the prior year. Gross margins also rose again this quarter to 21.1% compared to 20.7% last year, while Ducommun's operating margin was significantly higher by 390 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. We posted as well $22.4 million adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of nearly 20% over the comparable period in 2018. This performance is driven by our structures segment due to higher overall production rates, scale and the many actions we've taken in the past to streamline the business.
 
The Electronic segment's segment margins were equal to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $853 million, a decrease from the first quarter, primarily reflecting some order timing. Our backlog remains near-record levels for the company, underscoring our unique manufacturing services and technologies, engineered products and strong customer relations, both at the OEM and at the first-tier level.
 
The team at Ducommun was also delighted with the announcement last week of our newly signed strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems. Being the first supplier to be selected by RMS for this initiative is an honor and a great step forward for a stronger relationship and higher revenue opportunities for the company in the future. This partnership will allow us to collaborate and compete on every RMS platform, either new or existing, and that includes structural components, which will be a key growth area for the strategic customer in 2019 and subsequent years.
 
We also very much appreciate the recognition of our Monrovia, California Performance Center being selected in July as the 2019 Raytheon
Supplier Excellence Premier Award winner. This is our first major customer award for the company since 2017.
 
We had very good activity too, at the Paris Air Show, and saw both interest and enthusiasm for our products and services across the board. The show is always great to be with customers, discuss future growth initiatives and highlight our technology and value. During the show, we announced that the company was on track with its $200 million contract to supply Middle River Aerostructure Systems with LEAP engine nacelle components for the Airbus A320 platform, using our proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology. This is a great development, and the Ducommun team is working hard at our Guaymas, Mexico facility to deliver on this important opportunity.
 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $77.2 million, up nearly 10% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. We saw a substantial growth in electronics for the Patriot missile; the Joint Standoff Weapon, or JSOW; the Chinook; Joint Strike Fighter; and F-15, along with various other applications for Raytheon and L3. Given the recently passed federal budget outline for fiscal 2020, the market for military spending remains very strong. And Ducommun plays a key role on many of the most important defense programs.
 
We ended the quarter with military and space backlog of approximately $366 million, which is close to record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose nearly 30% year-over-year to $92 million. The growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family and new Gulfstream models. Our A320 business grew substantially year-over-year, and mostly all our Boeing platforms, including not only the 37, but 787, 777 and 767, all rose double digit as well.
 
We also posted significantly higher sales to Gulfstream this quarter as the OEM ramps up production on these new models.
 
In summary, our large fixed-wing business is seeing excellent growth, clearly highlighting the key platforms that we serve, the value we provide, the overall market conditions and continued operational improvement at the company. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $433 million at the end of the quarter, again, near record levels. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for this part of our business as well as the military market.
 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for a further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results.
 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $180.5 million versus $154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. This performance includes $20.1 million of higher revenue with our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrowbody platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned, and $6.9 million of greater sales in the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various military programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $853 million as of June 29, down from last quarter's record amount. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.1% in the second quarter versus 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix, along with many streamlining measures taken last year, as previously discussed.
 
SG&A was $24.5 million in the second quarter versus $21.2 million in 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting onetime severance charges and higher compensation of benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $5.4 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expense. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, operating income was $11.0 million or 7.1% of sales. The increase in the second quarter of 2019 operating income versus 2018 adjusted operating income was $2.6 million, which is an increase of 23.7%. Interest expense was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million last year due to greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018, along with higher interest rates. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $7.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6 million of higher gross profit.
 
Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $5.4 million, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher SG&A, $0.7 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.1 million. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, net income was $6.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The increase in the second quarter 2019 net income versus 2018 adjusted net income was $1.5 million, which is an increase of 23.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was $22.4 million or 12.4% of revenue compared to $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of nearly 20%.
 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic segment -- Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $84.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5.9 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, slightly offset by lower revenue within our industrial end-use markets. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $9.9 million or 11.1% of revenue versus $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was also 11.1% for the 2018 second quarter.
 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $70.3 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $20 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and a slight increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.8 million or 12.9% of revenue compared to $5 million or 7.1% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structural's adjusted operating margin was 12.7% for the 2018 second quarter.
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expense for the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018 was roughly $8.1 million or 4.5% and 5.2% of revenue, respectively, for each year. The year-over-year results reflect the absence of $1.1 million in restructuring charges that were incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the lower professional services fees of $1 million in 2019, partially offset by onetime severance charges of $1.7 million.
 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $9.8 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $15.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in working capital investment to support growth, partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019 and, excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using cash to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $5.9 million during the second quarter and expect to spend approximately $16 million to $18 million during 2019 in total to support new program wins. We're once again proud of our quarterly performance, which puts us on track for solid results in the second half.
 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Ducommun's innovative technology and the value we provide, along with our strong relationships, as I mentioned earlier with Boeing, Raytheon, Airbus, Gulfstream and many others in aerospace and defense, I think has positioned us well now and in the years ahead. Before we go to questions, I do want to also mention that August is the month we recognize the founding of Ducommun, and we are very happy to be celebrating the 170th year of the company, which started in 1849 in California.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments of the company. After which, Chris Wampler, our Interim CFO, will review our financial results in detail. Second quarter was another one of accomplishment for Ducommun as we continue to benefit from strong business execution, growth on key platforms, a diversified customer base and robust product demand. Revenue grew an impressive 16.6% year-over-year to $180.5 million, driven by higher shipments across a variety of large narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 family as well as JSF, Raytheon Missile platforms and the Apache helicopter program.
 
Revenue related to the 737 MAX rose at a substantially higher rate year-over-year, reflecting the current build rates of 52 per month at Spirit Aerosystems and 42 per month at Boeing. While Boeing works to address the 737 MAX situation, we continue to communicate with them and are operationally ready to increase production if and when required. For Ducommun, with strong momentum in revenue and backlog across a variety of amount of customers, we do not expect any material issues to our top line view of 7% to 9% growth across our commercial aerospace and military platforms for the rest of 2019.
 
For the second quarter, operating income was substantially increased on an adjusted basis by 23.7% from the prior year. Gross margins also rose again this quarter to 21.1% compared to 20.7% last year, while Ducommun's operating margin was significantly higher by 390 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. We posted as well $22.4 million adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of nearly 20% over the comparable period in 2018. This performance is driven by our structures segment due to higher overall production rates, scale and the many actions we've taken in the past to streamline the business.
 
The Electronic segment's segment margins were equal to the prior year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $853 million, a decrease from the first quarter, primarily reflecting some order timing. Our backlog remains near-record levels for the company, underscoring our unique manufacturing services and technologies, engineered products and strong customer relations, both at the OEM and at the first-tier level.
 
The team at Ducommun was also delighted with the announcement last week of our newly signed strategic supplier agreement with Raytheon Missile Systems. Being the first supplier to be selected by RMS for this initiative is an honor and a great step forward for a stronger relationship and higher revenue opportunities for the company in the future. This partnership will allow us to collaborate and compete on every RMS platform, either new or existing, and that includes structural components, which will be a key growth area for the strategic customer in 2019 and subsequent years.
 
We also very much appreciate the recognition of our Monrovia, California Performance Center being selected in July as the 2019 Raytheon
Supplier Excellence Premier Award winner. This is our first major customer award for the company since 2017.
 
We had very good activity too, at the Paris Air Show, and saw both interest and enthusiasm for our products and services across the board. The show is always great to be with customers, discuss future growth initiatives and highlight our technology and value. During the show, we announced that the company was on track with its $200 million contract to supply Middle River Aerostructure Systems with LEAP engine nacelle components for the Airbus A320 platform, using our proprietary VersaCore Composite process technology. This is a great development, and the Ducommun team is working hard at our Guaymas, Mexico facility to deliver on this important opportunity.
 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted second quarter revenue of $77.2 million, up nearly 10% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. We saw a substantial growth in electronics for the Patriot missile; the Joint Standoff Weapon, or JSOW; the Chinook; Joint Strike Fighter; and F-15, along with various other applications for Raytheon and L3. Given the recently passed federal budget outline for fiscal 2020, the market for military spending remains very strong. And Ducommun plays a key role on many of the most important defense programs.
 
We ended the quarter with military and space backlog of approximately $366 million, which is close to record levels. Within our commercial aerospace operations, second quarter sales rose nearly 30% year-over-year to $92 million. The growth was primarily fueled by large fixed-wing narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family and new Gulfstream models. Our A320 business grew substantially year-over-year, and mostly all our Boeing platforms, including not only the 37, but 787, 777 and 767, all rose double digit as well.
 
We also posted significantly higher sales to Gulfstream this quarter as the OEM ramps up production on these new models.
 
In summary, our large fixed-wing business is seeing excellent growth, clearly highlighting the key platforms that we serve, the value we provide, the overall market conditions and continued operational improvement at the company. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $433 million at the end of the quarter, again, near record levels. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for this part of our business as well as the military market.

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for a further description of matters under discussion during the call. I'll begin with details of our overall results.
 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $180.5 million versus $154.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. This performance includes $20.1 million of higher revenue with our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrowbody platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned, and $6.9 million of greater sales in the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various military programs. Ducommun's overall backlog was approximately $853 million as of June 29, down from last quarter's record amount. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.1% in the second quarter versus 20.7% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to favorable manufacturing volumes and favorable product mix, along with many streamlining measures taken last year, as previously discussed.
 
SG&A was $24.5 million in the second quarter versus $21.2 million in 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting onetime severance charges and higher compensation of benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the second quarter of $13.6 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue and gross profit as well as the impact of $5.4 million in lower restructuring charges partially offset by higher SG&A expense. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, operating income was $11.0 million or 7.1% of sales. The increase in the second quarter of 2019 operating income versus 2018 adjusted operating income was $2.6 million, which is an increase of 23.7%. Interest expense was $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $3.8 million last year due to greater utilization of our credit facility for the Certified Thermoplastics acquisition in April 2018, along with higher interest rates. The company reported net income for the second quarter of $7.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6 million of higher gross profit.
 
Restructuring charges were also lower year-over-year by $5.4 million, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher SG&A, $0.7 million of increased interest expense and greater income taxes of $1.1 million. On an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2018, net income was $6.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The increase in the second quarter 2019 net income versus 2018 adjusted net income was $1.5 million, which is an increase of 23.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 was $22.4 million or 12.4% of revenue compared to $18.7 million or 12.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of nearly 20%.
 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic segment -- Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $89.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $84.5 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5.9 million increase in sales to our military and space customers, slightly offset by lower revenue within our industrial end-use markets. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $9.9 million or 11.1% of revenue versus $8.7 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges last year, Electronic's adjusted operating margin was also 11.1% for the 2018 second quarter.
 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus $70.3 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $20 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, particularly large airframe single-aisle platforms, and a slight increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $11.8 million or 12.9% of revenue compared to $5 million or 7.1% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structural's adjusted operating margin was 12.7% for the 2018 second quarter.
 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expense for the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018 was roughly $8.1 million or 4.5% and 5.2% of revenue, respectively, for each year. The year-over-year results reflect the absence of $1.1 million in restructuring charges that were incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the lower professional services fees of $1 million in 2019, partially offset by onetime severance charges of $1.7 million.
 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $9.8 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $15.9 million during the second quarter of 2018. The decline year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in working capital investment to support growth, partially offset by higher net income. We expect more typical cash flow patterns for the remainder of 2019 and, excluding any unforeseen acquisitions, anticipate using cash to further reduce the company's leverage this year.
 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $5.9 million during the second quarter and expect to spend approximately $16 million to $18 million during 2019 in total to support new program wins. We're once again proud of our quarterly performance, which puts us on track for solid results in the second half.

Before we go to questions, I do want to also mention that August is the month we recognize the founding of Ducommun, and we are very happy to be celebrating the 170th year of the company, which started in 1849 in California. Ducommun is proud to be recognized as the oldest company in the state. We look forward to many great years and decades ahead.
 
So with that, operator, we'll now open up the call for questions. Thank you."

And as I look through the platform, you talked about your key customer there. There seem to be some rationalization of costs on their 2Q call that they talked about. What are your contingency plans in the event that production continues to weigh in here or, at the worst-case scenario, does stop briefly? And then ultimately, when you look at the platform, longer term, how do you think about the growth rate there? I imagine it eventually gets flattened out for a while before it reaccelerates?"

We certainly are ready to -- we're very close to Boeing. And as I mentioned earlier, we're very close to the situation. And we're certainly hopeful, but we'll be ready if we have to make some changes, the one way or the other. As far as the platform, the nice thing about us that, I mean, just talking about structures in general, is if we're getting fairly more -- we're getting more diversified as we go, okay. So we might see some flattening if the MAX takes a little more time, and we might have a little bit of a lift there. But we -- we're -- we've got a really good growing business at Airbus. We have the Gulfstream business, we -- down the road, we're going to hopefully pick up some structures business at Raytheon.

As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company. After which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As mentioned in the press release this afternoon, I'm very happy with our third quarter results and continued strong performance of the company, now having as well 5 straight quarters of double-digit revenue increases, averaging 15%, with over 85% of the gains organic. 
Ducommun's revenue for the third quarter also grew at 13% year-over-year to $181 million, driven by increased shipments on large narrow-body aircraft platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 family and our defense businesses. Ducommun's commercial fixed-wing business grew in aggregate over 26% versus last year, underscoring our position to both Boeing and Airbus, where we provide important content. On the MAX, we've continued to ship and support the monthly rate of [ 42] for Boeing and [ 52] for Spirit. We currently see no change in the current build schedule. And as stated in the past, the Boeing reduction is not material to Ducommun. We also continued to work closely with them and currently have the manufacturing capacity and ability to support the ramp up of any increase in the build schedule in the future. 
As you know, we're also broadly diversified across numerous commercial platforms, including now Airbus. Our business with them, again, posted strong gains year-over-year. We now have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us. Gulfstream is also growing, another bright spot in the quarter with the production increases on the G Series aircraft. Our defense business had an excellent quarter as well, with a 13% increase in revenue. Ducommun's had strong performance on many of its key missile programs, aircraft platforms such as the F-35 and the Apache helicopter. We remain confident in continued growth in this important segment, which provides great balance to the overall company, combined with our commercial aerospace business. 
We also ended the quarter with a backlog of $835 million, near record levels, with a healthy balance of both commercial and military orders. The strength of our backlog certainly underscores the diversity of our product offerings and the long-term demand for the platforms we serve. 
Another highlight in the quarter was continued strong margin expansion, with gross margins rising 170 basis points year-over-year to 21.2% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2018. Ducommun's operating margin also expanded 160 basis points to 8.1% versus an adjusted 6.5% last year. That's excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. The performance was driven by our Structures segment, where operating margins expanded to 14.2% due to improved operating leverage, successful implementation of our performance center strategy, Ducommun's operating system and pricing discipline. 
We also posted a strong increase of 31% of adjusted EBITDA to nearly $24 million for the quarter over the comparable period in 2018. I'm obviously thrilled by the many meaningful accomplishments of our team and the company's overall operating results as I will finish off my third year at Ducommun in January. 
After the quarter ended, we also announced the acquisition of Noble's worldwide, a global leader in the design and support of ammunition handling systems. This company has been in business for over 70 years. Supply advanced tactical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles in the U.S. and overseas. It's a great fit for Ducommun's [indiscernible] this platform, opening new market opportunities with aftermarket support. 
In addition, roughly 43% of the revenue is from international sales, expanding our presence abroad. Nobles is just the latest transaction that accomplishes the strategy I've discussed in the past [indiscernible] proprietary engineered product companies with an intellectual property to our market-leading with aftermarket support and future growth opportunities. 
I do also want to mention at this time that the purchase price of Nobles and the other 2 acquisitions completed since 2017 were below 10x EBITDA multiple for each one based on the LTM at the time of the purchase. 
As we've communicated at Investor Day last year, we disclosed the information required by regulations, along with some other selective details, but limit certain data for competitive reasons. However, I thought it was best to share this with investors and analysts today due to recent speculation in the press that we paid a much higher multiple for Nobles on an EBITDA basis, and we did not. 
I also want to reiterate, and as I've spoken in the past, Ducommun leadership team are senior executives with both Fortune 100 and top 5 private equity backgrounds. We have a strong acquisition process, significant experience and discipline. 
Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $80.5 million, up 13% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. For example, we saw a double-digit growth in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18, and the Joint Strike Fighter, along with the Apache helicopter program and several missile defense applications, including the Patriot, Mir, J Sale and Felix. The sheer number of such strong performing platforms exemplifies the demand for our products across the defense market for which we're proud. We ended the quarter with the military space backlog of approximately $372 million, continuing a steady trend of growth in this area, which we expect will continue into fiscal 2020. With our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose 16% year-over-year to $88.9 million. As I mentioned earlier, growth was again fueled by large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family. 
In fact, most of our Boeing and Airbus platforms grew double digits. And for the second quarter in a row, the A320 was our second highest revenue-generating commercial platform after the 737. Our rapid growth with Airbus reflects the strength of Ducommun's portfolio and the value provided to this customer. We also continue to see strong growth with Gulfstream this quarter as well as on other commercial helicopter platforms. 
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $430 million at the end of the quarter, declining from earlier levels in the year due to order timing. We remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of our product lines and key platforms we serve heading into 2020. 
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,640837576,1846790,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business cont",981,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call. 
During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business continue the themes of favorable year-over-year trends in certain key metrics, including top line growth, margin expansion and adjusted EBITDA, our Ducommun operatin gsystem and its performance center focused-factory approach has been a key in helping drive continued improvement of the year-over-year operating results, including areas such as customer satisfaction and scrap as well as performing in a more consistent and predictable manner. 
Now I'll move to the details of the overall results. A review of the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $181.1 million versus $159.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. This performance includes $9 million higher sales within the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $12.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $835 million, which is still near record levels. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.2% in the third quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving enhanced operating performance. This resulted in favorable production volumes, favorable product mix and increased manufacturing efficiencies. 
SG&A was $23.7 million in the third quarter versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting higher other corporate-related costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the prior year included an aggregate total of $3.7 million of restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $10.5 million or 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. 
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $2.5 million last year due to higher interest rates. As a result of utilizing our credit facility to fund the company's Nobles acquisition subsequent to quarter-end, we do expect interest expense to increase accordingly going forward. The company reported net income for the third quarter of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.2 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges and other adjustments were also lower year-over-year by $3.7 million, offset by $2.8 million in higher SG&A, $1.9 million of increased interest expense and higher income taxes of $1.8 million. 
Adjusted net income was $7.2 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the 2018 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 180 basis points. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $85.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue versus $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructure charges last year, electronics adjusted operating margin was 11.9% for the 2018 third quarter, with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $74.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $12.4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $4 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $4 million or 5.3% of revenue last year. Excluding restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structures adjusted operating margin was 7.9% for the 2018 third quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving elevated operating performance. These resulted in favorable production volume, favorable production mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies, along with lower restructure charges in the current year. 
Corporate general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue versus $6.2 million or 3.9% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year results reflect higher other corporate expenses of $1 million and higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the current year. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $7.2 million during the third quarter of 2018, reflecting our higher net income this year. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.5 million during the third quarter and are on track to spend $16 million to $18 million during 2019 to support new program wins. We're again pleased with our quarterly performance and remain positive about the future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

267761,640837576,1846884,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. A",1079,"Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As mentioned in the press release this afternoon, I'm very happy with our third quarter results and continued strong performance of the company. Now having as well 5 straight quarters of double-digit revenue increases, averaging 15% with over 85% of the gains organic.
Ducommun's revenue for the third quarter also grew at 13% year-over-year to $181 million, driven by increased shipments on large narrow-body aircraft platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 family, and our defense businesses. Ducommun's commercial fixed-wing business grew in aggregate over 26% versus last year, underscoring our position to both Boeing and Airbus, where we provide important content. On the MAX, we've continued to ship and support the monthly rate of 42 for Boeing and 52 for Spirit. We currently see no change in the current build schedule and I stated in the past, the Boeing reduction is not material to Ducommun. We also continue to work closely with them and currently have the manufacturing capacity and ability to support the ramp up of any increase in the build schedule in the future. 
As you know, we're also broadly diversified across numerous commercial platforms, including now Airbus. Our business with them, again, posted strong gains year-over-year. We now have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us. Gulfstream is also growing, another bright spot in the quarter with the production increases on the G series aircraft. Our defense business had an excellent quarter as well, with a 13% increase in revenue. Ducommun had strong performance on many of its key missile programs, aircraft platforms such as the F-35 and the Apache helicopter. We remain confident in continued growth in this important segment, which provides great balance to the overall company, combined with our commercial aerospace business.
We also ended the quarter with a backlog of $835 million, near-record levels, with a healthy balance of both commercial and military orders. The strength of our backlog certainly underscores the diversity of our product offerings and the long-term demand for the platforms we serve.
Another highlight in the quarter was continued strong margin expansion, with gross margins rising 170 basis points year-over-year to 21.2% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2018. Ducommun's operating margin also expanded 160 basis points to 8.1% versus an adjusted 6.5% last year. That's excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. This performance was driven by our Structures segment, where operating margins expanded to 14.2% due to improved operating leverage, successful implementation of our performance center strategy, Ducommun's operating system and pricing discipline. 
We also posted a strong increase of 31% of adjusted EBITDA to nearly $24 million for the quarter over the comparable period in 2018. I'm obviously thrilled by the many meaningful accomplishments of our team and the company's overall operating results as I will finish with my third year at Ducommun in January.
After the quarter ended, we also announced the acquisition of Nobles Worldwide, a global leader in the design and support of ammunition handling systems. This company has been in business for over 70 years, supply advanced tactical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles in the U.S. and overseas. It's a great fit for Ducommun's [indiscernible] platform, opening new market opportunities with aftermarket support.
In addition, roughly 43% of the revenue is from international sales, expanding our presence abroad. Nobles is just the latest transaction that accomplishes the strategy I've discussed in the past, to acquire proprietary engineered product companies with [indiscernible] property to our market-leading with aftermarket support and future growth opportunities. 
I do also want to mention at this time that the purchase price of Nobles and the other 2 acquisitions completed since 2017 were below a 10x EBITDA multiple for each one based on the LTM at the time of the purchase.
As we've communicated in Investor Day last year, we disclosed the information required by regulations along with some other selective details but limit certain data for competitive reasons. However, I thought it was best to share this with investors and analysts today due to recent speculation in the press that we paid a much higher multiple for Nobles on an EBITDA basis, and we did not.
I also want to reiterate, and as I've spoken in the past, Ducommun leadership team or senior executives to both Fortune 100 and top 5 private equity backgrounds. We have a strong acquisition process, significant experience and discipline. 
Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $80.5 million, up 13% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. For example, we saw a double-digit growth in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18, and the Joint Strike Fighter, along with the Apache helicopter program and several missile defense applications, including the [ Patriot, Embraer, JSOW and Phalanx. The sheer number of such strong performing platforms exemplifies the demand for our products across the defense market for which we're proud. We ended the quarter with the military space backlog of approximately $372 million continuing a steady trend of growth in this area, which we expect will continue into fiscal 2020. 
Our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose 16% year-over-year to $88.9 million. As I mentioned earlier, growth was again fueled by large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family.  In fact, most of our Boeing and Airbus platforms grew double digits. And for the second quarter in a row, the A320 was our second-highest revenue-generating commercial platform after the 737. Our rapid growth with Airbus reflects the strength of Ducommun's portfolio and the value provided to this customer. We also continue to see strong growth with Gulfstream this quarter as well as on other commercial helicopter platforms.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $430 million at the end of the quarter, declining from earlier levels in the year due to order timing.

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business conti",981,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.
During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business continue the themes of favorable year-over-year trends in certain key metrics, including top line growth, margin expansion and adjusted EBITDA. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach has been a key in helping drive continued improvement of the year-over-year operating results, including areas such as customer satisfaction and scrap as well as performing in a more consistent and predictable manner. 
Now I'll move to the details of the overall results. A review of the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $181.1 million versus $159.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. This performance includes $9 million higher sales within the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $12.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $835 million, which is still near record levels. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.2% in the third quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving enhanced operating performance. This resulted in favorable production volumes, favorable product mix and increased manufacturing efficiencies.
SG&A was $23.7 million in the third quarter versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting higher other corporate-related costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the prior year included an aggregate total of $3.7 million of restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $10.5 million or 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $2.5 million last year due to higher interest rates. As a result of utilizing our credit facility to fund the company's Nobles acquisition subsequent to quarter end, we do expect interest expense to increase accordingly going forward. The company reported net income for the third quarter of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.2 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges and other adjustments were also lower year-over-year by $3.7 million, offset by $2.8 million in higher SG&A, $1.9 million of increased interest expense and higher income taxes of $1.8 million.
Adjusted net income was $7.2 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the 2018 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 180 basis points. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $85.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue versus $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructure charges last year, electronics adjusted operating margin was 11.9% for the 2018 third quarter with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $74.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $12.4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $4 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $4 million or 5.3% of revenue last year. Excluding restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structures adjusted operating margin was 7.9% for the 2018 third quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving elevated operating performance. These resulted in favorable production volume, favorable production mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies, along with lower restructure charges in the current year.
Corporate general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue versus $6.2 million or 3.9% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year results reflect higher other corporate expenses of $1 million and higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the current year. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $7.2 million during the third quarter of 2018, reflecting our higher net income this year. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.5 million during the third quarter and are on track to spend $16 million to $18 million during 2019 to support new program wins. We're, again, pleased with our quarterly performance and remain positive about the future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

So these things take time, and nothing's really changed there either. We'll just have to see but the pipeline's been pretty good."

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail.",1077,"Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As mentioned in the press release this afternoon, I'm very happy with our third quarter results and continued strong performance of the company. Now having as well 5 straight quarters of double-digit revenue increases, averaging 15% with over 85% of the gains organic.
Ducommun's revenue for the third quarter also grew at 13% year-over-year to $181 million, driven by increased shipments on large narrow-body aircraft platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 family, and our defense businesses. Ducommun's commercial fixed-wing business grew in aggregate over 26% versus last year, underscoring our position to both Boeing and Airbus, where we provide important content. 
On the MAX, we've continued to ship and support the monthly rate of 42 for Boeing and 52 for Spirit. We currently see no change in the current build schedule and I stated in the past, the Boeing reduction is not material to Ducommun. We also continue to work closely with them and currently have the manufacturing capacity and ability to support the ramp-up of any increase in the build schedule in the future. 
As you know, we're also broadly diversified across numerous commercial platforms, including now Airbus. Our business with them, again, posted strong gains year-over-year. We now have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us. Gulfstream is also growing, another bright spot in the quarter with the production increases on the G series aircraft. Our defense business had an excellent quarter as well, with a 13% increase in revenue. Ducommun had strong performance on many of its key missile programs, aircraft platforms such as the F-35 and the Apache helicopter. We remain confident in continued growth in this important segment, which provides great balance to the overall company, combined with our commercial aerospace business.
We also ended the quarter with a backlog of $835 million, near-record levels, with a healthy balance of both commercial and military orders. The strength of our backlog certainly underscores the diversity of our product offerings and the long-term demand for the platforms we serve.
Another highlight in the quarter was continued strong margin expansion, with gross margins rising 170 basis points year-over-year to 21.2% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2018. Ducommun's operating margin also expanded 160 basis points to 8.1% versus an adjusted 6.5% last year. That's excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. This performance was driven by our Structures segment, where operating margins expanded to 14.2% due to improved operating leverage, successful implementation of our performance center strategy, Ducommun's operating system and pricing discipline. 
We also posted a strong increase of 31% of adjusted EBITDA to nearly $24 million for the quarter over the comparable period in 2018. I'm obviously thrilled by the many meaningful accomplishments of our team and the company's overall operating results as I will finish with my third year at Ducommun in January.
After the quarter ended, we also announced the acquisition of Nobles Worldwide, a global leader in the design and support of ammunition handling systems. This company has been in business for over 70 years, supply advanced tactical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles in the U.S. and overseas. It's a great fit for Ducommun's business platform, opening new market opportunities with aftermarket support.
In addition, roughly 43% of the revenue is from international sales, expanding our presence abroad. Nobles is just the latest transaction that accomplishes the strategy I've discussed in the past, to acquire proprietary engineered product companies with intellectual property who our market-leading with aftermarket support and future growth opportunities. 
I do also want to mention at this time that the purchase price of Nobles and the other 2 acquisitions completed since 2017 were below a 10x EBITDA multiple for each one, based on the LTM at the time of the purchase.
As we've communicated in Investor Day last year, we disclosed the information required by regulations along with some other selective details but limit certain data for competitive reasons. However, I thought it was best to share this with investors and analysts today due to recent speculation in the press that we paid a much higher multiple for Nobles on an EBITDA basis, and we did not.
I also want to reiterate, and as I've spoken in the past, Ducommun leadership team are senior executives with both Fortune 100 and top 5 private equity backgrounds. We have a strong acquisition process, significant experience and discipline. 
Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $80.5 million, up 13% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. 
For example, we saw a double-digit growth in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18, and the Joint Strike Fighter, along with the Apache helicopter program and several missile defense applications, including the Patriot, MIR, JSOW and Phalanx. The sheer number of such strong performing platforms exemplifies the demand for our products across the defense market for which we're proud. We ended the quarter with a military space backlog of approximately $372 million, continuing a steady trend of growth in this area, which we expect will continue into fiscal 2020. 
Our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose 16% year-over-year to $88.9 million. As I mentioned earlier, growth was again fueled by large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family. In fact, most of our Boeing and Airbus platforms grew double digits. And for the second quarter in a row, the A320 was our second-highest revenue-generating commercial platform after the 737. Our rapid growth with Airbus reflects the strength of Ducommun's portfolio and the value provided to this customer. We also continue to see strong growth with Gulfstream this quarter as well as on other commercial helicopter platforms.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $430 million at the end of the quarter, declining from earlier levels in the year due to order timing. We remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of our product lines and key platforms we serve heading into 2020.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,640837576,1851083,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business conti",981,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.
During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business continue the themes of favorable year-over-year trends in certain key metrics, including top line growth, margin expansion and adjusted EBITDA. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach has been a key in helping drive continued improvement of the year-over-year operating results, including areas such as customer satisfaction and scrap as well as performing in a more consistent and predictable manner. 
Now I'll move to the details of the overall results. A review of the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $181.1 million versus $159.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. This performance includes $9 million higher sales within the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $12.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $835 million, which is still near record levels. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.2% in the third quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving enhanced operating performance. This resulted in favorable production volumes, favorable product mix and increased manufacturing efficiencies.
SG&A was $23.7 million in the third quarter versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting higher other corporate-related costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the prior year included an aggregate total of $3.7 million of restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $10.5 million or 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $2.5 million last year due to higher interest rates. As a result of utilizing our credit facility to fund the company's Nobles acquisition subsequent to quarter end, we do expect interest expense to increase accordingly going forward. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.2 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges and other adjustments were also lower year-over-year by $3.7 million, offset by $2.8 million in higher SG&A, $1.9 million of increased interest expense and higher income taxes of $1.8 million.
Adjusted net income was $7.2 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the 2018 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 180 basis points. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $85.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue versus $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructure charges last year, electronics adjusted operating margin was 11.9% for the 2018 third quarter with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $74.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $12.4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $4 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $4 million or 5.3% of revenue last year. Excluding restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structures adjusted operating margin was 7.9% for the 2018 third quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving elevated operating performance. These resulted in favorable production volume, favorable production mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies, along with lower restructure charges in the current year.
Corporate, general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue versus $6.2 million or 3.9% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year results reflect higher other corporate expenses of $1 million and higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the current year. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $7.2 million during the third quarter of 2018, reflecting our higher net income this year. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.5 million during the third quarter and are on track to spend $16 million to $18 million during 2019 to support new program wins. We're, again, pleased with our quarterly performance and remain positive about the future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As mentioned in the press release this afternoon, I'm very happy with our third quarter results and continued strong performance of the company. Now having as well 5 straight quarters of double-digit revenue increases, averaging 15% with over 85% of the gains organic.
Ducommun's revenue for the third quarter also grew at 13% year-over-year to $181 million, driven by increased shipments on large narrow-body aircraft platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 family, and our defense businesses. Ducommun's commercial fixed-wing business grew in aggregate over 26% versus last year, underscoring our position to both Boeing and Airbus, where we provide important content. 
On the MAX, we've continued to ship and support the monthly rate of 42 for Boeing and 52 for Spirit. We currently see no change in the current build schedule and I stated in the past, the Boeing reduction is not material to Ducommun. We also continue to work closely with them and currently have the manufacturing capacity and ability to support the ramp-up of any increase in the build schedule in the future. 
As you know, we're also broadly diversified across numerous commercial platforms, including now Airbus. Our business with them, again, posted strong gains year-over-year. We now have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us. Gulfstream is also growing, another bright spot in the quarter with the production increases on the G series aircraft. Our defense business had an excellent quarter as well, with a 13% increase in revenue. Ducommun had strong performance on many of its key missile programs, aircraft platforms such as the F-35 and the Apache helicopter. We remain confident in continued growth in this important segment, which provides great balance to the overall company, combined with our commercial aerospace business.
We also ended the quarter with a backlog of $835 million, near-record levels, with a healthy balance of both commercial and military orders. The strength of our backlog certainly underscores the diversity of our product offerings and the long-term demand for the platforms we serve.
Another highlight in the quarter was continued strong margin expansion, with gross margins rising 170 basis points year-over-year to 21.2% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2018. Ducommun's operating margin also expanded 160 basis points to 8.1% versus an adjusted 6.5% last year. That's excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. This performance was driven by our Structures segment, where operating margins expanded to 14.2% due to improved operating leverage, successful implementation of our performance center strategy, Ducommun's operating system and pricing discipline. 
We also posted a strong increase of 31% of adjusted EBITDA to nearly $24 million for the quarter over the comparable period in 2018. I'm obviously thrilled by the many meaningful accomplishments of our team and the company's overall operating results as I will finish with my third year at Ducommun in January.
After the quarter ended, we also announced the acquisition of Nobles Worldwide, a global leader in the design and support of ammunition handling systems. This company has been in business for over 70 years, supply advanced tactical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles in the U.S. and overseas. It's a great fit for Ducommun's business platform, opening new market opportunities with aftermarket support.
In addition, roughly 43% of the revenue is from international sales, expanding our presence abroad. Nobles is just the latest transaction that accomplishes the strategy I've discussed in the past, to acquire proprietary engineered product companies with intellectual property who our market-leading with aftermarket support and future growth opportunities. 
I do also want to mention at this time that the purchase price of Nobles and the other 2 acquisitions completed since 2017 were below a 10x EBITDA multiple for each one, based on the LTM at the time of the purchase.
As we've communicated in Investor Day last year, we disclosed the information required by regulations along with some other selective details but limit certain data for competitive reasons. However, I thought it was best to share this with investors and analysts today due to recent speculation in the press that we paid a much higher multiple for Nobles on an EBITDA basis, and we did not.
I also want to reiterate, and as I've spoken in the past, Ducommun leadership team are senior executives with both Fortune 100 and top 5 private equity backgrounds. We have a strong acquisition process, significant experience and discipline. 
Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $80.5 million, up 13% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. 
For example, we saw a double-digit growth in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18, and the Joint Strike Fighter, along with the Apache helicopter program and several missile defense applications, including the Patriot, MIR, JSOW and Phalanx. The sheer number of such strong performing platforms exemplifies the demand for our products across the defense market for which we're proud. We ended the quarter with a military space backlog of approximately $372 million, continuing a steady trend of growth in this area, which we expect will continue into fiscal 2020. 
Our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose 16% year-over-year to $88.9 million. As I mentioned earlier, growth was again fueled by large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family. In fact, most of our Boeing and Airbus platforms grew double digits. And for the second quarter in a row, the A320 was our second-highest revenue-generating commercial platform after the 737. Our rapid growth with Airbus reflects the strength of Ducommun's portfolio and the value provided to this customer. We also continue to see strong growth with Gulfstream this quarter as well as on other commercial helicopter platforms.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $430 million at the end of the quarter, declining from earlier levels in the year due to order timing. We remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of our product lines and key platforms we serve heading into 2020.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"

As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business conti",981,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.
During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business continue the themes of favorable year-over-year trends in certain key metrics, including top line growth, margin expansion and adjusted EBITDA. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach has been a key in helping drive continued improvement of the year-over-year operating results, including areas such as customer satisfaction and scrap as well as performing in a more consistent and predictable manner. 
Now I'll move to the details of the overall results. A review of the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $181.1 million versus $159.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. This performance includes $9 million higher sales within the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $12.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $835 million, which is still near record levels. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.2% in the third quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving enhanced operating performance. This resulted in favorable production volumes, favorable product mix and increased manufacturing efficiencies.
SG&A was $23.7 million in the third quarter versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting higher other corporate-related costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the prior year included an aggregate total of $3.7 million of restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $10.5 million or 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $2.5 million last year due to higher interest rates. As a result of utilizing our credit facility to fund the company's Nobles acquisition subsequent to quarter end, we do expect interest expense to increase accordingly going forward. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.2 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges and other adjustments were also lower year-over-year by $3.7 million, offset by $2.8 million in higher SG&A, $1.9 million of increased interest expense and higher income taxes of $1.8 million.
Adjusted net income was $7.2 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the 2018 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 180 basis points. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $85.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue versus $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructure charges last year, electronics adjusted operating margin was 11.9% for the 2018 third quarter with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $74.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $12.4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $4 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $4 million or 5.3% of revenue last year. Excluding restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structures adjusted operating margin was 7.9% for the 2018 third quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving elevated operating performance. These resulted in favorable production volume, favorable production mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies, along with lower restructure charges in the current year.
Corporate, general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue versus $6.2 million or 3.9% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year results reflect higher other corporate expenses of $1 million and higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the current year. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $7.2 million during the third quarter of 2018, reflecting our higher net income this year. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.5 million during the third quarter and are on track to spend $16 million to $18 million during 2019 to support new program wins. We're, again, pleased with our quarterly performance and remain positive about the future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."

Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail.",1077,"Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. As usual, I'll begin by providing an update on recent developments at the company, after which Chris Wampler will review our financials in detail. 
As mentioned in the press release this afternoon, I'm very happy with our third quarter results and continued strong performance of the company. Now having as well 5 straight quarters of double-digit revenue increases, averaging 15% with over 85% of the gains organic.
Ducommun's revenue for the third quarter also grew at 13% year-over-year to $181 million, driven by increased shipments on large narrow-body aircraft platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 family, and our defense businesses. Ducommun's commercial fixed-wing business grew in aggregate over 26% versus last year, underscoring our position to both Boeing and Airbus, where we provide important content. 
On the MAX, we've continued to ship and support the monthly rate of 42 for Boeing and 52 for Spirit. We currently see no change in the current build schedule and I stated in the past, the Boeing reduction is not material to Ducommun. We also continue to work closely with them and currently have the manufacturing capacity and ability to support the ramp-up of any increase in the build schedule in the future. 
As you know, we're also broadly diversified across numerous commercial platforms, including now Airbus. Our business with them, again, posted strong gains year-over-year. We now have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us. Gulfstream is also growing, another bright spot in the quarter with the production increases on the G series aircraft. Our defense business had an excellent quarter as well, with a 13% increase in revenue. Ducommun had strong performance on many of its key missile programs, aircraft platforms such as the F-35 and the Apache helicopter. We remain confident in continued growth in this important segment, which provides great balance to the overall company, combined with our commercial aerospace business.
We also ended the quarter with a backlog of $835 million, near-record levels, with a healthy balance of both commercial and military orders. The strength of our backlog certainly underscores the diversity of our product offerings and the long-term demand for the platforms we serve.
Another highlight in the quarter was continued strong margin expansion, with gross margins rising 170 basis points year-over-year to 21.2% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2018. Ducommun's operating margin also expanded 160 basis points to 8.1% versus an adjusted 6.5% last year. That's excluding restructuring charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. This performance was driven by our Structures segment, where operating margins expanded to 14.2% due to improved operating leverage, successful implementation of our performance center strategy, Ducommun's operating system and pricing discipline. 
We also posted a strong increase of 31% of adjusted EBITDA to nearly $24 million for the quarter over the comparable period in 2018. I'm obviously thrilled by the many meaningful accomplishments of our team and the company's overall operating results as I will finish with my third year at Ducommun in January.
After the quarter ended, we also announced the acquisition of Nobles Worldwide, a global leader in the design and support of ammunition handling systems. This company has been in business for over 70 years, supply advanced tactical products for a variety of aircraft, naval vessels and military vehicles in the U.S. and overseas. It's a great fit for Ducommun's business platform, opening new market opportunities with aftermarket support.
In addition, roughly 43% of the revenue is from international sales, expanding our presence abroad. Nobles is just the latest transaction that accomplishes the strategy I've discussed in the past, to acquire proprietary engineered product companies with intellectual property who our market-leading with aftermarket support and future growth opportunities. 
I do also want to mention at this time that the purchase price of Nobles and the other 2 acquisitions completed since 2017 were below a 10x EBITDA multiple for each one, based on the LTM at the time of the purchase.
As we've communicated in Investor Day last year, we disclosed the information required by regulations along with some other selective details but limit certain data for competitive reasons. However, I thought it was best to share this with investors and analysts today due to recent speculation in the press that we paid a much higher multiple for Nobles on an EBITDA basis, and we did not.
I also want to reiterate, and as I've spoken in the past, Ducommun leadership team are senior executives with both Fortune 100 and top 5 private equity backgrounds. We have a strong acquisition process, significant experience and discipline. 
Now let me provide some color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector, we posted third quarter revenue of $80.5 million, up 13% over 2018, reflecting stronger sales across a number of missile and defense programs. 
For example, we saw a double-digit growth in shipments for the F-15, F-16, F-18, and the Joint Strike Fighter, along with the Apache helicopter program and several missile defense applications, including the Patriot, MIR, JSOW and Phalanx. The sheer number of such strong performing platforms exemplifies the demand for our products across the defense market for which we're proud. We ended the quarter with a military space backlog of approximately $372 million, continuing a steady trend of growth in this area, which we expect will continue into fiscal 2020. 
Our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter sales rose 16% year-over-year to $88.9 million. As I mentioned earlier, growth was again fueled by large, fixed-wing, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family. In fact, most of our Boeing and Airbus platforms grew double digits. And for the second quarter in a row, the A320 was our second-highest revenue-generating commercial platform after the 737. Our rapid growth with Airbus reflects the strength of Ducommun's portfolio and the value provided to this customer. We also continue to see strong growth with Gulfstream this quarter as well as on other commercial helicopter platforms.
The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector stood at roughly $430 million at the end of the quarter, declining from earlier levels in the year due to order timing. We remain optimistic about the commercial market, given the breadth of our product lines and key platforms we serve heading into 2020.
With that, I'll have Chris review our financial results in detail. Chris?"
267761,640837576,1852053,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business conti",981,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, please see the company's filings and today's press release for further description of matters under discussion during the call.
During 2019, we have seen the performance of the business continue the themes of favorable year-over-year trends in certain key metrics, including top line growth, margin expansion and adjusted EBITDA. Our Ducommun operating system and its performance-center-focused factory approach has been a key in helping drive continued improvement of the year-over-year operating results, including areas such as customer satisfaction and scrap as well as performing in a more consistent and predictable manner. 
Now I'll move to the details of the overall results. A review of the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $181.1 million versus $159.8 million in the third quarter of 2018. This performance includes $9 million higher sales within the military and space sector, primarily reflecting strong demand for various missile programs and $12.6 million of greater revenue from our commercial aerospace customers due to increased shipments for key narrow-body platforms such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, as Steve mentioned. Ducommun's overall backlog as of the end of the third quarter was approximately $835 million, which is still near record levels. As a reminder, the company defines backlog as potential revenue and is based on the customer-placed purchase orders and long-term agreements, with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 21.2% in the third quarter versus 19.5% in the prior year's comparable period. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving enhanced operating performance. This resulted in favorable production volumes, favorable product mix and increased manufacturing efficiencies.
SG&A was $23.7 million in the third quarter versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily reflecting higher other corporate-related costs and higher compensation and benefit costs. The company reported operating income for the third quarter of $14.6 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $6.8 million or 4.3% of revenue in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher revenue, higher gross profit and the prior year included an aggregate total of $3.7 million of restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $10.5 million or 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Interest expense was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $2.5 million last year due to higher interest rates. As a result of utilizing our credit facility to fund the company's Nobles acquisition subsequent to quarter end, we do expect interest expense to increase accordingly going forward. 
The company reported net income for the third quarter of $8.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $7.2 million of higher gross profit. Restructuring charges and other adjustments were also lower year-over-year by $3.7 million, offset by $2.8 million in higher SG&A, $1.9 million of increased interest expense and higher income taxes of $1.8 million.
Adjusted net income was $7.2 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the 2018 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was $23.6 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $18.1 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of 180 basis points. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $90.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $85.7 million in the prior year period. These results reflect a $5 million increase in sales to our military and space customers. Commercial aerospace shipments were relatively flat year-over-year. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $9.7 million or 10.7% of revenue versus $9.1 million or 10.6% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructure charges last year, electronics adjusted operating margin was 11.9% for the 2018 third quarter with the year-over-year decline reflecting product mix. 
Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $90.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 versus $74.1 million last year. The year-over-year increase was due to $12.4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, primarily large airframe single-aisle platforms and a $4 million increase in revenue within the company's military and space markets. Structural Systems posted operating income for the quarter of $12.9 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $4 million or 5.3% of revenue last year. Excluding restructured charges and inventory purchase accounting adjustments, Structures adjusted operating margin was 7.9% for the 2018 third quarter. The year-over-year operating margin improvement reflects improved operating leverage at the performance centers, driving elevated operating performance. These resulted in favorable production volume, favorable production mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies, along with lower restructure charges in the current year.
Corporate, general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.9 million or 4.4% of revenue versus $6.2 million or 3.9% of revenue in 2018. The year-over-year results reflect higher other corporate expenses of $1 million and higher compensation and benefit costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the current year. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $12 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $7.2 million during the third quarter of 2018, reflecting our higher net income this year. In terms of capital expenditures, we spent $4.5 million during the third quarter and are on track to spend $16 million to $18 million during 2019 to support new program wins. We're, again, pleased with our quarterly performance and remain positive about the future results. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."
