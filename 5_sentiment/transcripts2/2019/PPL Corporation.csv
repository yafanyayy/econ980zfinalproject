We're pleased that you've joined us for our 2018 year end earnings call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the Heads of our U.S. Utility Businesses; and Phil Swift, who was recently named Chief Executive of Western Power Distribution in the U.K. following the unfortunate passing of Robert Symons in November.
While we are deeply saddened by Robert's passing and he will be sorely missed, we are very fortunate to have Phil, who has a wealth of experience with over 25 years at WPD. I have great confidence in Phil's ability to lead our tremendous team there and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution, established by Robert over the past 20 years. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of 2018 results and PPL's business outlook for 2019. I'll also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed financial review of 2018 and 2019 and the discussion on our earnings guidance for 2021. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4, 2018 marked another successful year for PPL as we delivered on our strategy of best in sector operational performance, investing in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation and engaging and developing our people. We closed the year with strong operational and financial results. As announced earlier today, we achieved the high end of our 2018 ongoing earnings forecast range for $2.40 per share. 
2018 was the ninth consecutive year that we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. It was the second straight year that we achieved the high end of our forecast. We're very proud of this track record of financial performance. It reflects our emphasis on execution and operational excellence across the regulated businesses, which included minimizing regulatory lag and achieving the allowed returns set by each regulatory jurisdiction, which we accomplished in 2018.  This was paramount in delivering a 7% increase in ongoing earnings from 2017 results, while also strengthening the balance sheet, post tax reform. 
Focused on maintaining a strong financial foundation, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward to mitigate tax reform impacts, strengthen future credit metrics and support our solid investment grade credit rating. As for investing in a sustainable energy future, we successfully completed about $3.5 billion of infrastructure improvements in 2018. In Pennsylvania, we installed approximately 1.2 million new meters, keeping us well on pace to conclude our advanced metering project in 2019. 
We also continue to strengthen our transmission system to improve grid security and resiliency. In Kentucky, we continue to make progress on a multiyear project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants. We ramped up investment in Smart Grid technology on our distribution and transmission systems to more quickly detect outages and restore power.  And we put the finishing touches on the modernization project at our Ohio Falls hydroelectric facility, increasing the generating capacity from 80 to 100 megawatts. 
In the U.K., we have executed on our asset replacement and fault management plans. We continue to incorporate more automation on our networks and advance numerous low carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of distributed energy resources. 
In addition to delivering strong financial results through our infrastructure investments, we continue to make progress in pursuit of our strategy to deliver best in sector operational performance. Our utilities remained among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. These achievements represent the 46th and 47th J.D. Power awards earned by our domestic utilities. 
Meanwhile, our 4 U.K. distribution network operating companies remained the top 4 performers in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction for the regulatory year, ended March of 2018. WPD also ranked best among U.K. operators in stakeholder engagement and addressing vulnerable customers, which are important areas for Ofgem and they did this for the seventh straight year. 
At the same time, safety and reliability across our businesses remained strong in 2018. All 3 of our domestic utility companies were recognized as top quartile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. In addition and for the second straight year, PPL electric posted its best year ever for safety. 
These achievements reflect the common purpose and desire across our businesses to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to improve performance each and every day. 
On the regulatory front, I'd like to highlight our efforts in Pennsylvania in establishing a means for alternative ratemaking for stake utilities. We view this as a very important piece of legislation, as it grants the ability to develop additional regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling and incentive-based rates. 
Also in 2018, we continue to invest in our employees, developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees. While we need to continuously focus attention in this area, I'm proud to report that PPL was recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best employers in 2018. Our Pennsylvania operations were also recognized as Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion and received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. 
Turning to our 2019 outlook on Slide 5, today, we initiated formal 2019 earnings guidance of $2.30 a share to $2.50 a share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2018 actual to the 2019 forecast earnings later in his remarks.
Our projected 2019 results keep us firmly on track to achieve the 5% to 6% growth target for ongoing EPS through 2020, which we reaffirmed today. We also initiated a projected earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share for 2021. 
Turning to our dividend, today we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.65 per share. PPL has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1946. In addition, the company has increased its dividend 17x over the past 18 years. We remain committed to dividend growth as this is an important piece of our overall share and return proposition. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend in the context of our yield and payout ratio, relative to peers. 
In terms of network investment for 2019, we plan to put another $3.3 billion into our utilities, which we will continue to support the efforts to improve the customer experience and resiliency of the grid. As reflected in our 2018 results, our investments are driving better operational performance. We expect this trend to continue as we make these additional investments. 
Finally, we will remain focused on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, our rate review, which takes a combined revenue increase of $172 million, continues to proceed as scheduled before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our rate requests are being made to support additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, stronger and more resilient, to replace aging natural gas lines and to support additional powerplant performance and reliability improvements. All these investments are expected to further improve service to our customers. 
In the U.K., we continue to work with Ofgem to develop the rules that may be used to shape the framework for the next price control, which begins in 2023 for electric distribution utilities. 
Turning to Slide 6, we wanted to clarify and outline some observations about Ofgem's recent RIIO-2 consultation document that pertains to the electric transmission and gas subsectors. That consultation document, which was issued in December, does not apply to the electricity distribution network operators, including our U.K. company, Western Power Distribution or WPD. In addition, it does not impact WPD's current business plans that extend through March of 2023 or it does not impact WPD's operations. 
It is important to note that this is a consultation and Ofgem is seeking comment from a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure the best outcome. The comment period on that consultation ends March 14, 2019, with the decision expected by Ofgem in May. 
In that consultation document, the proposed returns for gas and transmission were lower than we expected. They are based on current market conditions and other proposed methodologies, on which Ofgem is seeking input and comments. Also in that document, Ofgem proposes to index the cost of equity to risk-free rates, which are currently negative in the U.K. 
Given we are years away from settling our tariffs or setting them for the electric distribution sector and market rates are currently near record lows, we believe there is potential upside from current market conditions in terms of the cost of equity that we will be receiving in RIIO-ED2. We also expect that incentives will play a significant role in RIIO-2 based on the subsector consultation. We recognize that this will be an area of key debate as it represents a significant opportunity in driving operational efficiency and returns. 
While it's not clear how incentives will be structured for electric distribution networks at this time, we expect that Ofgem will be more focused on differentiating returns and provide substantial opportunities for the top performers. WPD is well-positioned with its strong track record of superior customer service and reliability. Further, we see ample opportunity for continued RAV growth through RIIO-2 to support replacement of aging infrastructure and the investment demands of U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. 
PPL and WPD will continue to monitor Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process and provide input and engage with Ofgem to ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders. 
Lastly, even though the current consultation for transmission and gas does not apply to WPD, we would still encourage our investors and others to provide their feedback and views to Ofgem on this consultation. It is critically important that Ofgem hears from all stakeholders during the consultation. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for addi",1846,"Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for additional details on the fourth quarter results. 
Today, we announced 2018 reported earnings of $2.58 per share compared to $1.64 per share a year ago. 2018 reported earnings reflect net special item benefits of $0.18 per share, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges, 2017 reported results reflect net special item expenses of $0.61 per share, primarily due to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform and the unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 
Adjusting for these special items, 2018 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.40 per share compared to $2.25 per share a year ago. The solid execution of our business plan and benefits from weather during the year enabled us to achieve the high end of our ongoing earnings guidance range.  Looking at 2019 as Bill indicated, we announced formal guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
As you may recall, we accelerated the timing of some planned equity issuances into 2018 and 2019 as a result of U.S. tax reform to support our credit metrics and significant capital investment program. While this results in higher dilution in 2018 and 2019, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth through 2020 based on the 2018 original ongoing earnings guidance midpoint of $2.30 per share.  In addition, we continue to project growth through 2021 and have initiated a guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, which I will discuss in detail in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a detailed review of 2018 financial results. Overall, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth at each of our operating companies, driven by our substantial investment and ability to earn our allowed returns. Excluding the $0.07 per share impact from dilution, 2018 financial results grew nearly 10% from 2017 results. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher adjusted gross margins, the higher foreign currency translation rate and higher pension income for the U.K. segment. The positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. A portion of the adjusted gross margin increase, which driven by higher sales volumes due to weather was about $0.11 per share, primarily at our domestic utilities. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, starting with the U.K., our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.36 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, driven by the April 1, 2018 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017 of $0.13, and other primarily due to an increase in expected pension asset returns on higher asset balances. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and higher income taxes, primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes as a result of a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower Federal tax rate resulting from U.S. tax reform.
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, $0.13 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins of $0.15 per share, primarily resulting from results on additional transmission capital investments, higher distribution sales volumes, including $0.03 due to weather and higher zonal peak load. Note that adjusted gross margins for both Pennsylvania and Kentucky reflect the impact of lower collected taxes in revenues, which is offset in taxes in driving the significant tax benefit reflected on the slide.  Higher adjusted gross margins in Pennsylvania were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to asset additions and higher financing costs. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.59 per share in 2018, a $0.04 year-over-year increase from 2017, excluding the impact of dilution. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins of $0.16 per share, excluding the effect of tax reform that has offset [indiscernible]. The increase in gross margins was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather of $0.06, higher base electricity and gas rates, effective July 1, 2017 and returns on additional environment capital investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.
Turning to corporate and other, we experienced a $0.07 decrease, driven by higher taxes due to reduced tax benefits as a result of lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and higher financing costs. 
Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 10, we began with our strong 2018 results and adjust for the significant weather benefits experienced this past year, which results in 2018 weather normalized ongoing earnings of $2.32 per share. I'll use that as a base in explaining the year-over-year drivers for comparability purposes. From that base, we project earnings per share growth at each of our segments, excluding $0.13 of dilution as a result of settling the remaining 43 million shares of common stock under our forward equity sales agreements that we completed in May of 2018. You'll see on the slide that we detailed the $0.13 of dilution by segment. 
Looking at the operational drivers, excluding the dilution, in the U.K. segment, we expect to deliver higher earnings of $0.13 per share compared to 2018. This increase is expected to result from higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2019 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rate and other primarily due to pensions. This is partially offset by higher interest expense from incremental debt issuances and higher income taxes. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher earnings of $0.02 per share. Higher transmission margins and lower O&M expenses are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we are projecting a $0.04 increase in earnings per share. This is expected to be driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates and return on additional environmental capital investments. This is partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher depreciation and higher interest expense due to planned debt issuances. 
Turning to Slide 11, today, we initiated a guidance range for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. Our high-level underlying assumptions are reflected on this slide, which begin with our ratebase and returns. Ratebase continues to grow at a steady pace of 5% to 6%, given the substantial investment opportunities we have in each of the utilities. In terms of ROEs, our terms -- our teams have done an excellent job of maintaining strong returns at or near their allowed levels through cost management, utilization of favorable recovery mechanisms and achieving performance incentives. We are confident that we will continue to execute at that high-level as we have demonstrated consistently. 
We've also updated our assumptions regarding U.K. pensions, interest under recovery and various other true up mechanisms under the U.K. regulatory framework. In total, we are projecting these adjustments to impact 2021 earnings in the range of negative $0.05 to negative $0.10 per share compared to 2020's estimated earnings. 
In terms of foreign currency for 2021, we are using a range of $1.35 on the low side and $1.60 on the high side. $1.35 represents forward rates in the low end of our bank forecast for 2021, $1.60 reflects the higher end of the bank forecast for '21 and the historical average for the GDP rate. I'll touch on our foreign currency hedging status in a few moments.
Overall, our sensitivity on a fully opened position remains at about $0.01 change in the currency rates, [indiscernible] $0.01 change in EPS. 
Moving to Slide 12, our planned capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 are detailed on the slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $14.5 billion over the period. In the U.K, we are projecting over $5.5 billion of capital investment over the next 5 years. There have not been significant changes to our U.K. capital plans as those have already been accepted by Ofgem through the end of RIIO-ED1.  As we think about future spending beyond the current price control period, the electric distribution sector will have significant opportunities to deploy incremental capital, given the UK's electrification initiatives. 
Turning to Pennsylvania, we are projecting about $4.5 billion of investment over the next 5 years, with the majority of the investment in transmission, as we continue our focus on grid resiliency and modernization. There are also no significant changes to report in our Pennsylvania capital plan, with a slight increase driven by additional reliability in other projects in providing our electric service to our customers. 
Finally, in Kentucky, we are projecting more than $4.5 billion of investment over that period. We made a few changes to the Kentucky Capital Plan in this update. First, we included some incremental infrastructure projects and some environmental spending related to compliance with the fluent limitation guidance. In total, this was about $425 million of incremental capital. However, we also updated the Kentucky Capital Plan to remove about $275 million for the advanced metering system project. We continue to believe the AMS project will benefit our customers and we expect to continue to seek approval from the KPSC for this project. 
Similar to prior years, we only include identified projects with a high probability of certainty in our capital plan. We will update our capital plan at the appropriate time for normal course, along with any additional capital spending opportunities across our utilities as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. 
Let's move to Slide 13 to close with a discussion on our foreign currency strategy.  As we outlined at the beginning of 2018, our foreign currency hedge percentages are back within the rolling 36-month targeted ranges established under our risk management framework. As a reminder, those hedge ranges are as follows: 70% to 100% hedged for the next 12 months; 30% to 70% for the second 12 months; and 0% to 30% hedged for the third 12 months. We remain fully hedged through 2019 and about 50% hedged for 2020 at hedge rates well above current market rates, which should support our earnings translations through the volatile periods surrounding Brexit. 
We continue to believe that there will be upside to the current rates as we move past the political uncertainty in the U.K. We will continue to be opportunistic in our hedging execution as we have done historically. 
You can see on the right side of the page that most bank forecast remain above the current forwards, especially for 2021. We continue to maintain our budgeted rate for open positions at [ $1.40 per GBP 1 ] for 2020 and as I mentioned earlier, we are using a range of $1.35 to $1.60 per GBP 1 for the low and high ranges for our 2020 guidance. 
That concludes my prepared to marks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Relative to the amount that we're collecting, it's about $180 million of revenue that we're collecting in pension deficit funding. We -- based on the current assumptions and as Vince noted, the lower asset returns and balances, we believe are still going to require continue deficit funding, certainly, over the next several years. So just for sensitivity purposes, as we noted, we stressed it, another $0.05 in the low case. So the primary drivers to the high and low guidance range that we gave are the FX and the U.K. pension and other true ups which we discussed.

One is -- and you kind of alluded to it as inflation to the extent that inflation is driving the RPI or CPI in the U.K., upwards, which it has been. That's actually a positive because that creates incremental revenue for us. So -- and certainly, we've seen some benefit from that here lately. I think also incremental cost efficiency, we've done an excellent job both in the U.K. and the domestic utilities to really try to take cost out wherever we can. And that's certainly an area that we're going to continue to look at. I think the other things are customer load growth. I think you'll see that with our year end 2018 on a weather adjusted basis, we did see some uptick in loan growth. I'm not sure that that's indicative of what we're going to see going forward but built into our plan is actually slightly negative load growth. So certainly, anything flat to positive will be upside to the current plan and then of course, regulatory outcomes, we can always, whether it be Kentucky or Pennsylvania, could help lift earnings higher as well. So those are just some of the other ones that I would add and potentially, incremental CapEx towards the back end of the plan, as Vince mentioned, our CapEx plan is really based on kind of specific projects that we've already know about and have high confidence that we can execute on. But I'm sure that there will be additional governmental CapEx as we look forward to the back end of the plan."

So starting from that base, number one would be probably an expectation that we're not going to be in a negative risk-free return environment by the time our ROE is actually set. So that would probably be point number one. Point number two would be the upside potential from incentive revenue that we've had a long history of doing very, very well at. The third element would probably be the shift from fast pot to slow pot, putting more of our revenue into the -- if you want to call it the fast pot, the operating and  maintenance kind of bucket and a little bit less than the CapEx for slow pot bucket. And I believe that was about 100 -- it would have been about $140 million had we shifted out about 10%. In the current RIIO-ED1 regulatory process. Other potential upsides, we are not -- we know that Ofgem is going to have a keen focus on how do they incentivize the electric distribution companies to meet some of the clean energy objectives, policy objectives in the U.K. and we believe that's going to result in some other opportunities, whether that be CapEx or otherwise. But also in our case, the one element that we do have that we mentioned earlier on the pension deficit funding that's about $180 million that could be converted from arguably less quality earnings to more higher quality earnings through additional CapEx that we could spend and still not raise customer rates, because of that reduction coming off the pension deficit [indiscernible] replace it with something that's going to be longer term on earnings driver. So those are -- I would say, the major drivers as we look to RIIO-ED2, which again, doesn't start for us until April of 2023."

So I don't think you're necessarily going to see the same level of adjustment for the electric description companies as what's being contemplated for gas. In our conversations with Ofgem and they've made it clear in the consultation that this does not apply to the electric distribution. They reaffirmed that to us in our direct conversations with them and as Bill said, I think we all agree that there will be additional capital requirements going into electric distribution in RIIO-2 as compared to RIIO-1 to meet all of the electrification needs. So again, our sense is that Ofgem will ultimately, for the electric distribution companies, come out with the returns to incentivize that investment."

If we determine that, the solid sales growth that we're seeing in 2018 is not just the weather anomaly and that actually continues going forward, that would provide some upside to that base number.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the Heads of our U.S. Utility Businesses; and Phil Swift, who was recently named Chief Executive of Western Power Distribution in the U.K. following the unfortunate passing of Robert Symons in November.
While we are deeply saddened by Robert's passing and he will be sorely missed, we are very fortunate to have Phil, who has a wealth of experience with over 25 years at WPD. I have great confidence in Phil's ability to lead our tremendous team there and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution established by Robert over the past 20 years. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of 2018 results and PPL's business outlook for 2019. I'll also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed financial review of 2018 and 2019 and the discussion on our earnings guidance for 2021. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. 2018 marked another successful year for PPL as we delivered on our strategy of best-in-sector operational performance, investing in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation, and engaging and developing our people. We closed the year with strong operational and financial results. As announced earlier today, we achieved the high end of our 2018 ongoing earnings forecast range or $2.40 per share. 
2018 was the ninth consecutive year that we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. It was the second straight year that we achieved the high end of our forecast. We're very proud of this track record of financial performance. It reflects our emphasis on execution and operational excellence across the regulated businesses, which included minimizing regulatory lag and achieving the allowed returns set by each regulatory jurisdiction, which we accomplished in 2018. This was paramount in delivering a 7% increase in ongoing earnings from 2017 results while also strengthening the balance sheet post-tax reform. 
Focused on maintaining a strong financial foundation, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward to mitigate tax reform impacts, strengthen future credit metrics and support our solid investment-grade credit rating. As for investing in a sustainable energy future, we successfully completed about $3.5 billion of infrastructure improvements in 2018.
In Pennsylvania, we installed approximately 1.2 million new meters, keeping us well on pace to conclude our advanced metering project in 2019. We also continued to strengthen our transmission system to improve grid security and resiliency.
In Kentucky, we continue to make progress on a multiyear project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants. We ramped up the investment in Smart Grid technology on our distribution and transmission systems to move -- or quickly detect outages and restore power. And we put the finishing touches on the modernization project at our Ohio Falls hydroelectric facility, increasing the generating capacity from 80 to 100 megawatts. 
In the U.K., we have executed on our asset replacement and fault management plans. We continue to incorporate more automation on our networks and advance numerous low carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of distributed energy resources.
In addition to delivering strong financial results through our infrastructure investments, we continue to make progress in pursuit of our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance. Our utilities remained among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. These achievements represent the 46th and 47th J.D. Power awards earned by our domestic utilities. 
Meanwhile, our 4 U.K. distribution network operating companies remained the top 4 performers in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction for the regulatory year ended March of 2018. WPD also ranked best among U.K. operators in stakeholder engagement and addressing vulnerable customers, which are important areas for Ofgem, and they did this for the seventh straight year. 
At the same time, safety and reliability across our businesses remained strong in 2018. All 3 of our domestic utility companies were recognized as top quartile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. In addition and for the second straight year, PPL Electric posted its best year ever for safety. 
These achievements reflect the common purpose and desire across our businesses to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to improve performance each and every day. 
On the regulatory front, I'd like to highlight our efforts in Pennsylvania in establishing a means for alternative ratemaking for state utilities. We view this as a very important piece of legislation as it grants the ability to develop additional regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling and incentive-based rates. 
Also in 2018, we continue to invest in our employees, developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees. While we need to continuously focus attention in this area, I'm proud to report that PPL was recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best employers in 2018. Our Pennsylvania operations were also recognized as Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion and received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. 
Turning to our 2019 outlook on Slide 5. Today, we initiated formal 2019 earnings guidance of $2.30 a share to $2.50 a share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2018 actual to the 2019 forecast earnings later in his remarks.
Our projected 2019 results keep us firmly on track to achieve the 5% to 6% growth target for ongoing EPS through 2020, which we reaffirm today. We also initiated a projected earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share for 2021. 
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.65 per share. PPL has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1946. In addition, the company has increased its dividend 17x over the past 18 years. We remain committed to dividend growth as this is an important piece of our overall shareowner return proposition. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend in the context of our yield and payout ratio relative to peers. 
In terms of network investment for 2019, we plan to put another $3.3 billion into our utilities, which we will continue to support the efforts to improve the customer experience and resiliency of the grid. As reflected in our 2018 results, our investments are driving better operational performance. We expect this trend to continue as we make these additional investments. 
Finally, we will remain focused on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, our rate review, which takes a combined revenue increase of $172 million, continues to proceed as scheduled before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our rate requests are being made to support additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, stronger and more resilient, to replace aging natural gas lines and to support additional power plant performance and reliability improvements. All these investments are expected to further improve service to our customers. 
In the U.K., we continue to work with Ofgem to develop the rules that may be used to shape the framework for the next price control, which begins in 2023 for electric distribution utilities. 
Turning to Slide 6. We wanted to clarify and outline some observations about Ofgem's recent RIIO-2 consultation document that pertains to the electric transmission and gas subsectors. That consultation document, which was issued in December, does not apply to the electricity distribution network operators, including our U.K. company, Western Power Distribution or WPD. In addition, it does not impact WPD's current business plans that extend through March of 2023 or it does not impact WPD's operations. 
It is important to note that this is a consultation, and Ofgem is seeking comment from a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure the best outcome. The comment period on that consultation ends March 14, 2019, with the decision expected by Ofgem in May. In that consultation document, the proposed returns for gas and transmission were lower than we expected. They are based on current market conditions and other proposed methodologies on which Ofgem is seeking input and comments.
Also in that document, Ofgem proposes to index the cost of equity to risk-free rates, which are currently negative in the U.K. Given we are years away from settling our tariffs or setting them for the electric distribution sector and market rates are currently near record lows, we believe there is potential upside from current market conditions in terms of the cost of equity that we will be receiving in RIIO-ED2. We also expect that incentives will play a significant role in RIIO-2 based on the subsector consultation.
We recognize that this will be an area of key debate as it represents a significant opportunity in driving operational efficiency and returns. While it's not clear how incentives will be structured for electric distribution networks at this time, we expect that Ofgem will be more focused on differentiating returns and provide substantial opportunities for the top performers. 
WPD is well-positioned with its strong track record of superior customer service and reliability. Further, we see ample opportunity for continued RAV growth through RIIO-2 to support replacement of aging infrastructure and the investment demands of U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. PPL and WPD will continue to monitor Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process and provide input and engage with Ofgem to ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders. 
Lastly, even though the current consultation for transmission and gas does not apply to WPD, we would still encourage our investors and others to provide their feedback and views to Ofgem on this consultation. It is critically important that Ofgem hears from all stakeholders during the consultation. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"
185508,600193011,1656800,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2019",2019-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for add",1847,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for additional details on the fourth quarter results. 
Today, we announced 2018 reported earnings of $2.58 per share compared to $1.64 per share a year ago. 2018 reported earnings reflect net special item benefits of $0.18 per share, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 2017 reported results reflect net special item expenses of $0.61 per share, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 
Adjusting for these special items, 2018 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.40 per share compared to $2.25 per share a year ago. The solid execution of our business plan and benefits from weather during the year enabled us to achieve the high end of our ongoing earnings guidance range.  Looking at 2019, as Bill indicated, we announced formal guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
As you may recall, we accelerated the timing of some planned equity issuances into 2018 and 2019 as a result of U.S. tax reform to support our credit metrics and significant capital investment program. While this results in higher dilution in 2018 and 2019, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth through 2020 based on the 2018 original ongoing earnings guidance midpoint of $2.30 per share. In addition, we continue to project growth through 2021 and have initiated a guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, which I will discuss in detail in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a detailed review of 2018 financial results. Overall, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth at each of our operating companies, driven by our substantial investment and ability to earn our allowed returns. Excluding the $0.07 per share impact from dilution, 2018 financial results grew nearly 10% from 2017 results. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher adjusted gross margins, the higher foreign currency translation rate and higher pension income for the U.K. segment. The positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. A portion of the adjusted gross margin increase, which is driven by higher sales volumes due to weather, was about $0.11 per share, primarily at our domestic utilities. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.36 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins driven by the April 1, 2018 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017 of $0.13, and other primarily due to an increase in expected pension asset returns on higher asset balances. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and higher income taxes, primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes as a result of a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower federal tax rate resulting from U.S. tax reform.
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, a $0.13 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins of $0.15 per share, primarily resulting from results on additional transmission capital investments, higher distribution sales volumes, including $0.03 due to weather, and higher zonal peak load. Note that adjusted gross margins for both Pennsylvania and Kentucky reflect the impact of lower collected taxes and revenues, which is offset in taxes in driving the significant tax benefit reflected on the slide. Higher adjusted gross margins in Pennsylvania were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to asset additions and higher financing costs. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.59 per share in 2018, a $0.04 year-over-year increase from 2017 excluding the impact of dilution. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins of $0.16 per share, excluding the effect of tax reform that has offset taxes. The increase in gross margins was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather of $0.06, higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and returns on additional environment capital investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.
Turning to Corporate and Other, we experienced a $0.07 decrease, driven by higher taxes due to reduced tax benefits as a result of lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and higher financing costs. 
Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 10. We began with our strong 2018 results and adjust for the significant weather benefits experienced this past year, which results in 2018 weather normalized ongoing earnings of $2.32 per share. I'll use that as a base in explaining the year-over-year drivers for comparability purposes. From that base, we project earnings per share growth at each of our segments, excluding $0.13 of dilution as a result of settling the remaining 43 million shares of common stock under our forward equity sales agreements that we completed in May of 2018. You'll see on the slide that we detailed the $0.13 of dilution by segment. 
Looking at the operational drivers, excluding the dilution, in the U.K. segment, we expect to deliver higher earnings of $0.13 per share compared to 2018. This increase is expected to result from higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2019 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rate and other primarily due to pensions. This is partially offset by higher interest expense from incremental debt issuances and higher income taxes. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher earnings of $0.02 per share. Higher transmission margins and lower O&M expenses are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we are projecting a $0.04 increase in earnings per share. This is expected to be driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates, and return on additional environmental capital investments. This is partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher depreciation and higher interest expense due to planned debt issuances. 
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we initiated a guidance range for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. Our high-level underlying assumptions are reflected on this slide, which begin with our rate base and returns. Rate base continues to grow at a steady pace of 5% to 6%, given the substantial investment opportunities we have in each of the utilities.
In terms of ROEs, our terms have -- our teams have done an excellent job of maintaining strong returns at or near their allowed levels through cost management, utilization of favorable recovery mechanisms and achieving performance incentives. We are confident that we will continue to execute at that high level as we have demonstrated consistently. 
We've also updated our assumptions regarding U.K. pensions, interest under-recovery and various other true-up mechanisms under the U.K. regulatory framework. In total, we are projecting these adjustments to impact 2021 earnings in the range of negative $0.05 to negative $0.10 per share compared to 2020's estimated earnings. 
In terms of foreign currency for 2021, we are using a range of $1.35 on the low side and $1.60 on the high side. $1.35 represents forward rates in the low end of our bank forecast for 2021. $1.60 reflects the higher end of the bank forecast for '21 and the historical average for the GDP rate. I'll touch on our foreign currency hedging status in a few moments.
Overall, our sensitivity on a fully opened position remains at about $0.01 change in the currency rate equaling a $0.01 change in EPS. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our planned capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 are detailed on the slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $14.5 billion over the period. In the U.K., we are projecting over $5.5 billion of capital investment over the next 5 years. There had not been significant changes to our U.K. capital plans as those have already been accepted by Ofgem through the end of RIIO-ED1. As we think about future spending beyond the current price control period, the electric distribution sector will have significant opportunities to deploy incremental capital, given the U.K.'s electrification initiatives. 
Turning to Pennsylvania, we are projecting about $4.5 billion of investment over the next 5 years, with the majority of the investment in transmission as we continue our focus on grid resiliency and modernization. There are also no significant changes to report in our Pennsylvania capital plan, with a slight increase driven by additional reliability in other projects in providing our electric service to our customers. 
Finally, in Kentucky, we are projecting more than $4.5 billion of investment over that period. We made a few changes to the Kentucky capital plan in this update. First, we included some incremental infrastructure projects and some environmental spending related to compliance with effluent limitation guidelines. In total, this was about $425 million of incremental capital. However, we also updated the Kentucky capital plan to remove about $275 million for the advanced metering system project.
We continue to believe the AMS project will benefit our customers, and we expect to continue to seek approval from the KPSC for this project. Similar to prior years, we only include identified projects with a high probability of certainty in our capital plan. We will update our capital plan at the appropriate time per normal course, along with any additional capital spending opportunities across our utilities as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. 
Let's move to Slide 13 to close with a discussion on our foreign currency strategy. As we outlined at the beginning of 2018, our foreign currency hedge percentages are back within the rolling 36-month targeted ranges established under our risk management framework. As a reminder, those hedge ranges are as follows: 70% to 100% hedged for the next 12 months; 30% to 70% for the second 12 months; and 0% to 30% hedged for the third 12 months. We remain fully hedged through 2019 and about 50% hedged for 2020 at hedge rates well above current market rates, which should support our earnings translation through the volatile periods surrounding Brexit. 
We continue to believe that there will be upside to the current rates as we move past the political uncertainty in the U.K. We will continue to be opportunistic in our hedging execution as we have done historically. 
You can see on the right side of the page that most bank forecast remain above the current forwards, especially for 2021. We continue to maintain our budgeted rate for open positions at $1.40 per GBP 1 for 2020. And as I mentioned earlier, we are using a range of $1.35 to $1.60 per GBP 1 for the low and high ranges of our 2021 guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Relative to the amount that we're collecting, it's about $180 million of revenue that we're collecting in pension deficit funding. Based on the current assumptions and as Vince noted, the lower asset returns and balances, we believe, are still going to require continued deficit funding certainly over the next several years. So just for sensitivity purposes, as we noted, we stressed it, another $0.05 in the low case. So the primary drivers to the high and low guidance range that we gave are the FX and the U.K. pension and other true-ups, which we discussed. Relative to the more detailed question, I'll turn that over to Vince."

So any true-up that would be required there would be trued up in the '23-'24 timeframe. So that just gives you a sense of how this process and how these adjustments will play out."

One is, and you kind of alluded to it, is inflation to the extent that inflation is driving the RPI or CPI in the U.K. upwards, which it has been. That's actually a positive because that creates incremental revenue for us. So -- and certainly, we've seen some benefit from that here lately. I think also incremental cost efficiency, we've done an excellent job both in the U.K. and the domestic utilities to really try to take cost out wherever we can. And that's certainly an area that we're going to continue to look at. I think the other things are customer and load growth. I think you see that with our year-end 2018 on a weather-adjusted basis, we did see some uptick in load growth. I'm not sure that that's indicative of what we're going to see going forward, but built into our plan is actually slightly negative load growth. So certainly anything kind of flat to positive will be upside to the current plan. And then, of course, regulatory outcomes could always, whether it be in Kentucky or Pennsylvania, could help lift earnings higher as well. So those are just some of the other ones that I would add. And potentially, incremental CapEx towards the back end of the plan. As Vince mentioned, our CapEx plan is really just based on kind of specific projects that we already know about and have high confidence that we can execute on. But I'm sure that there will be additional incremental CapEx as we look towards the back end of the plan."

When you look at where this sort of -- this 3% number that they are testing to starting in terms of ROE, how do you think about walking that up to what you think you'll really be, what the real earnings opportunity is going to look like? Because I think in prior conversations, you've talked about how that really masks an opportunity when you add everything up to get back to the types of returns on equity, they're kind of consistent with what we earn here in the U.S."

So starting from that base, number one would be probably an expectation that we're not going to be in a negative risk-free return environment by the time our ROE is actually set. So that would be probably point number one. Point number two would be the upside potential from incentive revenue that we've had a long history of doing very, very well at. The third element would probably be the shift from fast pot to slow pot, putting more of our revenue into the -- oh, if you want to call it the fast pot, the operating and  maintenance kind of bucket and a little bit less than the CapEx for slow pot bucket. And I believe that was about 100 -- would have been about $140 million had we shifted that about 10% in the current RIIO-ED1 regulatory process. Other potential upsides, we are not -- we know that Ofgem is going to have a keen focus on how do they incentivize the electric distribution companies to meet some of the clean energy objectives, policy objectives in the U.K. And we believe that's going to result in some other opportunities, whether that be CapEx or otherwise. But also in our case, the one element that we do have that we mentioned earlier on the pension deficit funding that's $180 million that could be converted from arguably less quality earnings to more higher quality earnings through additional CapEx that we could spend and still not raise customer rates. Because of that reduction coming off the pension deficit, we can replace it with something that's going to be, longer term, an earnings driver. So those are, I would say, the major drivers as we look to RIIO-ED2, which again doesn't start for us until April of 2023."

We've -- in our conversations with Ofgem, and they've made it clear in the consultation that this does not apply to electric distribution, they reaffirmed that to us in our direct conversations with them. And as Bill said, I think we all agree that there will be additional capital requirements going into electric distribution in RIIO-2 as compared to RIIO-1 to meet all of the electrification needs. And so again, our sense is that Ofgem will, ultimately, for the electric distribution companies, come out with their returns to incentivize that investment."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the Heads of our U.S. Utility Businesses; and Phil Swift, who was recently named Chief Executive of Western Power Distribution in the U.K. following the unfortunate passing of Robert Symons in November.
While we are deeply saddened by Robert's passing and he will be sorely missed, we are very fortunate to have Phil, who has a wealth of experience with over 25 years at WPD. I have great confidence in Phil's ability to lead our tremendous team there and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution established by Robert over the past 20 years. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of 2018 results and PPL's business outlook for 2019. I'll also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed financial review of 2018 and 2019 and the discussion on our earnings guidance for 2021. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. 2018 marked another successful year for PPL as we delivered on our strategy of best-in-sector operational performance, investing in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation, and engaging and developing our people. We closed the year with strong operational and financial results. As announced earlier today, we achieved the high end of our 2018 ongoing earnings forecast range or $2.40 per share. 
2018 was the ninth consecutive year that we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. It was the second straight year that we achieved the high end of our forecast. We're very proud of this track record of financial performance. It reflects our emphasis on execution and operational excellence across the regulated businesses, which included minimizing regulatory lag and achieving the allowed returns set by each regulatory jurisdiction, which we accomplished in 2018. This was paramount in delivering a 7% increase in ongoing earnings from 2017 results while also strengthening the balance sheet post-tax reform. 
Focused on maintaining a strong financial foundation, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward to mitigate tax reform impacts, strengthen future credit metrics and support our solid investment-grade credit rating. As for investing in a sustainable energy future, we successfully completed about $3.5 billion of infrastructure improvements in 2018.
In Pennsylvania, we installed approximately 1.2 million new meters, keeping us well on pace to conclude our advanced metering project in 2019. We also continued to strengthen our transmission system to improve grid security and resiliency.
In Kentucky, we continue to make progress on a multiyear project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants. We ramped up the investment in Smart Grid technology on our distribution and transmission systems to more quickly detect outages and restore power. And we put the finishing touches on the modernization project at our Ohio Falls hydroelectric facility, increasing the generating capacity from 80 to 100 megawatts. 
In the U.K., we have executed on our asset replacement and fault management plans. We continue to incorporate more automation on our networks and advance numerous low carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of distributed energy resources.
In addition to delivering strong financial results through our infrastructure investments, we continue to make progress in pursuit of our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance. Our utilities remained among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. These achievements represent the 46th and 47th J.D. Power awards earned by our domestic utilities. 
Meanwhile, our 4 U.K. distribution network operating companies remained the top 4 performers in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction for the regulatory year ended March of 2018. WPD also ranked best among U.K. operators in stakeholder engagement and addressing vulnerable customers, which are important areas for Ofgem, and they did this for the seventh straight year. 
At the same time, safety and reliability across our businesses remained strong in 2018. All 3 of our domestic utility companies were recognized as top quartile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. In addition and for the second straight year, PPL Electric posted its best year ever for safety. 
These achievements reflect the common purpose and desire across our businesses to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to improve performance each and every day. 
On the regulatory front, I'd like to highlight our efforts in Pennsylvania in establishing a means for alternative ratemaking for state utilities. We view this as a very important piece of legislation as it grants the ability to develop additional regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling and incentive-based rates. 
Also in 2018, we continue to invest in our employees, developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees. While we need to continuously focus attention in this area, I'm proud to report that PPL was recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best employers in 2018. Our Pennsylvania operations were also recognized as Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion and received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. 
Turning to our 2019 outlook on Slide 5. Today, we initiated formal 2019 earnings guidance of $2.30 a share to $2.50 a share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2018 actual to the 2019 forecast earnings later in his remarks.
Our projected 2019 results keep us firmly on track to achieve the 5% to 6% growth target for ongoing EPS through 2020, which we reaffirm today. We also initiated a projected earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share for 2021. 
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.65 per share. PPL has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1946. In addition, the company has increased its dividend 17x over the past 18 years. We remain committed to dividend growth as it is an important piece of our overall shareowner return proposition. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend in the context of our yield and payout ratio relative to peers. 
In terms of network investment for 2019, we plan to put another $3.3 billion into our utilities, which we will continue to support the efforts to improve the customer experience and resiliency of the grid. As reflected in our 2018 results, our investments are driving better operational performance. We expect this trend to continue as we make these additional investments. 
Finally, we will remain focused on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, our rate review, which takes a combined revenue increase of $172 million, continues to proceed as scheduled before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our rate requests are being made to support additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, stronger and more resilient, to replace aging natural gas lines and to support additional power plant performance and reliability improvements. All these investments are expected to further improve service to our customers. 
In the U.K., we continue to work with Ofgem to develop the rules that may be used to shape the framework for the next price control, which begins in 2023 for electric distribution utilities. 
Turning to Slide 6. We wanted to clarify and outline some observations about Ofgem's recent RIIO-2 consultation document that pertains to the electric transmission and gas subsectors. That consultation document, which was issued in December, does not apply to the electricity distribution network operators, including our U.K. company, Western Power Distribution or WPD. In addition, it does not impact WPD's current business plans that extend through March of 2023 or it does not impact WPD's operations. 
It is important to note that this is a consultation, and Ofgem is seeking comment from a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure the best outcome. The comment period on that consultation ends March 14, 2019, with the decision expected by Ofgem in May. In that consultation document, the proposed returns for gas and transmission were lower than we expected. They are based on current market conditions and other proposed methodologies on which Ofgem is seeking input and comments.
Also in that document, Ofgem proposes to index the cost of equity to risk-free rates, which are currently negative in the U.K. Given we are years away from settling our tariffs or setting them for the electric distribution sector and market rates are currently near record lows, we believe there is potential upside from current market conditions in terms of the cost of equity that we will be receiving in RIIO-ED2. We also expect that incentives will play a significant role in RIIO-2 based on the subsector consultation.
We recognize that this will be an area of key debate as it represents a significant opportunity in driving operational efficiency and returns. While it's not clear how incentives will be structured for electric distribution networks at this time, we expect that Ofgem will be more focused on differentiating returns and provide substantial opportunities for the top performers. 
WPD is well-positioned with its strong track record of superior customer service and reliability. Further, we see ample opportunity for continued RAV growth through RIIO-2 to support replacement of aging infrastructure and the investment demands of U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. PPL and WPD will continue to monitor Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process and provide input and engage with Ofgem to ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders. 
Lastly, even though the current consultation for transmission and gas does not apply to WPD, we would still encourage our investors and others to provide their feedback and views to Ofgem on this consultation. It is critically important that Ofgem hears from all stakeholders during the consultation. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"
185508,600193011,1657172,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2019",2019-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for add",1846,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for additional details on the fourth quarter results. 
Today, we announced 2018 reported earnings of $2.58 per share compared to $1.64 per share a year ago. 2018 reported earnings reflect net special item benefits of $0.18 per share, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 2017 reported results reflect net special item expenses of $0.61 per share, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 
Adjusting for these special items, 2018 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.40 per share compared to $2.25 per share a year ago. The solid execution of our business plan and benefits from weather during the year enabled us to achieve the high end of our ongoing earnings guidance range.  Looking at 2019, as Bill indicated, we announced formal guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
As you may recall, we accelerated the timing of some planned equity issuances into 2018 and 2019 as a result of U.S. tax reform to support our credit metrics and significant capital investment program. While this results in higher dilution in 2018 and 2019, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth through 2020 based on the 2018 original ongoing earnings guidance midpoint of $2.30 per share. In addition, we continue to project growth through 2021 and have initiated a guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, which I will discuss in detail in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a detailed review of 2018 financial results. Overall, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth at each of our operating companies, driven by our substantial investment and ability to earn our allowed returns. Excluding the $0.07 per share impact from dilution, 2018 financial results grew nearly 10% from 2017 results. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher adjusted gross margins, the higher foreign currency translation rate and higher pension income for the U.K. segment. The positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. A portion of the adjusted gross margin increase was driven by higher sales volumes due to weather, was about $0.11 per share, primarily at our domestic utilities. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.36 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins driven by the April 1, 2018 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017 of $0.13, and other primarily due to an increase in expected pension asset returns on higher asset balances. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and higher income taxes, primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes as a result of a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower federal tax rate resulting from U.S. tax reform.
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, a $0.13 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins of $0.15 per share, primarily resulting from results on additional transmission capital investments, higher distribution sales volumes, including $0.03 due to weather, and higher zonal peak load. Note that adjusted gross margins for both Pennsylvania and Kentucky reflect the impact of lower collected taxes and revenues, which is offset in taxes in driving the significant tax benefit reflected on the slide. Higher adjusted gross margins in Pennsylvania were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to asset additions and higher financing costs. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.59 per share in 2018, a $0.04 year-over-year increase from 2017 excluding the impact of dilution. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins of $0.16 per share, excluding the effect of tax reform that has offset taxes. The increase in gross margins was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather of $0.06, higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and returns on additional environment capital investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.
Turning to Corporate and Other, we experienced a $0.07 decrease, driven by higher taxes due to reduced tax benefits as a result of lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and higher financing costs. 
Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 10. We began with our strong 2018 results and adjust for the significant weather benefits experienced this past year, which results in 2018 weather normalized ongoing earnings of $2.32 per share. I'll use that as a base in explaining the year-over-year drivers for comparability purposes. From that base, we project earnings per share growth at each of our segments, excluding $0.13 of dilution as a result of settling the remaining 43 million shares of common stock under our forward equity sales agreements that we completed in May of 2018. You'll see on the slide that we detailed the $0.13 of dilution by segment. 
Looking at the operational drivers, excluding the dilution, in the U.K. segment, we expect to deliver higher earnings of $0.13 per share compared to 2018. This increase is expected to result from higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2019 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rate and other primarily due to pensions. This is partially offset by higher interest expense from incremental debt issuances and higher income taxes. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher earnings of $0.02 per share. Higher transmission margins and lower O&M expenses are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we are projecting a $0.04 increase in earnings per share. This is expected to be driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates, and return on additional environmental capital investments. This is partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher depreciation and higher interest expense due to planned debt issuances. 
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we initiated a guidance range for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. Our high-level underlying assumptions are reflected on this slide, which begin with our rate base and returns. Rate base continues to grow at a steady pace of 5% to 6%, given the substantial investment opportunities we have in each of the utilities.
In terms of ROEs, our terms have -- our teams have done an excellent job of maintaining strong returns at or near their allowed levels through cost management, utilization of favorable recovery mechanisms and achieving performance incentives. We are confident that we will continue to execute at that high level as we have demonstrated consistently. 
We've also updated our assumptions regarding U.K. pensions, interest under-recovery and various other true-up mechanisms under the U.K. regulatory framework. In total, we are projecting these adjustments to impact 2021 earnings in the range of negative $0.05 to negative $0.10 per share compared to 2020's estimated earnings. 
In terms of foreign currency for 2021, we are using a range of $1.35 on the low side and $1.60 on the high side. $1.35 represents forward rates in the low end of our bank forecast for 2021. $1.60 reflects the higher end of the bank forecast for '21 and the historical average for the GBP rate. I'll touch on our foreign currency hedging status in a few moments.
Overall, our sensitivity on a fully opened position remains at about $0.01 change in the currency rate equaling a $0.01 change in EPS. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our planned capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 are detailed on the slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $14.5 billion over the period. In the U.K., we are projecting over $5.5 billion of capital investment over the next 5 years. There have not been significant changes to our U.K. capital plans as those have already been accepted by Ofgem through the end of RIIO-ED1. As we think about future spending beyond the current price control period, the electric distribution sector will have significant opportunities to deploy incremental capital, given the U.K.'s electrification initiatives. 
Turning to Pennsylvania, we are projecting about $4.5 billion of investment over the next 5 years, with the majority of the investment in transmission as we continue our focus on grid resiliency and modernization. There are also no significant changes to report in our Pennsylvania capital plan, with a slight increase driven by additional reliability in other projects in providing our electric service to our customers. 
Finally, in Kentucky, we are projecting more than $4.5 billion of investment over that period. We made a few changes to the Kentucky capital plan in this update. First, we included some incremental infrastructure projects and some environmental spending related to compliance with effluent limitation guidelines. In total, this was about $425 million of incremental capital. However, we also updated the Kentucky capital plan to remove about $275 million for the advanced metering system project.
We continue to believe the AMS project will benefit our customers, and we expect to continue to seek approval from the KPSC for this project. Similar to prior years, we only include identified projects with a high probability of certainty in our capital plan. We will update our capital plan at the appropriate time per normal course, along with any additional capital spending opportunities across our utilities as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. 
Let's move to Slide 13 to close with a discussion on our foreign currency strategy. As we outlined at the beginning of 2018, our foreign currency hedge percentages are back within the rolling 36-month targeted ranges established under our risk management framework. As a reminder, those hedge ranges are as follows: 70% to 100% hedged for the next 12 months; 30% to 70% for the second 12 months; and 0% to 30% hedged for the third 12 months. We remain fully hedged through 2019 and about 50% hedged for 2020 at hedge rates well above current market rates, which should support our earnings translation through the volatile periods surrounding Brexit. 
We continue to believe that there will be upside to the current rates as we move past the political uncertainty in the U.K. We will continue to be opportunistic in our hedging execution as we have done historically. 
You can see on the right side of the page that most bank forecast remain above the current forwards, especially for 2021. We continue to maintain our budgeted rate for open positions at $1.40 per GBP 1 for 2020. And as I mentioned earlier, we are using a range of $1.35 to $1.60 per GBP 1 for the low and high ranges of our 2021 guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Relative to the amount that we're collecting, it's about $180 million of revenue that we're collecting in pension deficit funding. Based on the current assumptions and as Vince noted, the lower asset returns and balances, we believe, are still going to require continued deficit funding certainly over the next several years. So just for sensitivity purposes, as we noted, we stressed it, another $0.05 in the low case. So the primary drivers to the high and low guidance range that we gave are the FX and the U.K. pension and other true-ups, which we discussed. Relative to the more detailed question, I'll turn that over to Vince."

So any true-up that would be required there would be trued up in the '23-'24 timeframe. So that just gives you a sense of how this process and how these adjustments will play out."

One is, and you kind of alluded to it, is inflation to the extent that inflation is driving the RPI or CPI in the U.K. upwards, which it has been. That's actually a positive because that creates incremental revenue for us. So -- and certainly, we've seen some benefit from that here lately. I think also incremental cost efficiency, we've done an excellent job both in the U.K. and in the domestic utilities to really try to take cost out wherever we can. And that's certainly an area that we're going to continue to look at. I think the other things are customer and load growth. I think you see that with our year-end 2018 on a weather-adjusted basis, we did see some uptick in load growth. I'm not sure that that's indicative of what we're going to see going forward, but built into our plan is actually slightly negative load growth. So certainly anything flat to positive will be upside to the current plan. And then, of course, regulatory outcomes could always, whether it be in Kentucky or Pennsylvania, could help lift earnings higher as well. So those are just some of the other ones that I would add. And potentially, incremental CapEx towards the back end of the plan. As Vince mentioned, our CapEx plan is really just based on kind of specific projects that we already know about and have high confidence that we can execute on. But I'm sure that there will be additional incremental CapEx as we look towards the back end of the plan."

And my next question goes to the attestations you're making with regard to your views on the trajectory of what the negotiation with Ofgem will look like on RIIO-ED2, differences between the way distribution will be -- might be treated versus the way it appears at least at the outset transmission and gas are being treated. When you look at where this sort of -- this 3% number that they're attesting to starting at in terms of ROE, how do you think about walking that up to what you think you'll really be, what the real earnings opportunity is going to look like? Because I think in prior conversations, you've talked about how that really masks an opportunity when you add everything up to get back to the types of returns on equity, they're kind of consistent with what we earn here in the U.S."
185508,600193011,1657172,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2019",2019-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Sure, sure. So starting from that base, number one would be probably an expectation that we're not going to be in a negative risk-free return environment by the time our ROE is actually set.

So starting from that base, number one would be probably an expectation that we're not going to be in a negative risk-free return environment by the time our ROE is actually set. So that would be probably point number one. Point number two would be the upside potential from incentive revenue that we've had a long history of doing very, very well at. The third element would probably be the shift from fast pot to slow pot, putting more of our revenue into the -- if you want to call it the fast pot, the operating and  maintenance kind of bucket and a little bit less than the CapEx for slow pot bucket. And I believe that was about 100 -- would have been about $140 million had we shifted at about 10% in the current RIIO-ED1 regulatory process. Other potential upsides, we are not -- we know that Ofgem is going to have a keen focus on how do they incentivize the electric distribution companies to meet some of the clean energy objectives, policy objectives in the U.K. And we believe that's going to result in some other opportunities, whether that be CapEx or otherwise. But also in our case, the one element that we do have that we mentioned earlier on the pension deficit funding that's about $180 million that could be converted from arguably less quality earnings to more higher quality earnings through additional CapEx that we could spend and still not raise customer rates. Because of that reduction coming off the pension deficit, we can replace it with something that's going to be, longer term, an earnings driver. So those are, I would say, the major drivers as we look to RIIO-ED2, which again doesn't start for us until April of 2023."

So I don't think you're necessarily going to see the same level of adjustment for the electric distribution companies as what's being contemplated for gas. We've -- in our conversations with Ofgem, and they've made it clear in the consultation that this does not apply to electric distribution, they've reaffirmed that to us in our direct conversations with them. And as Bill said, I think we all agree that there will be additional capital requirements going into electric distribution in RIIO-2 as compared to RIIO-1 to meet all of the electrification needs. And so again, our sense is that Ofgem will, ultimately, for the electric distribution companies, come out with their returns to incentivize that investment."

If we determine that, the solid sales growth that we're seeing in 2018 is not just a weather anomaly, and that actually continues going forward, that would provide some upside to that base number. Again, we talked about the additional capital investment. As we go through the plan, none of that is built into the low end of the range. So of course, we have O&M and inflation assumptions in there.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the Heads of our U.S. Utility Businesses; and Phil Swift, who was recently named Chief Executive of Western Power Distribution in the U.K. following the unfortunate passing of Robert Symons in November.
While we are deeply saddened by Robert's passing and he will be sorely missed, we are very fortunate to have Phil, who has a wealth of experience with over 25 years at WPD. I have great confidence in Phil's ability to lead our tremendous team there and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution established by Robert over the past 20 years. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of 2018 results and PPL's business outlook for 2019. I'll also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed financial review of 2018 and 2019 and the discussion on our earnings guidance for 2021. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. 2018 marked another successful year for PPL as we delivered on our strategy of best-in-sector operational performance, investing in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation, and engaging and developing our people. We closed the year with strong operational and financial results. As announced earlier today, we achieved the high end of our 2018 ongoing earnings forecast range or $2.40 per share. 
2018 was the ninth consecutive year that we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. It was the second straight year that we achieved the high end of our forecast. We're very proud of this track record of financial performance. It reflects our emphasis on execution and operational excellence across the regulated businesses, which included minimizing regulatory lag and achieving the allowed returns set by each regulatory jurisdiction, which we accomplished in 2018. This was paramount in delivering a 7% increase in ongoing earnings from 2017 results while also strengthening the balance sheet post-tax reform. 
Focused on maintaining a strong financial foundation, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward to mitigate tax reform impacts, strengthen future credit metrics and support our solid investment-grade credit rating. As for investing in a sustainable energy future, we successfully completed about $3.5 billion of infrastructure improvements in 2018.
In Pennsylvania, we installed approximately 1.2 million new meters, keeping us well on pace to conclude our advanced metering project in 2019. We also continued to strengthen our transmission system to improve grid security and resiliency.
In Kentucky, we continue to make progress on a multiyear project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants. We ramped up the investment in Smart Grid technology on our distribution and transmission systems to more quickly detect outages and restore power. And we put the finishing touches on the modernization project at our Ohio Falls hydroelectric facility, increasing the generating capacity from 80 to 100 megawatts. 
In the U.K., we have executed on our asset replacement and fault management plans. We continue to incorporate more automation on our networks and advance numerous low carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of distributed energy resources.
In addition to delivering strong financial results through our infrastructure investments, we continue to make progress in pursuit of our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance. Our utilities remained among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. These achievements represent the 46th and 47th J.D. Power awards earned by our domestic utilities. 
Meanwhile, our 4 U.K. distribution network operating companies remained the top 4 performers in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction for the regulatory year ended March of 2018. WPD also ranked best among U.K. operators in stakeholder engagement and addressing vulnerable customers, which are important areas for Ofgem, and they did this for the seventh straight year. 
At the same time, safety and reliability across our businesses remained strong in 2018. All 3 of our domestic utility companies were recognized as top quartile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. In addition and for the second straight year, PPL Electric posted its best year ever for safety. 
These achievements reflect the common purpose and desire across our businesses to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to improve performance each and every day. 
On the regulatory front, I'd like to highlight our efforts in Pennsylvania in establishing a means for alternative ratemaking for state utilities. We view this as a very important piece of legislation as it grants the ability to develop additional regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling and incentive-based rates. 
Also in 2018, we continue to invest in our employees, developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees. While we need to continuously focus attention in this area, I'm proud to report that PPL was recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best employers in 2018. Our Pennsylvania operations were also recognized as Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion and received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. 
Turning to our 2019 outlook on Slide 5. Today, we initiated formal 2019 earnings guidance of $2.30 a share to $2.50 a share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2018 actual to the 2019 forecast earnings later in his remarks.
Our projected 2019 results keep us firmly on track to achieve the 5% to 6% growth target for ongoing EPS through 2020, which we reaffirm today. We also initiated a projected earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share for 2021. 
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.65 per share. PPL has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1946. In addition, the company has increased its dividend 17x over the past 18 years. We remain committed to dividend growth as it is an important piece of our overall shareowner return proposition. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend in the context of our yield and payout ratio relative to peers. 
In terms of network investment for 2019, we plan to put another $3.3 billion into our utilities, which we will continue to support the efforts to improve the customer experience and resiliency of the grid. As reflected in our 2018 results, our investments are driving better operational performance. We expect this trend to continue as we make these additional investments. 
Finally, we will remain focused on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, our rate review, which takes a combined revenue increase of $172 million, continues to proceed as scheduled before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our rate requests are being made to support additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, stronger and more resilient, to replace aging natural gas lines and to support additional power plant performance and reliability improvements. All these investments are expected to further improve service to our customers. 
In the U.K., we continue to work with Ofgem to develop the rules that may be used to shape the framework for the next price control, which begins in 2023 for electric distribution utilities. 
Turning to Slide 6. We wanted to clarify and outline some observations about Ofgem's recent RIIO-2 consultation document that pertains to the electric transmission and gas subsectors. That consultation document, which was issued in December, does not apply to the electricity distribution network operators, including our U.K. company, Western Power Distribution or WPD. In addition, it does not impact WPD's current business plans that extend through March of 2023 or it does not impact WPD's operations. 
It is important to note that this is a consultation, and Ofgem is seeking comment from a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure the best outcome. The comment period on that consultation ends March 14, 2019, with the decision expected by Ofgem in May. In that consultation document, the proposed returns for gas and transmission were lower than we expected. They are based on current market conditions and other proposed methodologies on which Ofgem is seeking input and comments.
Also in that document, Ofgem proposes to index the cost of equity to risk-free rates, which are currently negative in the U.K. Given we are years away from settling our tariffs or setting them for the electric distribution sector and market rates are currently near record lows, we believe there is potential upside from current market conditions in terms of the cost of equity that we will be receiving in RIIO-ED2. We also expect that incentives will play a significant role in RIIO-2 based on the subsector consultation.
We recognize that this will be an area of key debate as it represents a significant opportunity in driving operational efficiency and returns. While it's not clear how incentives will be structured for electric distribution networks at this time, we expect that Ofgem will be more focused on differentiating returns and provide substantial opportunities for the top performers. 
WPD is well-positioned with its strong track record of superior customer service and reliability. Further, we see ample opportunity for continued RAV growth through RIIO-2 to support replacement of aging infrastructure and the investment demands of U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. PPL and WPD will continue to monitor Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process and provide input and engage with Ofgem to ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders. 
Lastly, even though the current consultation for transmission and gas does not apply to WPD, we would still encourage our investors and others to provide their feedback and views to Ofgem on this consultation. It is critically important that Ofgem hears from all stakeholders during the consultation. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"
185508,600193011,1659342,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2019",2019-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for add",1846,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for additional details on the fourth quarter results. 
Today, we announced 2018 reported earnings of $2.58 per share compared to $1.64 per share a year ago. 2018 reported earnings reflect net special item benefits of $0.18 per share, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 2017 reported results reflect net special item expenses of $0.61 per share, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 
Adjusting for these special items, 2018 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.40 per share compared to $2.25 per share a year ago. The solid execution of our business plan and benefits from weather during the year enabled us to achieve the high end of our ongoing earnings guidance range.  Looking at 2019, as Bill indicated, we announced formal guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
As you may recall, we accelerated the timing of some planned equity issuances into 2018 and 2019 as a result of U.S. tax reform to support our credit metrics and significant capital investment program. While this results in higher dilution in 2018 and 2019, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth through 2020 based on the 2018 original ongoing earnings guidance midpoint of $2.30 per share. In addition, we continue to project growth through 2021 and have initiated a guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, which I will discuss in detail in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a detailed review of 2018 financial results. Overall, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth at each of our operating companies, driven by our substantial investment and ability to earn our allowed returns. Excluding the $0.07 per share impact from dilution, 2018 financial results grew nearly 10% from 2017 results. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher adjusted gross margins, the higher foreign currency translation rate and higher pension income for the U.K. segment. The positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. A portion of the adjusted gross margin increase was driven by higher sales volumes due to weather, was about $0.11 per share, primarily at our domestic utilities. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.36 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins driven by the April 1, 2018 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017 of $0.13, and other primarily due to an increase in expected pension asset returns on higher asset balances. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and higher income taxes, primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes as a result of a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower federal tax rate resulting from U.S. tax reform.
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, a $0.13 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins of $0.15 per share, primarily resulting from results on additional transmission capital investments, higher distribution sales volumes, including $0.03 due to weather, and higher zonal peak load. Note that adjusted gross margins for both Pennsylvania and Kentucky reflect the impact of lower collected taxes and revenues, which is offset in taxes in driving the significant tax benefit reflected on the slide. Higher adjusted gross margins in Pennsylvania were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to asset additions and higher financing costs. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.59 per share in 2018, a $0.04 year-over-year increase from 2017 excluding the impact of dilution. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins of $0.16 per share, excluding the effect of tax reform that has offset taxes. The increase in gross margins was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather of $0.06, higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and returns on additional environment capital investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.
Turning to Corporate and Other, we experienced a $0.07 decrease, driven by higher taxes due to reduced tax benefits as a result of lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and higher financing costs. 
Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 10. We began with our strong 2018 results and adjust for the significant weather benefits experienced this past year, which results in 2018 weather normalized ongoing earnings of $2.32 per share. I'll use that as a base in explaining the year-over-year drivers for comparability purposes. From that base, we project earnings per share growth at each of our segments, excluding $0.13 of dilution as a result of settling the remaining 43 million shares of common stock under our forward equity sales agreements that we completed in May of 2018. You'll see on the slide that we detailed the $0.13 of dilution by segment. 
Looking at the operational drivers, excluding the dilution, in the U.K. segment, we expect to deliver higher earnings of $0.13 per share compared to 2018. This increase is expected to result from higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2019 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rate and other primarily due to pensions. This is partially offset by higher interest expense from incremental debt issuances and higher income taxes. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher earnings of $0.02 per share. Higher transmission margins and lower O&M expenses are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we are projecting a $0.04 increase in earnings per share. This is expected to be driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates, and return on additional environmental capital investments. This is partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher depreciation and higher interest expense due to planned debt issuances. 
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we initiated a guidance range for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. Our high-level underlying assumptions are reflected on this slide, which begin with our rate base and returns. Rate base continues to grow at a steady pace of 5% to 6%, given the substantial investment opportunities we have in each of the utilities.
In terms of ROEs, our terms have -- our teams have done an excellent job of maintaining strong returns at or near their allowed levels through cost management, utilization of favorable recovery mechanisms and achieving performance incentives. We are confident that we will continue to execute at that high level as we have demonstrated consistently. 
We've also updated our assumptions regarding U.K. pensions, interest under-recovery and various other true-up mechanisms under the U.K. regulatory framework. In total, we are projecting these adjustments to impact 2021 earnings in the range of negative $0.05 to negative $0.10 per share compared to 2020's estimated earnings. 
In terms of foreign currency for 2021, we are using a range of $1.35 on the low side and $1.60 on the high side. $1.35 represents forward rates in the low end of our bank forecast for 2021. $1.60 reflects the higher end of the bank forecast for '21 and the historical average for the GBP rate. I'll touch on our foreign currency hedging status in a few moments.
Overall, our sensitivity on a fully opened position remains at about $0.01 change in the currency rate equaling a $0.01 change in EPS. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our planned capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 are detailed on the slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $14.5 billion over the period. In the U.K., we are projecting over $5.5 billion of capital investment over the next 5 years. There have not been significant changes to our U.K. capital plans as those have already been accepted by Ofgem through the end of RIIO-ED1. As we think about future spending beyond the current price control period, the electric distribution sector will have significant opportunities to deploy incremental capital, given the U.K.'s electrification initiatives. 
Turning to Pennsylvania, we are projecting about $4.5 billion of investment over the next 5 years, with the majority of the investment in transmission as we continue our focus on grid resiliency and modernization. There are also no significant changes to report in our Pennsylvania capital plan, with a slight increase driven by additional reliability in other projects in providing our electric service to our customers. 
Finally, in Kentucky, we are projecting more than $4.5 billion of investment over that period. We made a few changes to the Kentucky capital plan in this update. First, we included some incremental infrastructure projects and some environmental spending related to compliance with effluent limitation guidelines. In total, this was about $425 million of incremental capital. However, we also updated the Kentucky capital plan to remove about $275 million for the advanced metering system project.
We continue to believe the AMS project will benefit our customers, and we expect to continue to seek approval from the KPSC for this project. Similar to prior years, we only include identified projects with a high probability of certainty in our capital plan. We will update our capital plan at the appropriate time per normal course, along with any additional capital spending opportunities across our utilities as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. 
Let's move to Slide 13 to close with a discussion on our foreign currency strategy. As we outlined at the beginning of 2018, our foreign currency hedge percentages are back within the rolling 36-month targeted ranges established under our risk management framework. As a reminder, those hedge ranges are as follows: 70% to 100% hedged for the next 12 months; 30% to 70% for the second 12 months; and 0% to 30% hedged for the third 12 months. We remain fully hedged through 2019 and about 50% hedged for 2020 at hedge rates well above current market rates, which should support our earnings translation through the volatile periods surrounding Brexit. 
We continue to believe that there will be upside to the current rates as we move past the political uncertainty in the U.K. We will continue to be opportunistic in our hedging execution as we have done historically. 
You can see on the right side of the page that most bank forecast remain above the current forwards, especially for 2021. We continue to maintain our budgeted rate for open positions at $1.40 per GBP 1 for 2020. And as I mentioned earlier, we are using a range of $1.35 to $1.60 per GBP 1 for the low and high ranges of our 2021 guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Relative to the amount that we're collecting, it's about $180 million of revenue that we're collecting in pension deficit funding. Based on the current assumptions and as Vince noted, the lower asset returns and balances, we believe, are still going to require continued deficit funding certainly over the next several years. So just for sensitivity purposes, as we noted, we stressed it, another $0.05 in the low case. So the primary drivers to the high and low guidance range that we gave are the FX and the U.K. pension and other true-ups, which we discussed. Relative to the more detailed question, I'll turn that over to Vince."

So any true-up that would be required there would be trued up in the '23-'24 timeframe. So that just gives you a sense of how this process and how these adjustments will play out."

I think also incremental cost efficiency, we've done an excellent job both in the U.K. and in the domestic utilities to really try to take cost out wherever we can. And that's certainly an area that we're going to continue to look at. I think the other things are customer and load growth. I think you see that with our year-end 2018 on a weather-adjusted basis, we did see some uptick in load growth. I'm not sure that that's indicative of what we're going to see going forward, but built into our plan is actually slightly negative load growth. So certainly anything flat to positive will be upside to the current plan. And then, of course, regulatory outcomes could always, whether it be in Kentucky or Pennsylvania, could help lift earnings higher as well. So those are just some of the other ones that I would add. And potentially, incremental CapEx towards the back end of the plan. As Vince mentioned, our CapEx plan is really just based on kind of specific projects that we already know about and have high confidence that we can execute on. But I'm sure that there will be additional incremental CapEx as we look towards the back end of the plan."

And my next question goes to the attestations you're making with regard to your views on the trajectory of what the negotiation with Ofgem will look like on RIIO-ED2, differences between the way distribution will be -- might be treated versus the way it appears at least at the outset transmission and gas are being treated. When you look at where this sort of -- this 3% number that they're attesting to starting at in terms of ROE, how do you think about walking that up to what you think you'll really be, what the real earnings opportunity is going to look like? Because I think in prior conversations, you've talked about how that really masks an opportunity when you add everything up to get back to the types of returns on equity, they're kind of consistent with what we earn here in the U.S."

So starting from that base, number one would be probably an expectation that we're not going to be in a negative risk-free return environment by the time our ROE is actually set. So that would be probably point number one. Point number two would be the upside potential from incentive revenue that we've had a long history of doing very, very well at. The third element would probably be the shift from fast pot to slow pot, putting more of our revenue into the -- if you want to call it the fast pot, the operating and  maintenance kind of bucket and a little bit less than the CapEx for slow pot bucket. And I believe that was about 100 -- would have been about $140 million had we shifted at about 10% in the current RIIO-ED1 regulatory process. Other potential upsides, we are not -- we know that Ofgem is going to have a keen focus on how do they incentivize the electric distribution companies to meet some of the clean energy objectives, policy objectives in the U.K. And we believe that's going to result in some other opportunities, whether that be CapEx or otherwise. But also in our case, the one element that we do have that we mentioned earlier on the pension deficit funding that's about $180 million that could be converted from arguably less quality earnings to more higher quality earnings through additional CapEx that we could spend and still not raise customer rates. Because of that reduction coming off the pension deficit, we can replace it with something that's going to be, longer term, an earnings driver. So those are, I would say, the major drivers as we look to RIIO-ED2, which again doesn't start for us until April of 2023."

So I don't think you're necessarily going to see the same level of adjustment for the electric distribution companies as what's being contemplated for gas. We've -- in our conversations with Ofgem, and they've made it clear in the consultation that this does not apply to electric distribution, they've reaffirmed that to us in our direct conversations with them. And as Bill said, I think we all agree that there will be additional capital requirements going into electric distribution in RIIO-2 as compared to RIIO-1 to meet all of the electrification needs. And so again, our sense is that Ofgem will, ultimately, for the electric distribution companies, come out with their returns to incentivize that investment."

If we determine that, the solid sales growth that we're seeing in 2018 is not just a weather anomaly, and that actually continues going forward, that would provide some upside to that base number. Again, we talked about the additional capital investment. As we go through the plan, none of that is built into the low end of the range. So of course, we have O&M and inflation assumptions in there.

While we are deeply saddened by Robert's passing and he will be sorely missed, we are very fortunate to have Phil, who has a wealth of experience with over 25 years at WPD. I have great confidence in Phil's ability to lead our tremendous team there and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution established by Robert over the past 20 years. 
Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of 2018 results and PPL's business outlook for 2019. I'll also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed financial review of 2018 and 2019 and the discussion on our earnings guidance for 2021. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. 2018 marked another successful year for PPL as we delivered on our strategy of best-in-sector operational performance, investing in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation, and engaging and developing our people. We closed the year with strong operational and financial results. As announced earlier today, we achieved the high end of our 2018 ongoing earnings forecast range or $2.40 per share. 
2018 was the ninth consecutive year that we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. It was the second straight year that we achieved the high end of our forecast. We're very proud of this track record of financial performance. It reflects our emphasis on execution and operational excellence across the regulated businesses, which included minimizing regulatory lag and achieving the allowed returns set by each regulatory jurisdiction, which we accomplished in 2018. This was paramount in delivering a 7% increase in ongoing earnings from 2017 results while also strengthening the balance sheet post-tax reform. 
Focused on maintaining a strong financial foundation, we completed a $1.7 billion equity forward to mitigate tax reform impacts, strengthen future credit metrics and support our solid investment-grade credit rating. As for investing in a sustainable energy future, we successfully completed about $3.5 billion of infrastructure improvements in 2018.
In Pennsylvania, we installed approximately 1.2 million new meters, keeping us well on pace to conclude our advanced metering project in 2019. We also continued to strengthen our transmission system to improve grid security and resiliency.
In Kentucky, we continue to make progress on a multiyear project to cap and close ash ponds at our coal-fired power plants. We ramped up the investment in Smart Grid technology on our distribution and transmission systems to more quickly detect outages and restore power. And we put the finishing touches on the modernization project at our Ohio Falls hydroelectric facility, increasing the generating capacity from 80 to 100 megawatts. 
In the U.K., we have executed on our asset replacement and fault management plans. We continue to incorporate more automation on our networks and advance numerous low carbon network projects to enable increased adoption of distributed energy resources.
In addition to delivering strong financial results through our infrastructure investments, we continue to make progress in pursuit of our strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance. Our utilities remained among the very best for customer satisfaction in the regions we serve. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. These achievements represent the 46th and 47th J.D. Power awards earned by our domestic utilities. 
Meanwhile, our 4 U.K. distribution network operating companies remained the top 4 performers in Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction for the regulatory year ended March of 2018. WPD also ranked best among U.K. operators in stakeholder engagement and addressing vulnerable customers, which are important areas for Ofgem, and they did this for the seventh straight year. 
At the same time, safety and reliability across our businesses remained strong in 2018. All 3 of our domestic utility companies were recognized as top quartile of public utilities nationwide in limiting the average number of outages per customer. In addition and for the second straight year, PPL Electric posted its best year ever for safety. 
These achievements reflect the common purpose and desire across our businesses to deliver without fail for our customers, to exceed their expectations and to improve performance each and every day. 
On the regulatory front, I'd like to highlight our efforts in Pennsylvania in establishing a means for alternative ratemaking for state utilities. We view this as a very important piece of legislation as it grants the ability to develop additional regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling and incentive-based rates. 
Also in 2018, we continue to invest in our employees, developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees. While we need to continuously focus attention in this area, I'm proud to report that PPL was recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best employers in 2018. Our Pennsylvania operations were also recognized as Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion and received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. 
Turning to our 2019 outlook on Slide 5. Today, we initiated formal 2019 earnings guidance of $2.30 a share to $2.50 a share. Vince will take you through a detailed walk of 2018 actual to the 2019 forecast earnings later in his remarks.
Our projected 2019 results keep us firmly on track to achieve the 5% to 6% growth target for ongoing EPS through 2020, which we reaffirm today. We also initiated a projected earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share for 2021. 
Turning to our dividend. Today, we announced we are raising the annualized dividend to $1.65 per share. PPL has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1946. In addition, the company has increased its dividend 17x over the past 18 years. We remain committed to dividend growth as it is an important piece of our overall shareowner return proposition. We will continue to assess the rate at which we grow the dividend in the context of our yield and payout ratio relative to peers. 
In terms of network investment for 2019, we plan to put another $3.3 billion into our utilities, which we will continue to support the efforts to improve the customer experience and resiliency of the grid. As reflected in our 2018 results, our investments are driving better operational performance. We expect this trend to continue as we make these additional investments. 
Finally, we will remain focused on achieving balanced regulatory outcomes that will benefit our customers and our shareowners. In Kentucky, our rate review, which takes a combined revenue increase of $172 million, continues to proceed as scheduled before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Our rate requests are being made to support additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, stronger and more resilient, to replace aging natural gas lines and to support additional power plant performance and reliability improvements. All these investments are expected to further improve service to our customers. 
In the U.K., we continue to work with Ofgem to develop the rules that may be used to shape the framework for the next price control, which begins in 2023 for electric distribution utilities. 
Turning to Slide 6. We wanted to clarify and outline some observations about Ofgem's recent RIIO-2 consultation document that pertains to the electric transmission and gas subsectors. That consultation document, which was issued in December, does not apply to the electricity distribution network operators, including our U.K. company, Western Power Distribution or WPD. In addition, it does not impact WPD's current business plans that extend through March of 2023 or it does not impact WPD's operations. 
It is important to note that this is a consultation, and Ofgem is seeking comment from a wide variety of stakeholders to ensure the best outcome. The comment period on that consultation ends March 14, 2019, with the decision expected by Ofgem in May. In that consultation document, the proposed returns for gas and transmission were lower than we expected. They are based on current market conditions and other proposed methodologies on which Ofgem is seeking input and comments.
Also in that document, Ofgem proposes to index the cost of equity to risk-free rates, which are currently negative in the U.K. Given we are years away from settling our tariffs or setting them for the electric distribution sector and market rates are currently near record lows, we believe there is potential upside from current market conditions in terms of the cost of equity that we will be receiving in RIIO-ED2. We also expect that incentives will play a significant role in RIIO-2 based on the subsector consultation.
We recognize that this will be an area of key debate as it represents a significant opportunity in driving operational efficiency and returns. While it's not clear how incentives will be structured for electric distribution networks at this time, we expect that Ofgem will be more focused on differentiating returns and provide substantial opportunities for the top performers. 
WPD is well-positioned with its strong track record of superior customer service and reliability. Further, we see ample opportunity for continued RAV growth through RIIO-2 to support replacement of aging infrastructure and the investment demands of U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. PPL and WPD will continue to monitor Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process and provide input and engage with Ofgem to ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders. 
Lastly, even though the current consultation for transmission and gas does not apply to WPD, we would still encourage our investors and others to provide their feedback and views to Ofgem on this consultation. It is critically important that Ofgem hears from all stakeholders during the consultation. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview. Vince?"
185508,600193011,1662166,"PPL Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2019",2019-02-14,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for add",1846,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 8 for a brief financial overview before I get into the details. Regarding 2018, I'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results. Please refer to the news release for additional details on the fourth quarter results. 
Today, we announced 2018 reported earnings of $2.58 per share compared to $1.64 per share a year ago. 2018 reported earnings reflect net special item benefits of $0.18 per share, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 2017 reported results reflect net special item expenses of $0.61 per share, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the unrealized foreign currency economic hedges. 
Adjusting for these special items, 2018 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.40 per share compared to $2.25 per share a year ago. The solid execution of our business plan and benefits from weather during the year enabled us to achieve the high end of our ongoing earnings guidance range.  Looking at 2019, as Bill indicated, we announced formal guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. 
As you may recall, we accelerated the timing of some planned equity issuances into 2018 and 2019 as a result of U.S. tax reform to support our credit metrics and significant capital investment program. While this results in higher dilution in 2018 and 2019, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth through 2020 based on the 2018 original ongoing earnings guidance midpoint of $2.30 per share. In addition, we continue to project growth through 2021 and have initiated a guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, which I will discuss in detail in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a detailed review of 2018 financial results. Overall, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth at each of our operating companies, driven by our substantial investment and ability to earn our allowed returns. Excluding the $0.07 per share impact from dilution, 2018 financial results grew nearly 10% from 2017 results. The primary drivers for the year-over-year increase are higher adjusted gross margins, the higher foreign currency translation rate and higher pension income for the U.K. segment. The positive drivers were partially offset by higher income taxes, higher O&M, higher depreciation and higher financing cost. A portion of the adjusted gross margin increase was driven by higher sales volumes due to weather, was about $0.11 per share, primarily at our domestic utilities. 
Turning to the individual segment drivers, starting with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.36 per share, a $0.12 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins driven by the April 1, 2018 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017 of $0.13, and other primarily due to an increase in expected pension asset returns on higher asset balances. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M and higher income taxes, primarily due to higher U.S. income taxes as a result of a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower federal tax rate resulting from U.S. tax reform.
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.62 per share, a $0.13 year-over-year increase excluding dilution. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins of $0.15 per share, primarily resulting from results on additional transmission capital investments, higher distribution sales volumes, including $0.03 due to weather, and higher zonal peak load. Note that adjusted gross margins for both Pennsylvania and Kentucky reflect the impact of lower collected taxes and revenues, which is offset in taxes in driving the significant tax benefit reflected on the slide. Higher adjusted gross margins in Pennsylvania were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to asset additions and higher financing costs. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.59 per share in 2018, a $0.04 year-over-year increase from 2017 excluding the impact of dilution. This increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins of $0.16 per share, excluding the effect of tax reform that has offset taxes. The increase in gross margins was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather of $0.06, higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and returns on additional environment capital investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense and higher depreciation expense due to asset additions.
Turning to Corporate and Other, we experienced a $0.07 decrease, driven by higher taxes due to reduced tax benefits as a result of lower tax shield on holding company interest expense and higher financing costs. 
Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 10. We began with our strong 2018 results and adjust for the significant weather benefits experienced this past year, which results in 2018 weather normalized ongoing earnings of $2.32 per share. I'll use that as a base in explaining the year-over-year drivers for comparability purposes. From that base, we project earnings per share growth at each of our segments, excluding $0.13 of dilution as a result of settling the remaining 43 million shares of common stock under our forward equity sales agreements that we completed in May of 2018. You'll see on the slide that we detailed the $0.13 of dilution by segment. 
Looking at the operational drivers, excluding the dilution, in the U.K. segment, we expect to deliver higher earnings of $0.13 per share compared to 2018. This increase is expected to result from higher gross margins, primarily driven by an April 1, 2019 price increase, higher foreign currency exchange rate and other primarily due to pensions. This is partially offset by higher interest expense from incremental debt issuances and higher income taxes. 
In Pennsylvania, we are projecting higher earnings of $0.02 per share. Higher transmission margins and lower O&M expenses are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation due to continued capital investment.
In Kentucky, we are projecting a $0.04 increase in earnings per share. This is expected to be driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates, and return on additional environmental capital investments. This is partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher depreciation and higher interest expense due to planned debt issuances. 
Turning to Slide 11. Today, we initiated a guidance range for 2021 of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. Our high-level underlying assumptions are reflected on this slide, which begin with our rate base and returns. Rate base continues to grow at a steady pace of 5% to 6%, given the substantial investment opportunities we have in each of the utilities.
In terms of ROEs, our terms have -- our teams have done an excellent job of maintaining strong returns at or near their allowed levels through cost management, utilization of favorable recovery mechanisms and achieving performance incentives. We are confident that we will continue to execute at that high level as we have demonstrated consistently. 
We've also updated our assumptions regarding U.K. pensions, interest under-recovery and various other true-up mechanisms under the U.K. regulatory framework. In total, we are projecting these adjustments to impact 2021 earnings in the range of negative $0.05 to negative $0.10 per share compared to 2020's estimated earnings. 
In terms of foreign currency for 2021, we are using a range of $1.35 on the low side and $1.60 on the high side. $1.35 represents forward rates in the low end of our bank forecast for 2021. $1.60 reflects the higher end of the bank forecast for '21 and the historical average for the GBP rate. I'll touch on our foreign currency hedging status in a few moments.
Overall, our sensitivity on a fully opened position remains at about $0.01 change in the currency rate equaling a $0.01 change in EPS. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our planned capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 are detailed on the slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $14.5 billion over the period. In the U.K., we are projecting over $5.5 billion of capital investment over the next 5 years. There have not been significant changes to our U.K. capital plans as those have already been accepted by Ofgem through the end of RIIO-ED1. As we think about future spending beyond the current price control period, the electric distribution sector will have significant opportunities to deploy incremental capital, given the U.K.'s electrification initiatives. 
Turning to Pennsylvania, we are projecting about $4.5 billion of investment over the next 5 years, with the majority of the investment in transmission as we continue our focus on grid resiliency and modernization. There are also no significant changes to report in our Pennsylvania capital plan, with a slight increase driven by additional reliability in other projects in providing our electric service to our customers. 
Finally, in Kentucky, we are projecting more than $4.5 billion of investment over that period. We made a few changes to the Kentucky capital plan in this update. First, we included some incremental infrastructure projects and some environmental spending related to compliance with effluent limitation guidelines. In total, this was about $425 million of incremental capital. However, we also updated the Kentucky capital plan to remove about $275 million for the advanced metering system project.
We continue to believe the AMS project will benefit our customers, and we expect to continue to seek approval from the KPSC for this project. Similar to prior years, we only include identified projects with a high probability of certainty in our capital plan. We will update our capital plan at the appropriate time per normal course, along with any additional capital spending opportunities across our utilities as we often identify projects during the execution of our plan. 
Let's move to Slide 13 to close with a discussion on our foreign currency strategy. As we outlined at the beginning of 2018, our foreign currency hedge percentages are back within the rolling 36-month targeted ranges established under our risk management framework. As a reminder, those hedge ranges are as follows: 70% to 100% hedged for the next 12 months; 30% to 70% for the second 12 months; and 0% to 30% hedged for the third 12 months. We remain fully hedged through 2019 and about 50% hedged for 2020 at hedge rates well above current market rates, which should support our earnings translation through the volatile periods surrounding Brexit. 
We continue to believe that there will be upside to the current rates as we move past the political uncertainty in the U.K. We will continue to be opportunistic in our hedging execution as we have done historically. 
You can see on the right side of the page that most bank forecast remain above the current forwards, especially for 2021. We continue to maintain our budgeted rate for open positions at $1.40 per GBP 1 for 2020. And as I mentioned earlier, we are using a range of $1.35 to $1.60 per GBP 1 for the low and high ranges of our 2021 guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Relative to the amount that we're collecting, it's about $180 million of revenue that we're collecting in pension deficit funding. Based on the current assumptions and as Vince noted, the lower asset returns and balances, we believe, are still going to require continued deficit funding certainly over the next several years. So just for sensitivity purposes, as we noted, we stressed it, another $0.05 in the low case. So the primary drivers to the high and low guidance range that we gave are the FX and the U.K. pension and other true-ups, which we discussed. Relative to the more detailed question, I'll turn that over to Vince."

So any true-up that would be required there would be trued up in the '23-'24 timeframe. So that just gives you a sense of how this process and how these adjustments will play out."

One is, and you kind of alluded to it, is inflation to the extent that inflation is driving the RPI or CPI in the U.K. upwards, which it has been.

I think also incremental cost efficiency, we've done an excellent job both in the U.K. and in the domestic utilities to really try to take cost out wherever we can. And that's certainly an area that we're going to continue to look at. I think the other things are customer and load growth. I think you see that with our year-end 2018 on a weather-adjusted basis, we did see some uptick in load growth. I'm not sure that that's indicative of what we're going to see going forward, but built into our plan is actually slightly negative load growth. So certainly anything flat to positive will be upside to the current plan. And then, of course, regulatory outcomes could always, whether it be in Kentucky or Pennsylvania, could help lift earnings higher as well. So those are just some of the other ones that I would add. And potentially, incremental CapEx towards the back end of the plan. As Vince mentioned, our CapEx plan is really just based on kind of specific projects that we already know about and have high confidence that we can execute on. But I'm sure that there will be additional incremental CapEx as we look towards the back end of the plan."

The third element would probably be the shift from fast pot to slow pot, putting more of our revenue into the -- if you want to call it the fast pot, the operating and  maintenance kind of bucket and a little bit less than the CapEx for slow pot bucket.

Other potential upsides, we are not -- we know that Ofgem is going to have a keen focus on how do they incentivize the electric distribution companies to meet some of the clean energy objectives, policy objectives in the U.K. And we believe that's going to result in some other opportunities, whether that be CapEx or otherwise. But also in our case, the one element that we do have that we mentioned earlier on the pension deficit funding that's about $180 million that could be converted from arguably less quality earnings to more higher quality earnings through additional CapEx that we could spend and still not raise customer rates. Because of that reduction coming off the pension deficit, we can replace it with something that's going to be, longer term, an earnings driver. So those are, I would say, the major drivers as we look to RIIO-ED2, which again doesn't start for us until April of 2023."

So I don't think you're necessarily going to see the same level of adjustment for the electric distribution companies as what's being contemplated for gas. We've -- in our conversations with Ofgem, and they've made it clear in the consultation that this does not apply to electric distribution, they've reaffirmed that to us in our direct conversations with them. And as Bill said, I think we all agree that there will be additional capital requirements going into electric distribution in RIIO-2 as compared to RIIO-1 to meet all of the electrification needs. And so again, our sense is that Ofgem will, ultimately, for the electric distribution companies, come out with their returns to incentivize that investment."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 first quarter results, and a very brief review of our operational and regulatory developments. Vince will then provide more detailed review of first quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. 
As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of [ $0.54 ] per share, in line with earnings from the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, the first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.70 per share compared with $0.74 per share a year ago. 
The decrease in ongoing earnings was driven primarily by share dilution and weather with lower earnings at PPL's U.S. segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K. 
Vince will provide a more detailed overview in his remarks.
PPL's performance in the first quarter keeps a solidly on-track to deliver on our 2019 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share to $2.50 per share. 
In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2019, as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. 
We remain confident in our ability to execute our business plans going forward. As a result, today, we reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual growth per share [ through ] 2020 measured against the midpoint of our regional 2018 earnings forecast. 
In addition, we reaffirmed our 2021 earnings forecast guidance of $2.550 to $2.80 oer share. 
Turning our focus to regulatory matters. Earlier this week, Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined revenue increase of $187 million for Kentucky Utilities and oil and gas electric, inclusive of elimination of $110 million [ bill ] credit associated with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. New rates [ stood ] effect on May 1. 
And its a decision, the commission rolled on open issues and approved the settlement among the parties, including a 9.725% return on equity. 
The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity as well as the natural gas service for our customers.
Also in Kentucky, we continue to advance a more sustainable generation fleet in the state with the retirement of an additional 300 megawatts of cold generation at the EW Brown facility in February. An initiated construction of the first 500 kilowatts section of the company's solar share program.
Shifting to the U.K. We continue to engage with Ofgem regarding the rules that may shape the framework for the next price control. That price control will begin in April of 2023 for electric distribution. 
In mid-March, PPL responded to Ofgem's RIIO-2 sectors specific methodology consultation for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electric transmission networks. 
While the current consultation does not apply to electricity distribution, and Ofgem has maintained that this consultation should not be read as applying to WPD or the other DNOs, we welcome the opportunity to express our views on a range of key issues that we see is critical for the overall RIIO-2 framework. 
We also welcome the opportunity to provide feedback that we've heard from our investors. In the appendix to today's presentation, we summarize a number of the key points made in our response letter.
Looking ahead to April of 2023 and beyond, we continue to believe that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among the electricity distribution network operators while providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performance, like WPD. 
In addition, we expect significant investment and growth opportunities for WPD over the next decade, as the DNOs work to support U.K. electrification and partner reduction initiatives. 
This expectation is supported by continued policy developments in the U.K. 
In March, for example, the U.K. government's Chief Financial Minister announced plans to introduce a new future home standard, which were headed stance PD systems in new homes beginning in 2025. 
This comes as the government looks to decarbonize heating. This move is expected to usher in a shift to energy efficient electric heat pumps. And like policy seeking and dramatic shift to electric vehicles in the U.K. by 2030, this policy is also expected to boost demand on our electricity networks. 
For our part, we continue to plan ahead for the [indiscernible] in other changes. 
In March, for example, our U.K. companies became the first DNOs to to launch an electric vehicle infrastructure strategy developed with a wide range of stakeholders, the strategy laid out targeted commitments for 2019 and 2020 as well as innovative projects that WPD will pursue to ensure ED charge income be accommodated efficiently and affordably on our local networks. 
Our plan projects that 217,000 ED charges will be connected to the -- our network by 2023. 
And we believe there's potential for even faster uptake that will be required to leave the U.K.'s 2040 deadline for banning sales of gasoline and diesel cars. 
This could translate into more than $3 million electric vehicles in WPD's service territory alone by [ 23rd ]. 
All of this is expected to create additional investment opportunities for WPD in RIIO-ED2 compared to RIIO-ED1. 
Turning to Slide 5. WPD continues to demonstrate the value of its strong operational performance for both our customers and our shareowners. 
All for the DNOs continue their premier service for the recently concluded 2018, 2019 regulatory period, and have once again earned robust incentive revenues in return.
WPD [ cheat ] over 80% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, which equated to approximately $110 million for the regulatory period, which is better than our historic performance and expectations. 
As we continue our focus on delivering best-in-sector operational results. 
WPD, as operating companies, also continues to improve on our already outstanding customer satisfaction performance, with each DNO earning a 9 out of 10 on customer satisfaction ratings. 
As you can see, the rest of the industry continues to elevate its performance as well under RIIO-ED1, with the peer average climbing to 8.8 from 8.7 a year ago. 
These results continue to highlight the overall value that the electricity distribution networks are providing to our customers. 
Moreover, WPD results demonstrate that RIIO-ED1 is working well and delivering value to customers as we deliver on your business plan outputs that we've developed through significant stakeholder engagement.
We believe this is evidence coupled with the significant investment opportunities from the U.K's. decarbonization initiatives, positions WPD for continued success. 
And we will continue to work with Ofgem to ensure our investors are appropriately compensated for providing the capital they needed to support such investments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.70 per share, which was in line with expectations and positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for the year. 
Looking at the year-over-year walk, PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.04 per share from Q1 2018 primarily driven by $0.03 [ of ] share dilution and less favorable weather this quarter compared to last year. 
Weather was about $0.02 negative compared to Q1 2018, and about a pending negative to budget for the quarter. Excluding dilution in weather, higher earnings in our U.K. segment were partially offset by lower earnings at our domestic businesses.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2019, and $0.08 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impacts of dilution in weather.
The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2018, increase partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
Higher -- other income, due to the higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 with Q1 2019 average rates of $1.34 per pound compared to $1.26 per pound in Q1 2018. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2019, or $0.03 decreased compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding dilution. 
This decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, primarily due to reduced income tax a s recovered in rates as a result of U.S. tax reform. This was $0.04, $0.02 in transmission, $0.02 in distribution, which is partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission. 
Higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to storm related cost and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PPL. 
Moving to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. 
This decrease was primarily due to higher operational and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
And finally, Corporate and other declined by $0.02 per share primarily due to higher income taxes and other.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 7. We maintained our hedging strategy consistent with our risk management program, and layered on additional hedges since our last update. 
For the balance of 2019, we are 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound. 
For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage sightly to 55% using options, which preserves the upside to the currency. The new average rate for 2020 reflecting these options is $1.47 per pound. 
We remain open in 2021 with the forward rates holding in the [ mid at ] $1.30 per pound range. 
We will continue to asses political and economic situation in the U.K. and the context of our hedging program, and we'll remain opportunistic in layering on additional hedges over time.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question and answer period."

Well, on a headroom question, obviously, part of that could be driven by the overall price of power, so to the extent of the commodity price on -- at the wholesale lever -- level drops, and we have seen natural gas prices fall, which in turn has driven power prices further down. And when that happens, that creates potential headroom for us. The other area is to the extent that we find cost savings on the operating and maintenance run. That will create some headroom that will allow us to put in more CapEx without potentially a significant increase in rates. 
Having said that, with our capital plan that exist today, it only reflects the projects that we've identified to date, and there are certainly opportunities that we could act on in the future. And some of those that aren't in the 5-year plan, for example, we see -- or could be further enhanced our -- some great results -- resiliency efforts both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. We have the automated meter project in Kentucky, potential renewable expansion, I would say, just in general. There's other general -- generation power-plant modification in Kentucky that are required by new environmental regulations. 
And for 2023 and beyond, we already talked about some of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. And as you know, our capital plans are essentially set already in the U.K. until the end of RIIO-ED2. So those are identified and known and not really subject to change per se."

So with it's mean testing, whether it's market mechanisms, I think that would be a better approach for all involved."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 first quarter results, and a brief review of our operational and regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.64 per share, in line with earnings from the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, the first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.70 per share compared with $0.74 per share a year ago. The decrease in ongoing earnings was driven primarily by share dilution and weather with lower earnings at PPL's U.S. segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K. 
Vince will provide a more detailed overview in his remarks.
PPL's performance in the first quarter keeps us solidly on-track to deliver on our 2019 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share to $2.50 per share. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2019, as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We remain confident in our ability to execute our business plans moving forward. As a result, today, we reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our regional 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we reaffirmed our 2021 earnings forecast guidance of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. 
Turning our focus to regulatory matters. Earlier this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized the combined revenue increase of $187 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, inclusive of elimination of $110 million bill credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. New rates took effect on May 1. 
And it's a decision the commission ruled on open issues and approved the settlement among the parties, including a 9.725% return on equity.  The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity as well as natural gas service for our customers.
Also in Kentucky, we continue to advance a more sustainable generation fleet in the state with the retirement of an additional 300 megawatts of cold generation at the E.W. Brown facility in February, and initiated construction of the first 500 kilowatts section of the company's solar share program.
Shifting to the U.K. We continue to engage with Ofgem regarding the rules that may shape the framework for the next rate control. That price control will begin in April of 2023 for electric distribution. In mid-March, PPL responded to Ofgem's RIIO-2 sector specific methodology consultation for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electric transmission networks. 
While the current consultation does not apply to electricity distribution, and Ofgem has maintained that this consultation should not be read as applying to WPD or the other DNOs, we welcome the opportunity to express our views on a range of key issues that we see as critical for the overall RIIO-2 framework. We also welcome the opportunity to provide feedback that we've heard from our investors. 
In the appendix to today's presentation, we summarized a number of the key points made in our response letter. Looking ahead to April of 2023 and beyond, we continue to believe that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among the electricity distribution network operators while providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD. 
In addition, we expect significant investment in growth opportunities for WPD over the next decade, as the DNOs work to support U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. This expectation is supported by continued policy developments in the U.K. In March, for example, the U.K. government's Chief Financial Minister announced plans to introduce a new future home standard, which prohibits gas heating systems in new homes beginning in 2025. This comes as the government looks to decarbonize heating. This move is expected to usher in a shift to energy efficient electric heat pumps. And like policy seeking a dramatic shift to electric vehicles in the U.K. by 2030, this policy is also expected to boost demand on our electricity networks. For our part, we continue to plan ahead for these and other changes. 
In March, for example, our U.K. companies became the first DNOs to launch an electric vehicle infrastructure strategy. Developed with a wide range of stakeholders, the strategy lays out targeted commitments for 2019 and 2020 as well as innovative projects that WPD will pursue to ensure EV-charging can be accommodated efficiently and affordably on our local networks. 
Our plan projects that 217,000 EV chargers will be connected to the -- our network by 2023. And we believe there is potential for an even faster uptake that will be required to meet the U.K.'s 2040 deadline for banning sales of gasoline and diesel cars.  This could translate into more than 3 million electric vehicles in WPD's service territory alone by 2030.  All of this is expected to create additional investment opportunities for WPD in RIIO-ED2 compared to RIIO-ED1. 
Turning to Slide 5. WPD continues to demonstrate the value of its strong operational performance for both our customers and our shareowners.  All 4 of the DNOs continued their premier service for the recently concluded 2018, 2019 regulatory period, and have once again earned robust incentive revenues in return.
WPD achieved over 80% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, which equated to approximately $110 million for the regulatory period, which is better than our historic performance and expectations, as we continue our focus on delivering best-in-sector operational results. 
WPD's operating companies also continue to improve on their already outstanding customer satisfaction performance, with each DNO earning a 9 out of 10 on customer satisfaction ratings. 
As you can see, the rest of the industry continues to elevate its performance as well under RIIO-ED1, with the peer average climbing to 8.8 from 8.7 a year ago. 
These results continue to highlight the overall value that the electricity distribution networks are providing to our customers.  Moreover, WPD's results demonstrate that RIIO-ED1 is working well and delivering value to customers as we deliver on the business plan outputs that were developed through significant stakeholder engagement.  We believe this evidence coupled with the significant investment opportunities from the U.K's. decarbonization initiatives positions WPD for continued success. 
And we will continue to work with Ofgem to ensure our investors are appropriately compensated for providing the capital needed to support such investments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

Let's move to Slide 6 for an overview of first quarter segment results. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.70 per share, which was in line with expectations and positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for the year. 
Looking at the year-over-year walk, PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.04 per share from Q1 2018 primarily driven by $0.03 of share dilution and less favorable weather this quarter compared to last year. Weather was about $0.02 negative compared to Q1 2018, and about a $0.01 negative to budget for the quarter. Excluding dilution in weather, higher earnings at our U.K. segment were partially offset by lower earnings at our domestic businesses.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2019, an $0.08 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impacts of dilution in weather. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2018, increase partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
Higher -- other income, due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 with Q1 2019 average rates of $1.34 per pound compared to $1.26 per pound in Q1 2018. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.03 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding dilution. This decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, primarily due to reduced income taxes recovered in rates as a result of U.S. tax reform. This was $0.04, $0.02 in transmission, $0.02 in distribution, which was partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission. 
Higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to storm related cost and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E.
Moving to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. This decrease was primarily due to higher operational and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
And finally, Corporate and Other declined by $0.02 per share primarily due to higher income taxes and other.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 7. We maintained our hedging strategy consistent with our risk management program and layered on additional hedges since our last update. 
For the balance of 2019, we are 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound.  For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage sightly to 55% using options, which preserves the upside to the currency. The new average rate for 2020 reflecting these options is $1.47 per pound. 
We remain open in 2021 with the forward rates holding in the mid $1.30 per pound range.  We will continue to asses the political and economic situation in the U.K. in the context of our hedging program, and we'll remain opportunistic in layering on additional hedges over time.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question and answer period."

Well, on the headroom question, obviously, part of that could be driven by the overall price of power, so to the extent that the commodity prices at the wholesale lever -- level drops, and we have seen natural gas prices fall, which in turn has driven power prices further down. And when that happens, that creates potential headroom for us. The other area is to the extent that we find cost savings on the operating and maintenance run. That can create some headroom that will allow us to put in more CapEx without potentially a significant increase in rates. 
Having said that, with our capital plan that exist today, it only reflects the projects that we've identified to date, and there are certainly opportunities that we could act on in the future. And some of those that aren't in the 5-year plan, for example, we see -- or could be further enhanced are some great resiliency efforts both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. We have the automated meter project in Kentucky, potential renewables expansion, I would say, just in general. There is other generation power-plant modifications in Kentucky that are required by new environmental regulations. 
And for 2023 and beyond, we already talked about some of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. And as you know, our capital plans are essentially set already in the U.K. until the end of RIIO-ED2. So those are identified and known and not really subject to change per se."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 first quarter results, and a brief review of our operational and regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.64 per share, in line with earnings from the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, the first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.70 per share compared with $0.74 per share a year ago. The decrease in ongoing earnings was driven primarily by share dilution and weather with lower earnings at PPL's U.S. segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K. 
Vince will provide a more detailed overview in his remarks.
PPL's performance in the first quarter keeps us solidly on track to deliver on our 2019 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share to $2.50 per share. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2019, as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We remain confident in our ability to execute our business plans moving forward. As a result, today, we reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we reaffirmed our 2021 earnings forecast guidance of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. 
Turning our focus to regulatory matters. Earlier this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized the combined revenue increase of $187 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, inclusive of elimination of $110 million bill credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. New rates took effect on May 1. 
In its decision the commission ruled on open issues and approved the settlement among the parties, including a 9.725% return on equity.  The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity as well as natural gas service for our customers.
Also in Kentucky, we continue to advance a more sustainable generation of fleet in the state with the retirement of an additional 300 megawatts of cold generation at the E.W. Brown facility in February, and initiated construction of the first 500 kilowatts section of the company's solar share program.
Shifting to the U.K. We continue to engage with Ofgem regarding the rules that may shape the framework for the next price control. That price control will begin in April of 2023 for electric distribution. In mid-March, PPL responded to Ofgem's RIIO-2 sector specific methodology consultation for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electric transmission networks. 
While the current consultation does not apply to electricity distribution, and Ofgem has maintained that this consultation should not be read as applying to WPD or the other DNOs, we welcome the opportunity to express our views on a range of key issues that we see as critical for the overall RIIO-2 framework. We also welcome the opportunity to provide feedback that we've heard from our investors. 
In the appendix to today's presentation, we summarized a number of the key points made in our response letter. Looking ahead to April of 2023 and beyond, we continue to believe that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among the electricity distribution network operators while providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD. 
In addition, we expect significant investment in growth opportunities for WPD over the next decade, as the DNOs work to support U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. This expectation is supported by continued policy developments in the U.K. In March, for example, the U.K. government's Chief Financial Minister announced plans to introduce a new future home standard, which prohibits gas heating systems in new homes beginning in 2025. This comes as the government looks to decarbonize heating. This move is expected to usher in a shift to energy efficient electric heat pumps. And like policy seeking a dramatic shift to electric vehicles in the U.K. by 2030, this policy is also expected to boost demand on our electricity networks. For our part, we continue to plan ahead for these and other changes. 
In March, for example, our U.K. companies became the first DNOs to launch an electric vehicle infrastructure strategy. Developed with a wide range of stakeholders, the strategy lays out targeted commitments for 2019 and 2020 as well as innovative projects that WPD will pursue to ensure EV-charging can be accommodated efficiently and affordably on our local networks. 
Our planned projects that 217,000 EV chargers will be connected to the -- our network by 2023. And we believe there is potential for an even faster uptake that will be required to meet the U.K.'s 2040 deadline for banning sales of gasoline and diesel cars.  This could translate into more than 3 million electric vehicles in WPD's service territory alone by 2030.  All of this is expected to create additional investment opportunities for WPD in RIIO-ED2 compared to RIIO-ED1. 
Turning to Slide 5. WPD continues to demonstrate the value of its strong operational performance for both our customers and our shareowners.  All 4 of the DNOs continued their premier service for the recently concluded 2018, 2019 regulatory period, and have once again earned robust incentive revenues in return.
WPD achieved over 80% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, which equates to approximately $110 million for the regulatory period, which is better than our historic performance and expectations, as we continue our focus on delivering best-in-sector operational results. 
WPD's operating companies also continue to improve on their already outstanding customer satisfaction performance, with each DNO earning a 9 out of 10 on customer satisfaction ratings. 
As you can see, the rest of the industry continues to elevate its performance as well under RIIO-ED1, with the peer average climbing to 8.8 from 8.7 a year ago. 
These results continue to highlight the overall value that the electricity distribution networks are providing to our customers.  Moreover, WPD's results demonstrate that RIIO-ED1 is working well and delivering value to customers as we deliver on the business plan outputs that were developed through significant stakeholder engagement.  We believe this evidence coupled with the significant investment opportunities from the U.K's. decarbonization initiatives positions WPD for continued success. 
And we will continue to work with Ofgem to ensure our investors are appropriately compensated for providing the capital needed to support such investments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

Let's move to Slide 6 for an overview of first quarter segment results. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter of 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.70 per share, which was in line with expectations and positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for the year. 
Looking at the year-over-year walk, PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.04 per share from Q1 of 2018 primarily driven by $0.03 of share dilution and less favorable weather this quarter compared to last year. Weather was about $0.02 negative compared to Q1 2018, and about a $0.01 negative to budget for the quarter. Excluding dilution in weather, higher earnings at our U.K. segment were partially offset by lower earnings at our domestic businesses.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2019, an $0.08 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impacts of dilution in weather. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2018, increase partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
Higher -- other income, due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 with Q1 2019 average rates of $1.34 per pound compared to $1.26 per pound in Q1 2018. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.03 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding dilution. This decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, primarily due to reduced income taxes recovered in rates as a result of U.S. tax reform. This was $0.04:  $0.02 in transmission, $0.02 in distribution, which was partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission. 
Higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to storm related costs and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E.
Moving to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. This decrease was primarily due to higher operational and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
And finally, Corporate and Other declined by $0.02 per share primarily due to higher income taxes and other.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 7. We maintained our hedging strategy consistent with our risk management program and layered on additional hedges since our last update. 
For the balance of 2019, we are 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound.  For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage sightly to 55% using options, which preserves the upside to the currency. The new average rate for 2020 reflecting these options is $1.47 per pound. 
We remain open in 2021 with the forward rates holding in the mid $1.30 per pound range.  We will continue to asses the political and economic situation in the U.K. in the context of our hedging program, and we'll remain opportunistic in layering on additional hedges over time.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question and answer period."

Well, on the headroom question, obviously, part of that could be driven by the overall price of power, so to the extent that the commodity prices at the wholesale lever -- level drops, and we have seen natural gas prices fall, which in turn has driven power prices further down. And when that happens, that creates potential headroom for us. The other area is to the extent that we find cost savings on the operating and maintenance run. That can create some headroom that will allow us to put in more CapEx without potentially a significant increase in rates. 
Having said that, with our capital plan that exists today, it only reflects the projects that we've identified to date, and there are certainly opportunities that we could act on in the future. And some of those that aren't in the 5-year plan, for example, we see -- or could be further enhanced are some great resiliency efforts both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. We have the automated meter project in Kentucky, potential renewables expansion, I would say, just in general. There is other generation power-plant modifications in Kentucky that are required by new environmental regulations. 
And for 2023 and beyond, we already talked about some of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. And as you know, our capital plans are essentially set already in the U.K. until the end of RIIO-ED2. So those are identified and known and not really subject to change per se."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 first quarter results, and a brief review of our operational and regulatory developments. Vince will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.64 per share, in line with earnings from the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, the first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.70 per share compared with $0.74 per share a year ago. The decrease in ongoing earnings was driven primarily by share dilution and weather with lower earnings at PPL's U.S. segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the U.K. 
Vince will provide a more detailed overview in his remarks.
PPL's performance in the first quarter keeps us solidly on track to deliver on our 2019 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share to $2.50 per share. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2019, as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We remain confident in our ability to execute our business plans moving forward. As a result, today, we reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we reaffirmed our 2021 earnings forecast guidance of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. 
Turning our focus to regulatory matters. Earlier this week, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized the combined revenue increase of $187 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, inclusive of elimination of $110 million bill credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. New rates took effect on May 1. 
In its decision the commission ruled on open issues and approved the settlement among the parties, including a 9.725% return on equity. The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity as well as natural gas service for our customers.
Also in Kentucky, we continue to advance a more sustainable generation of fleet in the state with the retirement of an additional 300 megawatts of cold generation at the E.W. Brown facility in February, and initiated construction of the first 500 kilowatts section of the company's solar share program.
Shifting to the U.K. We continue to engage with Ofgem regarding the rules that may shape the framework for the next price control. That price control will begin in April of 2023 for electric distribution. In mid-March, PPL responded to Ofgem's RIIO-2 sector specific methodology consultation for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electric transmission networks. 
While the current consultation does not apply to electricity distribution, and Ofgem has maintained that this consultation should not be read as applying to WPD or the other DNOs, we welcome the opportunity to express our views on a range of key issues that we see as critical for the overall RIIO-2 framework. We also welcome the opportunity to provide feedback that we've heard from our investors. 
In the appendix to today's presentation, we summarized a number of the key points made in our response letter. Looking ahead to April of 2023 and beyond, we continue to believe that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among the electricity distribution network operators while providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD. 
In addition, we expect significant investment in growth opportunities for WPD over the next decade, as the DNOs work to support U.K. electrification and carbon reduction initiatives. This expectation is supported by continued policy developments in the U.K. In March, for example, the U.K. government's Chief Financial Minister announced plans to introduce a new future home standard, which prohibits gas heating systems in new homes beginning in 2025. This comes as the government looks to decarbonize heating. This move is expected to usher in a shift to energy efficient electric heat pumps. And like policy seeking a dramatic shift to electric vehicles in the U.K. by 2030, this policy is also expected to boost demand on our electricity networks. For our part, we continue to plan ahead for these and other changes. 
In March, for example, our U.K. companies became the first DNOs to launch an electric vehicle infrastructure strategy. Developed with a wide range of stakeholders, the strategy lays out targeted commitments for 2019 and 2020 as well as innovative projects that WPD will pursue to ensure EV-charging can be accommodated efficiently and affordably on our local networks. 
Our planned projects that 217,000 EV chargers will be connected to the -- our network by 2023. And we believe there is potential for an even faster uptake that will be required to meet the U.K.'s 2040 deadline for banning sales of gasoline and diesel cars. This could translate into more than 3 million electric vehicles in WPD's service territory alone by 2030. All of this is expected to create additional investment opportunities for WPD in RIIO-ED2 compared to RIIO-ED1. 
Turning to Slide 5. WPD continues to demonstrate the value of its strong operational performance for both our customers and our shareowners. All 4 of the DNOs continued their premier service for the recently concluded 2018, 2019 regulatory period, and have once again earned robust incentive revenues in return.
WPD achieved over 80% of the potential maximum reward across all incentive categories, which equates to approximately $110 million for the regulatory period, which is better than our historic performance and expectations, as we continue our focus on delivering best-in-sector operational results. 
WPD's operating companies also continue to improve on their already outstanding customer satisfaction performance, with each DNO earning a 9 out of 10 on customer satisfaction ratings. 
As you can see, the rest of the industry continues to elevate its performance as well under RIIO-ED1, with the peer average climbing to 8.8 from 8.7 a year ago. 
These results continue to highlight the overall value that the electricity distribution networks are providing to our customers. Moreover, WPD's results demonstrate that RIIO-ED1 is working well and delivering value to customers as we deliver on the business plan outputs that were developed through significant stakeholder engagement. We believe this evidence coupled with the significant investment opportunities from the U.K's. decarbonization initiatives positions WPD for continued success. 
And we will continue to work with Ofgem to ensure our investors are appropriately compensated for providing the capital needed to support such investments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed financial overview."

Let's move to Slide 6 for an overview of first quarter segment results. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter of 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.70 per share, which was in line with expectations and positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for the year. 
Looking at the year-over-year walk, PPL's first quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.04 per share from Q1 of 2018 primarily driven by $0.03 of share dilution and less favorable weather this quarter compared to last year. Weather was about $0.02 negative compared to Q1 2018, and about a $0.01 negative to budget for the quarter. Excluding dilution in weather, higher earnings at our U.K. segment were partially offset by lower earnings at our domestic businesses.
Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2019, an $0.08 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impacts of dilution in weather. The increase in U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2018, increase partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
Higher -- other income, due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 with Q1 2019 average rates of $1.34 per pound compared to $1.26 per pound in Q1 2018. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.03 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding dilution. This decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, primarily due to reduced income taxes recovered in rates as a result of U.S. tax reform. This was $0.04: $0.02 in transmission, $0.02 in distribution, which was partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission. 
Higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to storm related costs and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E.
Moving to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2019, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. This decrease was primarily due to higher operational and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
And finally, Corporate and Other declined by $0.02 per share primarily due to higher income taxes and other.
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me just provide a quick update on our foreign currency hedging status on Slide 7. We maintained our hedging strategy consistent with our risk management program and layered on additional hedges since our last update. 
For the balance of 2019, we are 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage slightly to 55% using options, which preserves the upside to the currency. The new average rate for 2020 reflecting these options is $1.47 per pound. 
We remain open in 2021 with the forward rates holding in the mid $1.30 per pound range. We will continue to assess the political and economic situation in the U.K. in the context of our hedging program, and we'll remain opportunistic in layering on additional hedges over time.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question and answer period."

Well, on the headroom question, obviously, part of that could be driven by the overall price of power, so to the extent that the commodity prices at the wholesale lever -- level drops, and we have seen natural gas prices fall, which in turn has driven power prices further down. And when that happens, that creates potential headroom for us. The other area is to the extent that we find cost savings on the operating and maintenance run. That can create some headroom that will allow us to put in more CapEx without potentially a significant increase in rates. 
Having said that, with our capital plan that exists today, it only reflects the projects that we've identified to date, and there are certainly opportunities that we could act on in the future. And some of those that aren't in the 5-year plan, for example, we see -- or could be further enhanced are some great resiliency efforts both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. We have the automated meter project in Kentucky, potential renewables expansion, I would say, just in general. There is other generation power-plant modifications in Kentucky that are required by new environmental regulations. 
And for 2023 and beyond, we already talked about some of the electrification initiatives in the U.K. And as you know, our capital plans are essentially set already in the U.K. until the end of RIIO-ED2. So those are identified and known and not really subject to change per se."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 second quarter results, and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide more detailed review of second quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.60 per share, resulting in a total of $1.24 per share through the first half of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.55 per share a year ago. On a year-to-date basis through June total ongoing earnings were $1.27 per share compared with $1.29 per share a year ago, which is in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through June, we remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share with a midpoint of $2.40. 
In addition, we remained on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019 as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. 
Looking beyond 2019, today we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continued to monitor foreign currency exchange rates for potential impacts on our earnings projections, which Joe will discuss in his update. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to deliver excellent service across all of our distribution networks. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction in July, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. This year mark the eighth and fourth straight years respectively that PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities have earned this distinction. All total PPL's utilities have received 49 J.D. Power awards in the 2 decades since the organization has steady customer satisfaction with electric utilities. In U.K., WPD was also recognized recently by Ofgem as the top-ranked network for the stakeholder engagement and consumer vulnerability incentive and achievement measured against all gas and electricity networks in the U.K. This is the eighth consecutive that WPD led the industry in this category. 
PPL track record of customer service excellence is a testament to the outstanding teams we have throughout our business and it reflects our strategic focus on delivering best-in-sector operational performance. In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities was also named the 2019 power players investor-owned utility of the year by the smart electric power lines during the second quarter. The award recognized PPL electrics work to create a smart grid distribution management system that's supports a greater adoption of distributed energy resources on the grid. This includes behind the major resources such as private solar and energy storage. Utilities the new distributed energy resources management system is just one of the many ways PPL companies are working to advance a cleaner energy future. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was named one of the most trusted utility brands in the country by a recent study conducted by as client, an human behavior and analytics firm. In this survey, PPL electric utilities are the top spot among the local study only utilities in the eastern United States. This recognition is yet another example of PPL elected commitment to top-tier reliability and service to its customers. 
Last but not least, little just elected recently received the American gas Association accident prevention award for safety excellence. Among it's peers, LG&E finished 2018 with the lowest rate of incidents resulting in lost time or restricted time at that time at work. We are proud of LG&E accomplishments, and we remain committed across our U.S. and U.K. operations to continue a safety improvement. Turning to a brief regulatory update uptick in the U.K., Ofgem and Lake make confirmed its RIIO-2 price to elegy for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission subsectors. While the announced methodology does not apply to the electricity distribution sector, which Ofgem has continually emphasized, we welcome the opportunity to share our views on some key issues. Broadly, we believe this update was a step in the right direction and look forward to our ongoing engagement with Ofgem as we plan our next price control. Our process that kicked off formally this morning with the open letter consultation. The letter was generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent conversations with Ofgem. Vince and I [indiscernible] the U.K. last week and held another series of productive meetings with members of Ofgem senior leadership team, including Chairman Martin Cape. We discussed the successes of RIIO-ED1 regulation progression and how there's been real value delivered to customers in the first 4 years of the price control. We also highlighted some of the areas for improvement and how Ofgem can achieve their objective of continuing to drive efficiencies, while preparing the network for the future. Overall, we're in agreement that the distribution networks are critical to the ongoing development of the UK's energy infrastructure, specifically to achieve the electrification and decarbonization initiatives. 
Network development has become even more important as the U.K. recently announced its commitment to achieving net 0 carbon emissions by the year 2050. This commitment further enhances the opportunities for DNOs, like WPD, to continue their leading roles in building the electricity grid of the future and connecting significant levels of renewable energy sources. We expect that Ofgem will provide the framework necessary for electricity distribution companies to support these objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so as they have done historically. 
Our recent dialogue supports our belief that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among the electricity DNOs and still provide substantial opportunities for outstanding performers, like WPD, during the next price control period. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the second quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered second quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.58 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to the second quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong second -- our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution and $0.05 weather-related verses compared to the prior period. $0.04 of the weather variance was related to strong volumes experienced in the second quarter of 2018 and weather was about [indiscernible] unfavorable compared to our forecast for the second quarter of 2019. Excluding dilution and weather with the higher earnings ASAP utility segment this quarter. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.36 per share, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution in the weather. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2019, price increase partially offset by lower sales volume, higher other income due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 for the second quarter 2019 average rate and $1.36 per pound compared to $1.33 in the second quarter of 2018. moving to Pennsylvania. our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding weather. The increase was probably due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and the timing impacts related to U.S. tax reform in 2018 and lower operation and maintenance expense primarily due to lower support cost. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky regulated segments earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. The increase was primarily due to higher base rates effective May 1, 2019 and lower income taxes due to estate tax credit. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates. An Higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. And finally, Corporate and Other remained flat over the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, solid second quarter performance positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. We provided a similar walk of the year-to-date results in the Appendix for your reference. Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. 
For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage to 63% compared to 55% on our first quarter call. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.46 per pound just slightly lower than the previous average of $1.47. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upsides to the current market rates that develop 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option base. We remain open in 2021, and as Bill mentioned recognized recent weakness in the exchange rates and continue to monitor potential impacts to our earnings projections. However, independent forecast of future exchange rates remain within the range of assumptions used for our 2021 projections. So near term fluctuations in the current year is expected given the current political environment the majority of the unless electric coverage currency following a resolution. And finally, we have flexibility in our hedging program that is not the quarter additional hedges at this time and allows us to take an opportunistic approach to hedging as we monitor the dynamics of the political situation and move towards Brexit decline in October. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for a question-and-answer period."

And our strong financial performance keeps us solidly on our track to achieve our 2019 earnings forecast. These operational successes are underpinned by an exceptional workplace that cultivates an inclusive and diverse workforce. I'd like to briefly highlight a couple recent honors recognizing these efforts that exemplify the constructive culture and lifeblood of our company. In june, or Kentucky operations were rewarded the highest U.S. government on to employees providing exceptional support of National Guard and reserve employees. The employer support of the Guard and support are ESG our freedom award. We want to 50 recipients for this prestigious award selected by the Department of Defense out of nearly 2,500 nominations this year.

And also customer satisfaction, which is that the highest level it's ever been. So we have a great story to tell and another data point is, which is on a positive side and that is that the Labour Party has really continued to lose momentum politically and as you know there were one of the -- one of the only political party that had proposed bringing some of the networks back under state control as well as rail and mail and so forth and more. So we think that the risk, while it was already very low is even lower than it previously was as the Labour Party has really failed to gain any momentum politically and certainly there is a -- always a probabilty that they could regain some of their funding but in our view very unlikely. So the other thing that we've been doing is we have a political consulting firm that we use in the U.K. It's been very helpful for us to reach out to some of the other stakeholders outside the parliament to again, educate and inform local community and leaders and so forth. So I think we're doing what we can to combat some of the broader political forces that play. But it is rather challenging."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 second quarter results, and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide more detailed review of second quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.60 per share, resulting in a total of $1.24 per share through the first half of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.55 per share a year ago. On a year-to-date basis through June total ongoing earnings were $1.27 per share compared with $1.29 per share a year ago, which is in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through June, we remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share with a midpoint of $2.40. 
In addition, we remained on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019 as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. 
Looking beyond 2019, today we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continued to monitor foreign currency exchange rates for potential impacts on our earnings projections, which Joe will discuss in his update. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to deliver excellent service across all of our distribution networks. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction in July, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. This year mark the eighth and fourth straight years respectively that PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities have earned this distinction. All-to-all PPL's utilities have received 49 J.D. Power awards in the 2 decades since the organization has steady customer satisfaction with electric utilities. In U.K., WPD was also recognized recently by Ofgem as the top-ranked network for the stakeholder engagement and consumer vulnerability incentive and achievement measured against all gas and electricity networks in the U.K. This is the eighth consecutive year that WPD led the industry in this category. 
PPL's track record of customer service excellence is a testament to the outstanding teams we have throughout our business and it reflects our strategic focus on delivering best-in-sector operational performance. In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities was also named the 2019 power players investor-owned utility of the year by the Smart Electric Power Alliance during the second quarter. The award recognized PPL Electrics work to create a smart grid distribution management system that's supports greater adoption of distributed energy resources on the grid. This includes behind-the-meter resources such as private solar and energy storage. The Utilities new distributed energy resources management system is just one of the many ways PPL companies are working to advance a cleaner energy future. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was named one of the most trusted utility brands in the country by a recent study conducted by Escalent, a human behavior and analytics firm. In this survey, PPL Electric Utilities earned the top spot among the electricity-only utilities in the eastern United States. This recognition is yet another example of PPL Electrics commitment to top-tier reliability and service to its customers. 
Last but not least, Louisville Gas and Electric recently received the American Gas Association's accident prevention award for safety excellence. Among its peers, LG&E finished 2018 with the lowest rate of incidents resulting in lost time or restricted time at work. We are proud of LG&E's accomplishment, and we remain committed across our U.S. and U.K. operations to continue a safety improvement. Turning to a brief regulatory update in the U.K., Ofgem in late May confirmed its RIIO-2 price control methodology for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission subsectors. While the announced methodology does not apply to the electricity distribution sector, which Ofgem has continually emphasized, we welcome the opportunity to share our views on some key issues. Broadly, we believe this update was a step in the right direction and look forward to our ongoing engagement with Ofgem as we plan our next price control. Our process that kicked off formally this morning with the open letter consultation. The letter was generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent conversations with Ofgem. Vince and I, were in the U.K. last week and held another series of productive meetings with members of Ofgem senior leadership team, including Chairman Martin Cave. We discussed the successes of RIIO-ED1 regulation and how there has been real value delivered to customers in the first 4 years of the price control. We also highlighted some of the areas for improvement and how Ofgem can achieve their objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Overall, we're in agreement that the distribution networks are critical to the ongoing development of the UK's energy infrastructure, specifically to achieve the electrification and decarbonization initiatives. 
Network development has become even more important as the U.K. recently announced its commitment to achieving net 0 carbon emissions by the year 2050. This commitment further enhances the opportunities for DNOs, like WPD, to continue their leading roles in building the electricity grid of the future and connecting significant levels of renewable energy sources. We expect that Ofgem will provide the framework necessary for electricity distribution companies to support these objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so as they have done historically. 
Our recent dialogue supports our belief that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs and still provide substantial opportunities for outstanding performers, like WPD, during the next price control period. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the second quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered second quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.58 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to the second quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong second -- our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution and $0.05 of weather-related variances compared to the prior period. $0.04 of the weather variance was related to strong volumes experienced in the second quarter of 2018 and weather was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to our forecast for the second quarter of 2019. Excluding dilution and weather, we saw higher earnings in each of our utility segments this quarter. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.36 per share, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2019, price increase partially offset by lower sales volume, higher other income due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 for the second quarter 2019 average rate of a $1.36 per pound compared to $1.33 in the second quarter of 2018. Moving to Pennsylvania. our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and the timing impact related to U.S. tax reform in 2018 and lower operation and maintenance expense primarily due to lower support cost. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. The increase was primarily due to higher base rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower income taxes due to a state tax credit. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates, and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. And finally, Corporate and Other remained flat over the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, our solid second quarter performance positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. We provided a similar walk of the year-to-date results in the appendix for your reference. Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. 
For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage to 63% compared to 55% on our first quarter call. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.46 per pound just slightly lower than the previous average of $1.47. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates to develop 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. We remain open in 2021, and as Bill mentioned we recognized the recent weakness in the exchange rates and continue to monitor potential impacts to our earnings projections. However, independent forecast of future exchange rates remain within the range of presumptions used for our 2021 projections. So near term fluctuations in the current year is expected given the current political environment, the majority of analyst trajectory we cover in the currency rates falling at Brexit resolution. And finally, we have flexibility in our hedging program that does not require to add additional hedges at this time and allows us to take an opportunistic approach to hedging as we monitor the dynamics of the political situation and move towards the Brexit deadline in October. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

And our strong financial performance keeps us solidly on track to achieve our 2019 earnings forecast. These operational successes are underpinned by an exceptional workplace that cultivates an inclusive and diverse workforce. I'd like to briefly highlight a couple recent honors recognizing these efforts that exemplify the constructive culture and lifeblood of our company. In June, our Kentucky operations were rewarded the highest U.S. government honor to employers for providing exceptional support of National Guard and Reserve employees. The employer support of the Guard and Reserve are ESGR Freedom Award. We were one of 15 recipients of this prestigious award selected by the Department of Defense out of nearly 2,500 nominations this year. And just last month, PPL was named a Best Place to Work for people with disabilities for the second straight year, earning a top score of 100% on the disability equality index for its commitment to creating and accommodating an exclusive environment for people with disabilities. At PPL, we want all individuals to reach their fullest potential and believe that our employees, colleagues and friends in the community of all abilities help us grow and thrive. We're extremely honored and proud of these achievements, and we will continue to advance in these efforts for an inclusive and powering environment for all employees to drive energy forward.

It is a challenging political and regulatory backdrop at the moment but there are some efforts that we have -- had underway in the U.K. to -- as basically educate many of those Ministers of Parliament that may not be familiar with specifically with the electricity networks, grid track record and that track record includes much lower cost than when the systems were nationalized, better reliability, much better reliability to the tune of about 60% better reliability than when they were under state control. And also customer satisfaction, which is at the highest level it's ever been. So we have a great story to tell and another data point is, which is on a positive side is that the Labour Party has really continued to lose momentum politically and as you know they were one of the -- one of the only political party that had proposed bringing some of the networks back under state control as well as rail and mail and so forth and more. So we think that the risk, while it was already very low is even lower than it previously was as the Labour Party has really failed to gain any momentum politically and certainly there is a -- always a probabilty that they could regain some of their footing but in our view very unlikely. So the other thing that we've been doing is we have a political consulting firm that we use in the U.K. It's been very helpful for us to reach out to some of the other stakeholders outside the parliament to again, educate and inform local community and leaders and so forth. So I think we're doing what we can to combat some of the broader political forces at play. But it is rather challenging."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 second quarter results, and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide more detailed review of second quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.60 per share, resulting in a total of $1.24 per share through the first half of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.55 per share a year ago. On a year-to-date basis through June total ongoing earnings were $1.27 per share compared with $1.29 per share a year ago, which is in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through June, we remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share with a midpoint of $2.40. 
In addition, we remained on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019 as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. 
Looking beyond 2019, today we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continued to monitor foreign currency exchange rates for potential impacts on our earnings projections, which Joe will discuss in his update. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to deliver excellent service across all of our distribution networks. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction in July, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. This year mark the eighth and fourth straight years respectively that PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities have earned this distinction. All told, PPL's utilities have received 49 J.D. Power awards in the 2 decades since the organization has steady customer satisfaction with electric utilities. In U.K., WPD was also recognized recently by Ofgem as the top-ranked network for the stakeholder engagement and consumer vulnerability incentive and achievement measured against all gas and electricity networks in the U.K. This is the eighth consecutive year that WPD led the industry in this category. 
PPL's track record of customer service excellence is a testament to the outstanding teams we have throughout our business and it reflects our strategic focus on delivering best-in-sector operational performance. In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities was also named the 2019 power players investor-owned utility of the year by the Smart Electric Power Alliance during the second quarter. The award recognized PPL Electrics work to create a smart grid distribution management system that supports greater adoption of distributed energy resources on the grid. This includes behind-the-meter resources such as private solar and energy storage. The Utilities new distributed energy resources management system is just one of the many ways PPL companies are working to advance a cleaner energy future. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was named one of the most trusted utility brands in the country by a recent study conducted by Escalent, a human behavior and analytics firm. In this survey, PPL Electric Utilities earned the top spot among the electricity-only utilities in the eastern United States. This recognition is yet another example of PPL Electrics commitment to top-tier reliability and service to its customers. 
Last but not least, Louisville Gas and Electric recently received the American Gas Association's accident prevention award for safety excellence. Among its peers, LG&E finished 2018 with the lowest rate of incidents resulting in lost time or restricted time at work. We are proud of LG&E's accomplishment, and we remain committed across our U.S. and U.K. operations to continue a safety improvement. Turning to a brief regulatory update in the U.K., Ofgem in late May confirmed its RIIO-2 price control methodology for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission subsectors. While the announced methodology does not apply to the electricity distribution sector, which Ofgem has continually emphasized, we welcome the opportunity to share our views on some key issues. Broadly, we believe this update was a step in the right direction and look forward to our ongoing engagement with Ofgem as we plan our next price control. Our process that kicked off formally this morning with the open letter consultation. The letter was generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent conversations with Ofgem. Vince and I, were in the U.K. last week and held another series of productive meetings with members of Ofgem senior leadership team, including Chairman Martin Cave. We discussed the successes of RIIO-ED1 regulation and how there has been real value delivered to customers in the first 4 years of the price control. We also highlighted some of the areas for improvement and how Ofgem can achieve their objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Overall, we're in agreement that the distribution networks are critical to the ongoing development of the U.K.'s energy infrastructure, specifically to achieve the electrification and decarbonization initiatives. 
Network development has become even more important as the U.K. recently announced its commitment to achieving net 0 carbon emissions by the year 2050. This commitment further enhances the opportunities for DNOs, like WPD, to continue their leading roles in building the electricity grid of the future and connecting significant levels of renewable energy sources. We expect that Ofgem will provide the framework necessary for electricity distribution companies to support these objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so as they have done historically. 
Our recent dialogue supports our belief that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs and still provide substantial opportunities for outstanding performers, like WPD, during the next price control period. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the second quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered second quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.58 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to the second quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong second -- our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution and $0.05 of weather-related variances compared to the prior period. $0.04 of the weather variance was related to strong volumes experienced in the second quarter of 2018 and weather was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to our forecast for the second quarter of 2019. Excluding dilution and weather, we saw higher earnings in each of our utility segments this quarter. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.36 per share, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2019, price increase partially offset by lower sales volume, higher other income due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 for the second quarter 2019 average rate of a $1.36 per pound compared to $1.33 in the second quarter of 2018. Moving to Pennsylvania. our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and the timing impact related to U.S. tax reform in 2018 and lower operation and maintenance expense primarily due to lower support cost. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. The increase was primarily due to higher base rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower income taxes due to a state tax credit. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates, and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. And finally, Corporate and Other remained flat over the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, our solid second quarter performance positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. We provided a similar walk of the year-to-date results in the appendix for your reference. Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. 
For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage to 63% compared to 55% on our first quarter call. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.46 per pound just slightly lower than the previous average of $1.47. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates to develop 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. We remain open in 2021, and as Bill mentioned we recognized the recent weakness in the exchange rates and continue to monitor potential impacts to our earnings projections. However, independent forecast of future exchange rates remain within the range of presumptions used for our 2021 projections. While near term fluctuations in the currency is expected given the current political environment, the majority of analysts project a recovery in the currency rates following a Brexit resolution. And finally, we have flexibility in our hedging program that does not require us to add additional hedges at this time and allows us to take an opportunistic approach to hedging as we monitor the dynamics of the political situation and move towards the Brexit deadline in October. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

In closing, all of our PPL companies continue to execute at an extremely high level as evidenced once again by the accolades earned from our customers and industry groups. We remained focused on delivering on our low-risk business plan to build tomorrow's infrastructure and advance a sustainable energy future. And our strong financial performance keeps us solidly on track to achieve our 2019 earnings forecast. These operational successes are underpinned by an exceptional workplace that cultivates an inclusive and diverse workforce. I'd like to briefly highlight a couple recent honors recognizing these efforts that exemplify the constructive culture and lifeblood of our company. In June, our Kentucky operations were rewarded the highest U.S. government honor to employers for providing exceptional support of National Guard and Reserve employees. The employer support of the Guard and Reserve earned an ESGR Freedom Award. We were one of 15 recipients of this prestigious award selected by the Department of Defense out of nearly 2,500 nominations this year. And just last month, PPL was named a Best Place to Work for people with disabilities for the second straight year, earning a top score of 100% on the disability equality index for its commitment to creating and accommodating an inclusive environment for people with disabilities. At PPL, we want all individuals to reach their fullest potential and believe that our employees, colleagues and friends in the community of all abilities help us grow and thrive. We're extremely honored and proud of these achievements, and we will continue to advance in these efforts for an inclusive, empowering environment for all employees to drive energy forward.

That we would project to see when they do the sector methodology consultation, which would kick off mid-next year.

And that track record includes much lower cost than when the systems were nationalized, better reliability, much better reliability to the tune of about 60% better reliability than when they were under state control. And also customer satisfaction, which is at the highest level it's ever been. So we have a great story to tell and another data point is, which is on a positive side is that the Labour Party has really continued to lose momentum politically and as you know they were one of the -- one of the only political party that had proposed bringing some of the networks back under state control as well as rail and mail and so forth. And water. So we think that the risk, while it was already very low is even lower than it previously was as the Labour Party has really failed to gain any momentum politically and certainly there is a -- always a probabilty that they could regain some of their footing but in our view very unlikely. So the other thing that we've been doing is we have a political consulting firm that we use in the U.K. It's been very helpful for us to reach out to some of the other stakeholders outside the parliament to again, educate and inform local community and leaders and so forth. So I think we're doing what we can to combat some of the broader political forces at play. But it is rather challenging."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 second quarter results, and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide more detailed review of second quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.60 per share, resulting in a total of $1.24 per share through the first half of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.55 per share a year ago. On a year-to-date basis through June total ongoing earnings were $1.27 per share compared with $1.29 per share a year ago, which is in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through June, we remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share with a midpoint of $2.40. 
In addition, we remained on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019 as we work to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. 
Looking beyond 2019, today we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share through 2020 measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continued to monitor foreign currency exchange rates for potential impacts on our earnings projections, which Joe will discuss in his update. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to deliver excellent service across all of our distribution networks. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both received J.D. Power awards for residential customer satisfaction in July, achieving the highest overall marks in their respective categories and regions based on customer surveys. This year mark the eighth and fourth straight years respectively that PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities have earned this distinction. All told, PPL's utilities have received 49 J.D. Power awards in the 2 decades since the organization has steady customer satisfaction with electric utilities. In U.K., WPD was also recognized recently by Ofgem as the top-ranked network for the stakeholder engagement and consumer vulnerability incentive and achievement measured against all gas and electricity networks in the U.K. This is the eighth consecutive year that WPD led the industry in this category. 
PPL's track record of customer service excellence is a testament to the outstanding teams we have throughout our business and it reflects our strategic focus on delivering best-in-sector operational performance. In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities was also named the 2019 power players investor-owned utility of the year by the Smart Electric Power Alliance during the second quarter. The award recognized PPL Electrics work to create a smart grid distribution management system that supports greater adoption of distributed energy resources on the grid. This includes behind-the-meter resources such as private solar and energy storage. The Utilities new distributed energy resources management system is just one of the many ways PPL companies are working to advance a cleaner energy future. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was named one of the most trusted utility brands in the country by a recent study conducted by Escalent, a human behavior and analytics firm. In this survey, PPL Electric Utilities earned the top spot among the electricity-only utilities in the eastern United States. This recognition is yet another example of PPL Electrics commitment to top-tier reliability and service to its customers. 
Last but not least, Louisville Gas and Electric recently received the American Gas Association's accident prevention award for safety excellence. Among its peers, LG&E finished 2018 with the lowest rate of incidents resulting in lost time or restricted time at work. We are proud of LG&E's accomplishment, and we remain committed across our U.S. and U.K. operations to continue a safety improvement. Turning to a brief regulatory update in the U.K., Ofgem in late May confirmed its RIIO-2 price control methodology for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission subsectors. While the announced methodology does not apply to the electricity distribution sector, which Ofgem has continually emphasized, we welcome the opportunity to share our views on some key issues. Broadly, we believe this update was a step in the right direction and look forward to our ongoing engagement with Ofgem as we plan our next price control. Our process that kicked off formally this morning with the open letter consultation. The letter was generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent conversations with Ofgem. Vince and I were in the U.K. last week and held another series of productive meetings with members of Ofgem senior leadership team, including Chairman Martin Cave. We discussed the successes of RIIO-ED1 regulation and how there has been real value delivered to customers in the first 4 years of the price control. We also highlighted some of the areas for improvement and how Ofgem can achieve their objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Overall, we're in agreement that the distribution networks are critical to the ongoing development of the U.K.'s energy infrastructure, specifically to achieve the electrification and decarbonization initiatives. 
Network development has become even more important as the U.K. recently announced its commitment to achieving net 0 carbon emissions by the year 2050. This commitment further enhances the opportunities for DNOs, like WPD, to continue their leading roles in building the electricity grid of the future and connecting significant levels of renewable energy sources. We expect that Ofgem will provide the framework necessary for electricity distribution companies to support these objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so as they have done historically. 
Our recent dialogue supports our belief that Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs and still provide substantial opportunities for outstanding performers, like WPD, during the next price control period. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the second quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered second quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.58 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to the second quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong second -- our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution and $0.05 of weather-related variances compared to the prior period. $0.04 of the weather variance was related to strong volumes experienced in the second quarter of 2018 and weather was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to our forecast for the second quarter of 2019. Excluding dilution and weather, we saw higher earnings in each of our utility segments this quarter. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.36 per share, a $0.04 increase compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins from higher prices as a result of the April 1, 2019, price increase partially offset by lower sales volume, higher other income due to higher pension income and higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018 for the second quarter 2019 average rate of a $1.36 per pound compared to $1.33 in the second quarter of 2018. Moving to Pennsylvania. our Pennsylvania regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and the timing impact related to U.S. tax reform in 2018 and lower operation and maintenance expense primarily due to lower support cost. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E. 
Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the second quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of weather. The increase was primarily due to higher base rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower income taxes due to a state tax credit. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates, and higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings. And finally, Corporate and Other remained flat over the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, our solid second quarter performance positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. We provided a similar walk of the year-to-date results in the appendix for your reference. Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. 
For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.41 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage to 63% compared to 55% on our first quarter call. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges is $1.46 per pound just slightly lower than the previous average of $1.47. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates to develop 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. We remain open in 2021, and as Bill mentioned we recognized the recent weakness in the exchange rates and continue to monitor potential impacts to our earnings projections. However, independent forecast of future exchange rates remain within the range of presumptions used for our 2021 projections. While near term fluctuations in the currency is expected given the current political environment, the majority of analysts project a recovery in the currency rates following a Brexit resolution. And finally, we have flexibility in our hedging program that does not require us to add additional hedges at this time and allows us to take an opportunistic approach to hedging as we monitor the dynamics of the political situation and move towards the Brexit deadline in October. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

These operational successes are underpinned by an exceptional workplace that cultivates an inclusive and diverse workforce. I'd like to briefly highlight a couple recent honors recognizing these efforts that exemplify the constructive culture and lifeblood of our company. In June, our Kentucky operations were rewarded the highest U.S. government honor to employers for providing exceptional support of National Guard and Reserve employees. The employer support of the Guard and Reserve earned an ESGR Freedom Award. We were one of 15 recipients of this prestigious award selected by the Department of Defense out of nearly 2,500 nominations this year. And just last month, PPL was named a Best Place to Work for people with disabilities for the second straight year, earning a top score of 100% on the disability equality index for its commitment to creating and accommodating an inclusive environment for people with disabilities. At PPL, we want all individuals to reach their fullest potential and believe that our employees, colleagues and friends in the community of all abilities help us grow and thrive. We're extremely honored and proud of these achievements, and we will continue to advance in these efforts for an inclusive, empowering environment for all employees to drive energy forward.

And that track record includes much lower cost than when the systems were nationalized, better reliability, much better reliability to the tune of about 60% better reliability than when they were under state control. And also customer satisfaction, which is at the highest level it's ever been. So we have a great story to tell and another data point is, which is on a positive side is that the Labour Party has really continued to lose momentum politically and as you know they were one of the -- one of the only political party that had proposed bringing some of the networks back under state control as well as rail and mail and so forth. And water. So we think that the risk, while it was already very low is even lower than it previously was as the Labour Party has really failed to gain any momentum politically and certainly there is a -- always a probability that they could regain some of their footing but in our view very unlikely. So the other thing that we've been doing is we have a political consulting firm that we use in the U.K. It's been very helpful for us to reach out to some of the other stakeholders outside the parliament to again, educate and inform local community and leaders and so forth. So I think we're doing what we can to combat some of the broader political forces at play. But it is rather challenging."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 third quarter earnings results and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of third quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share, resulting in a total of $1.89 per share through the first 9 months of 2019. Adjusting for special items primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.61 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, through September, total ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, which was even with last year on a per share basis and in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through September, we have narrowed our 2019 guidance range to $2.35 per share to $2.45 per share, maintaining our midpoint of $2.40. And in addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019. 
Looking beyond 2019, today, we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth rate per share through 2020, measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continue to monitor macroeconomic factors for potential impacts on our earnings projections, including impacts on currency exchange rates, inflation in the U.K. and interest rates. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to modernize and reshape the grid, investing in infrastructure and technology that will further strengthen grid resilience, improve service to customers and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. In the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities near completion of a multi-year advanced meter replacement project in Pennsylvania. This $470 million project involves the installation of 1.4 million advanced meters. These meters enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer requests by remotely connecting and disconnecting service. They also provide customers with more detailed usage information to help them make wise energy decisions. They also alert us when power is out, enabling us to respond more quickly to notify customers when they're not home and to better pinpoint problem areas. In addition, they help us to monitor power quality and better identify and address potential problems before they impact electric service. We expect to complete the project this year. It's yet another example of our ability to execute large-scale capital projects on time and on budget. Additionally, PPL electric utilities was recognized in October by the Association of Edison illuminating companies for groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public first responders as well as employees. Safety is paramount to our everyday operations, and we're very proud of our team for developing this innovative technology that will enhance the safety of our distribution network. We expect to have this technology deployed in about 1,500 locations across our Pennsylvania service territory by the end of this year. 
In Kentucky, meanwhile, Louisville Gas and Electric company and Kentucky Utilities company continue to look for opportunities to economically add clean energy for our customers. The company has completed construction of a new community solar facility in late July. This 1,400 panel array is the first of 8-plan solar share developments that will provide an option for customers to support local solar energy without installing equipment on their properties. We are very close to beginning the installation of the second solar share array as response from customers has been strong. In addition, Kentucky Utilities announced an agreement to build, own and maintain a solar array at a maker's Mark Bourbon Distillery Operation and Laredo, Kentucky as part of the Utilities business solar program. The company expects to complete construction by the end of the year. Our continuous investment in our reliable electricity system in Kentucky also enables us to continue to pursue these efforts of economically advancing renewable generation in the state of Kentucky. 
Shifting to the U.K. and a brief regulatory update, as we noted on our second quarter call, Ofgem formally kicked off the consultation process for the RIIO-ED2 price control in early August. We've since reviewed Ofgem's open letter, which outlines its approach to setting the next price control. And we've submitted responses on behalf of all stakeholders of both, Western Power Distribution and PPL Corporation, including our share owners. In PPL's response, we highlighted the real value that RIIO-ED1 has delivered and continues to deliver for our U.K. customers. For example, customer interruptions are down 11% on average. Outage durations have fallen by 9%. Customer service scores are very strong, with distribution network operators earning on average an 8.7 out of 10 rating from our customers. Meanwhile, have continued to invest in network improvements and innovation. 4 years into the RIIO-ED1 price control, customers are receiving high levels of service and performance. In our view, the focus in RIIO-ED2 should be building upon the success of RIIO-ED1 and refining the framework where needed. As stated in our comments, we welcome the opportunity to support U.K. decarbonization and electrification initiatives that will play a critical role in achieving the government's target of net 0 emissions by the year 2050. We forecast that a significant amount of capital will be required to be invested in the distribution networks to advance these objectives. We believe it's critical that RIIO-ED2 provide D&O's fair and reasonable returns that will attract and sustain the investment necessary to achieve this transition to a low-carbon economy. And we believe the incentive scheme in RIIO-ED2 must drive both innovation and outputs that create long-term value for our customers and enable top performers like to earn strong returns. Much of these concepts have been echoed by our investors, and we provided Ofgem with a summary of that direct feedback as well. 
In WPD's comprehensive response to the consultation questions, we've highlighted areas for improvement and offered ideas on how Opgem can achieve its objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Ofgem is expected to issue its framework decision by the end of the year. As we said on our last call, we believe Ofgem agrees that distribution networks are critical to enabling the shift towards a more sustainable energy future. We expect that Ofgem will produce the framework necessary for DNOs to support decarbonization objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so. And we believe Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs, providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD as we enter into RIIO-ED2. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of third quarter segment results. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered
third quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.61 per share, which was $0.02 higher compared to the third quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution. And over the quarter, there was a $0.01 benefit from weather-related variances compared to the prior period. Weather was about $0.02 favorable compared to our forecast for the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky, where cooling degree days were about 30% higher compared to normalized levels. 
Turning to our segment results. Our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.28 per share, a $0.01 decrease compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution. The decrease in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018, with third quarter 2019 average rates of $1.26 per pound compared to $1.34 per pound in the third quarter of 2018. These factors were partially offset by higher prices due to the April 1, 2019, price increase and higher other income due to higher pension income. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our PA regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2019, which was even compared to the third quarter of 2018. Higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission were primarily offset by higher operation and maintenance expense and several other items that were not individually significant. 
Turning to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky regulated segment earned $0.20 per share in the third quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the third quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which reflect higher retail rates approved by the KPSC effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to lower storm costs. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions of the PP&E and higher depreciation rates. And finally, corporate and other remained relatively even compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, we narrowed our 2019 forecast range due to our strong third quarter performance, which positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. And for your convenience, a walk of the year-to-date results is available in the appendix. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.45 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage by 7% and our 2020 ongoing earnings are now 70% hedged. The average rate for 2020, reflecting these new hedges, remain at $1.46 per pound. We were able to maintain these average hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio, given the recent uplift in currency rates following the momentum surrounding Brexit and to strengthen our 2019 results to date. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option based, and we remain open in 2021. As Bill mentioned, we'll continue to monitor Brexit developments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, while we evaluate potential impacts for earnings projections. The flexibility in our hedging program enables us to take an opportunistic approach as we continue to assess the dynamic political situation. We believe we're well positioned to manage this uncertainty in the near-term through our hedge position. And we are optimistic that the market will rationalize the currency rates higher than we see today and continue the recent upward trend as the U.K. moves closer toward Brexit resolution. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

Bill alluded to that in his opening remarks in terms of outcomes for our customers. The interruptions on minutes dramatically down. And our availability of electricity running 99.99%. In terms of customer service, we continue to drive that upwards with WPD now at or around, over 90% and the whole sector has moved up to around about 87%. So our key message but ofgem been very much around progressing into ED2 with a good incentive package reflecting the decarbonization agenda. And we see that as the main adjustment going forward.

Well, the capital plan that you have in front of you today reflects only identified projects, and there are certainly opportunities that could arise as we execute the plan, particularly at the back end of the plan, as you know. Those potential opportunities within that 5-year time horizon could come from a couple of sources. One would be further grid resiliency efforts in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, future AMI deployment in Kentucky, which we've talked about in the past, potential renewables expansion, I would just say, in general, across the Board; perhaps other generation modifications in Kentucky that could be required by any new environmental regulations. I think as you probably know, our capital plans in the U.K. are essentially set until the end of RIIO-ED1. And we do expect beyond that time frame, beyond RIIO-ED1 that there could be very significant capital investment opportunities to meet the required electrification initiatives to allow the U.K. to achieve its recent commitment of a net 0 emissions by 2050. So that's -- those are the areas that I would probably highlight at the moment."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 third quarter earnings results and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of third quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share, resulting in a total of $1.89 per share through the first 9 months of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.61 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis, through September, total ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, which was even with last year on a per share basis and in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through September, we have narrowed our 2019 guidance range to $2.35 per share to $2.45 per share, maintaining our midpoint of $2.40. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019. 
Looking beyond 2019, today, we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth rate per share through 2020, measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continue to monitor macroeconomic factors for potential impacts on our earnings projections, including impacts on currency exchange rates, inflation in the U.K. and interest rates. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to modernize and reshape the grid, investing in infrastructure and technology that will further strengthen grid resilience, improve service to customers and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. 
In the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities neared completion of a multiyear advanced meter replacement project in Pennsylvania. This $470 million project involves the installation of 1.4 million advanced meters. These meters enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer requests by remotely connecting and disconnecting service. They also provide customers with more detailed usage information to help them make wise energy decisions. They also alert us when power is out, enabling us to respond more quickly to notify customers when they're not home and to better pinpoint problem areas. In addition, they help us to monitor power quality and better identify and address potential problems before they impact electric service. 
We expect to complete the project this year. It's yet another example of our ability to execute large-scale capital projects on time and on budget. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was recognized in October by the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies for groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public first responders as well as employees. Safety is paramount to our everyday operations, and we're very proud of our team for developing this innovative technology that will enhance the safety of our distribution network. We expect to have this technology deployed in about 1,500 locations across our Pennsylvania service territory by the end of this year. 
In Kentucky, meanwhile, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company continued to look for opportunities to economically add clean energy for our customers. The company has completed construction of a new community solar facility in late July. This 1,400-panel array is the first of 8 plan Solar Share developments that will provide an option for customers to support local solar energy without installing equipment on their properties. We are very close to beginning the installation of the second Solar Share array as response from customers has been strong. 
In addition, Kentucky Utilities announced an agreement to build, own and maintain a solar array at the Maker's Mark bourbon distillery operation in Loretto, Kentucky as part of the utility's Business Solar Program. The company expects to complete construction by the end of the year. Our continuous investment in our reliable electricity system in Kentucky also enables us to continue to pursue these efforts of economically advancing renewable generation in the state of Kentucky. 
Shifting to the U.K. and a brief regulatory update. As we noted on our second quarter call, Ofgem formally kicked off the consultation process for the RIIO-ED2 price control in early August. We've since reviewed Ofgem's open letter, which outlines its approach to setting the next price control, and we've submitted responses on behalf of all stakeholders of both, Western Power Distribution and PPL Corporation, including our shareowners. 
In PPL's response, we highlighted the real value that RIIO-ED1 has delivered and continues to deliver for our U.K. customers. For example, customer interruptions are down 11% on average. Outage durations have fallen by 9%. Customer service scores are very strong, with distribution network operators earning on average an 8.7 out of 10 rating from our customers. Meanwhile, DNOs have continued to invest in network improvements and innovation. 
4 years into the RIIO-ED1 price control, customers are receiving high levels of service and performance. And in our view, the focus in RIIO-ED2 should be building upon the success of RIIO-ED1 and refining the framework where needed. As stated in our comments, we welcome the opportunity to support U.K. decarbonization and electrification initiatives that will play a critical role in achieving the government's target of net 0 emissions by the year 2050. We forecast that a significant amount of capital will be required to be invested in the distribution networks to advance these objectives. We believe it's critical that RIIO-ED2 provide DNOs fair and reasonable returns that will attract and sustain the investment necessary to achieve this transition to a low-carbon economy. And we believe the incentive scheme in RIIO-ED2 must drive both innovation and outputs that create long-term value for our customers and enable top performers like WPD to earn strong returns. Much of these concepts have been echoed by our investors, and we provided Ofgem with a summary of that direct feedback as well. 
In WPD's comprehensive response to the consultation questions, we've highlighted areas for improvement and offered ideas on how Opgem can achieve its objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Ofgem is expected to issue its framework decision by the end of the year. As we said on our last call, we believe Ofgem agrees that distribution networks are critical to enabling the shift towards a more sustainable energy future. We expect that Ofgem will produce the framework necessary for DNOs to support decarbonization objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so. And we believe Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs, providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD as we enter into RIIO-ED2. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of third quarter segment results. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered third quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.61 per share, which was $0.02 higher compared to the third quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution. And over the quarter, there was $0.01 benefit from weather-related variances compared to the prior period. Weather was about $0.02 favorable compared to our forecast for the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky, where cooling degree days were about 30% higher compared to normalized levels. 
Turning to our segment results. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.28 per share, a $0.01 decrease compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution. The decrease in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018, with third quarter 2019 average rates of $1.26 per pound compared to $1.34 per pound in the third quarter of 2018. These factors were partially offset by higher prices due to the April 1, 2019, price increase and higher other income due to higher pension income. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our PA Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2019, which was even compared to the third quarter of 2018. Higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, were primarily offset by higher operation and maintenance expense and several other items that were not individually significant. 
Turning to Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.20 per share in the third quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the third quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which reflect higher retail rates approved by the KPSC effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to lower storm costs. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates. And finally, Corporate and Other remained relatively even compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, we narrowed our 2019 forecast range due to our strong third quarter performance, which positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. And for your convenience, a walk of the year-to-date results is available in the appendix. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.45 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage by 7%, and our 2020 ongoing earnings are now 70% hedged. The average rate for 2020 reflecting these new hedges remained at $1.46 per pound. 
We were able to maintain these average hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio, given the recent uplift in currency rates following the momentum surrounding Brexit and to strengthen our 2019 results to date. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And we remain opened in 2021. As Bill mentioned, we'll continue to monitor Brexit developments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, while we evaluate potential impacts for earnings projections. 
The flexibility in our hedging program enables us to take an opportunistic approach as we continue to assess the dynamic political situation. We believe we're well positioned to manage this uncertainty in the near term through our hedge position. And we are optimistic that the market will rationalize the currency rates higher than we see today and continue the recent upward trend as the U.K. moves closer toward a Brexit resolution. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

The actual sector methodology consultation is actually next year when we get more detail on the financial package and everything else. Right now, our position is very much around focusing Ofgem on the fact that ED1 is working incredibly well. And therefore, ED2 should be a progression from ED1 and not a sort of a step change away from it. Bill alluded to that in his opening remarks in terms of outcomes for our customers. The interruptions on minutes are dramatically down. And our availability of electricity is running 99.99%. In terms of customer service, we continue to drive that upwards with WPD now at or around over 90%, and the whole sector has moved up to around about 87%. So our key messaging with Ofgem has been very much around progressing into ED2 with a good incentive package reflecting the decarbonization agenda. And we see that as the main adjustment going forward. But in terms of decisions in terms of cost of equity and everything else, we won't see that until next year."

Well, the capital plan that you have in front of you today reflects only identified projects.

Those potential opportunities within that 5-year time horizon could come from a couple of sources. One would be further grid resiliency efforts in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky; future AMI deployment in Kentucky, which we've talked about in the past; potential renewables expansion, I would just say, in general across the board; perhaps other generation modifications in Kentucky that could be required by any new environmental regulations. 
I think as you probably know, our capital plans in the U.K. are essentially set until the end of RIIO-ED1. And we do expect beyond that time frame, beyond RIIO-ED1 that there could be very significant capital investment opportunities to meet the required electrification initiatives to allow the U.K. to achieve its recent commitment of a net 0 emissions by 2050.

So one of the things that we're doing now, as we've commented on, is going to test the market with an RFP for renewables. We put that out in February. That was for upwards of 200 megawatts. We're still processing that. But based on that, we expect to see some filings to move forward on some more renewable energy that is economic to the customer set. So things like that in the near term, we're going to continue to do. 
When you get out into the later '20s and as we had in our climate assessment report, we talked about, as coal becomes not economic for whatever reason or ages to the point of not being able to be economically retrofitted, et cetera, we will likely be looking at renewables and/or gas as the economics may dictate.

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 third quarter earnings results and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of third quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share, resulting in a total of $1.89 per share through the first 9 months of 2019. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.61 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis, through September, total ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, which was even with last year on a per share basis and in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through September, we have narrowed our 2019 guidance range to $2.35 per share to $2.45 per share, maintaining our midpoint of $2.40. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019. 
Looking beyond 2019, today, we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth rate per share through 2020, measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continue to monitor macroeconomic factors for potential impacts on our earnings projections, including impacts on currency exchange rates, inflation in the U.K. and interest rates. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to modernize and reshape the grid, investing in infrastructure and technology that will further strengthen grid resilience, improve service to customers and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. 
In the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities neared completion of a multiyear advanced meter replacement project in Pennsylvania. This $470 million project involve the installation of 1.4 million advanced meters. These meters enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer requests by remotely connecting and disconnecting service. They also provide customers with more detailed usage information to help them make wise energy decisions. They also alert us when power is out, enabling us to respond more quickly to notify customers when they're not home and to better pinpoint problem areas. In addition, they help us to monitor power quality and better identify and address potential problems before they impact electric service. 
We expect to complete the project this year. It's yet another example of our ability to execute large-scale capital projects on time and on budget. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was recognized in October by the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies for groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public first responders as well as employees. Safety is paramount to our everyday operations, and we're very proud of our team for developing this innovative technology that will enhance the safety of our distribution network. We expect to have this technology deployed in about 1,500 locations across our Pennsylvania service territory by the end of this year. 
In Kentucky, meanwhile, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company continued to look for opportunities to economically add clean energy for our customers. The company has completed construction of a new community solar facility in late July. This 1,400-panel array is the first of 8 planned Solar Share developments that will provide an option for customers to support local solar energy without installing equipment on their properties. We are very close to the beginning -- to beginning the installation of the second Solar Share array as response from customers has been strong. 
In addition, Kentucky Utilities announced an agreement to build, own and maintain a solar array at the Maker's Mark bourbon distillery operation in Loretto, Kentucky as part of the Utility's Business Solar Program. The company expects to complete construction by the end of the year. Our continuous investment in our reliable electricity system in Kentucky also enables us to continue to pursue these efforts of economically advancing renewable generation in the state of Kentucky. 
Shifting to the U.K. and a brief regulatory update. As we noted on our second quarter call, Ofgem formally kicked off the consultation process for the RIIO-ED2 price control in early August. We've since reviewed Ofgem's open letter, which outlines its approach to setting the next price control, and we've submitted responses on behalf of all stakeholders of both, Western Power Distribution and PPL Corporation, including our shareowners. 
In PPL's response, we highlighted the real value that RIIO-ED1 has delivered and continues to deliver for our U.K. customers. For example, customer interruptions are down 11% on average. Outage durations have fallen by 9%. Customer service scores are very strong, with distribution network operators earning on average an 8.7 out of 10 rating from our customers. Meanwhile, DNOs have continued to invest in network improvements and innovation. 
4 years into the RIIO-ED1 price control, customers are receiving high levels of service and performance. And in our view, the focus in RIIO-ED2 should be -- to be build -- building upon the success of RIIO-ED1 and refining the framework where needed. As stated in our comments, we welcome the opportunity to support U.K. decarbonization and electrification initiatives that will play a critical role in achieving the government's target of net 0 emissions by the year 2050. We forecast that a significant amount of capital will be required to be invested in the distribution networks to advance these objectives. We believe it's critical that RIIO-ED2 provide DNOs fair and reasonable returns that will attract and sustain the investment necessary to achieve this transition to a low-carbon economy. And we believe the incentive scheme in RIIO-ED2 must drive both innovation and outputs that create long-term value for our customers and enable top performers like WPD to earn strong returns. Much of these concepts have been echoed by our investors, and we provided Ofgem with a summary of that direct feedback as well. 
In WPD's comprehensive response to the consultation questions, we've highlighted areas for improvement and offered ideas on how Ofgem can achieve its objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Ofgem is expected to issue its framework decision by the end of the year. As we said on our last call, we believe Ofgem agrees that distribution networks are critical to enabling the shift towards a more sustainable energy future. We expect that Ofgem will produce the framework necessary for DNOs to support decarbonization objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so. And we believe Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs, providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD as we enter into RIIO-ED2. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of third quarter segment results. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered third quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.61 per share, which was $0.02 higher compared to the third quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution. And over the quarter, there was $0.01 benefit from weather-related variances compared to the prior period. Weather was about $0.02 favorable compared to our forecast for the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky, where cooling degree days were about 30% higher compared to normalized levels. 
Turning to our segment results. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.28 per share, a $0.01 decrease compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution. The decrease in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018, with third quarter 2019 average rates of $1.26 per pound compared to $1.34 per pound in the third quarter of 2018. These factors were partially offset by higher prices due to the April 1, 2019, price increase and higher other income due to higher pension income. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our PA Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2019, which was even compared to the third quarter of 2018. Higher adjusted gross margins, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, were primarily offset by higher operation and maintenance expense and several other items that were not individually significant. 
Turning to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.20 per share in the third quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the third quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which reflect higher retail rates approved by the KPSC effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense, primarily due to lower storm costs. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates. And finally, Corporate and Other remained relatively even compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, we narrowed our 2019 forecast range due to our strong third quarter performance, which positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. And for your convenience, a walk of the year-to-date results is available in the appendix. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.45 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage by 7%, and our 2020 ongoing earnings are now 70% hedged. The average rate for 2020 reflecting these new hedges remained at $1.46 per pound. 
We were able to maintain these average hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio, given the recent uplift in currency rates following the momentum surrounding Brexit and to strengthen our 2019 results to date. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And we remain opened in 2021. As Bill mentioned, we'll continue to monitor Brexit developments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, while we evaluate potential impacts for earnings projections. 
The flexibility in our hedging program enables us to take an opportunistic approach as we continue to assess the dynamic political situation. We believe we're well positioned to manage this uncertainty in the near-term through our hedge position. And we are optimistic that the market will rationalize the currency rates higher than we see today and continue the recent upward trend as the U.K. moves closer toward a Brexit resolution. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

The actual sector methodology consultation is actually next year when we get more detail on the financial package and everything else. Right now, our position is very much around focusing on Ofgem on the fact that ED1 is working incredibly well. And therefore, ED2 should be a progression from ED1 and not a sort of a step change away from it. Bill alluded to that in his opening remarks in terms of outcomes for our customers. The interruptions on minutes are dramatically down. And our availability of electricity is running 99.99%. In terms of customer service, we continue to drive that upwards with WPD now at/or around over 90%, and the whole sector has moved up to around about 87%. So our key messaging with Ofgem has been very much around progressing into ED2 with a good incentive package reflecting the decarbonization agenda. And we see that as the main adjustment going forward. But in terms of decisions in terms of cost of equity and everything else, we won't see that until next year."

Well, the capital plan that you have in front of you today reflects only identified projects. And there are certainly opportunities that could arise as we execute the plan, particularly at the back-end of the plan, as you know. Those potential opportunities within that 5-year time horizon could come from a couple of sources. One would be further grid resiliency efforts in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky; future AMI deployment in Kentucky, which we've talked about in the past; potential renewables expansion, I would just say, in general across the board; perhaps other generation modifications in Kentucky that could be required by any new environmental regulations. 
I think as you probably know, our capital plans in the U.K. are essentially set until the end of RIIO-ED1. And we do expect beyond that time frame, beyond RIIO-ED1 that there could be very significant capital investment opportunities to meet the required electrification initiatives to allow the U.K. to achieve its recent commitment of a net 0 emissions by 2050.

We have a investor -- I mean, a -- an integrated resource plan that, of course, we do tri-annually, and it still has coal as our least cost resource going out into the late '20s, early '30s, when we might see some more change. But aside from that, we're looking at the market all the time, and as Bill said earlier, looking for economic advantages for the customer. So one of the things that we're doing now, as we've commented on, is going to test the market with an RFP for renewables. We put that out in February. That was for upwards of 200 megawatts. We're still processing that. But based on that, we expect to see some filings to move forward on some more renewable energy that is economic to the customer set. So things like that in the near-term, we're going to continue to do. 
When you get out into the later '20s and as we had in our climate assessment report, we talked about, as coal becomes not economic for whatever reason or ages to the point of not being able to be economically retrofitted, et cetera, we will likely be looking at renewables and/or gas as the economics may dictate. So I think we're trying to stay on the forefront of what's economic to the customer. And some of this renewable certainly can be, and that's what we're going to try to keep doing in the state."

Moving to Slide 3. Our agenda this morning begins with highlights of our 2019 third quarter earnings results and a brief review of operational and regulatory developments. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of third quarter earnings as well as an update on our foreign currency hedging status. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.65 per share, resulting in a total of $1.89 per share through the first 9 months of 2019. Adjusting for special items primarily related to unrealized gains on our U.K. earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.61 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis, through September, total ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, which was even with last year on a per share basis and in line with our expectations. Based on our solid financial results through September, we have narrowed our 2019 guidance range to $2.35 per share to $2.45 per share, maintaining our midpoint of $2.40. In addition, we remain on track to invest $3.3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2019. 
Looking beyond 2019, today, we also reaffirmed our projection of 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth rate per share through 2020, measured against the midpoint of our original 2018 earnings forecast of $2.30 per share. In addition, we maintained our 2021 earnings forecast of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We continue to monitor macroeconomic factors for potential impacts on our earnings projections, including impacts on currency exchange rates, inflation in the U.K. and interest rates. 
Shifting the focus to operations. PPL continues to modernize and reshape the grid, investing in infrastructure and technology that will further strengthen grid resilience, improve service to customers and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. 
In the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities neared completion of a multiyear advanced meter replacement project in Pennsylvania. This $470 million project involve the installation of 1.4 million advanced meters. These meters enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer requests by remotely connecting and disconnecting service. They also provide customers with more detailed usage information to help them make wise energy decisions. They also alert us when power is out, enabling us to respond more quickly to notify customers when they're not home and to better pinpoint problem areas. In addition, they help us to monitor power quality and better identify and address potential problems before they impact electric service. 
We expect to complete the project this year. It's yet another example of our ability to execute large-scale capital projects on time and on budget. Additionally, PPL Electric Utilities was recognized in October by the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies for groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power lines, protecting the public first responders as well as employees. Safety is paramount to our everyday operations, and we're very proud of our team for developing this innovative technology that will enhance the safety of our distribution network. We expect to have this technology deployed in about 1,500 locations across our Pennsylvania service territory by the end of this year. 
In Kentucky, meanwhile, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company continued to look for opportunities to economically add clean energy for our customers. The company has completed construction of a new community solar facility in late July. This 1,400-panel array is the first of 8 planned Solar Share developments that will provide an option for customers to support local solar energy without installing equipment on their properties. We are very close to the beginning -- to beginning the installation of the second Solar Share array as response from customers has been strong. 
In addition, Kentucky Utilities announced an agreement to build, own and maintain a solar array at the Maker's Mark bourbon distillery operation in Loretto, Kentucky as part of the Utility's Business Solar Program. The company expects to complete construction by the end of the year. Our continuous investment in our reliable electricity system in Kentucky also enables us to continue to pursue these efforts of economically advancing renewable generation in the state of Kentucky. 
Shifting to the U.K. and a brief regulatory update. As we noted on our second quarter call, Ofgem formally kicked off the consultation process for the RIIO-ED2 price control in early August. We've since reviewed Ofgem's open letter, which outlines its approach to setting the next price control, and we've submitted responses on behalf of all stakeholders of both, Western Power Distribution and PPL Corporation, including our shareowners. 
In PPL's response, we highlighted the real value that RIIO-ED1 has delivered and continues to deliver for our U.K. customers. For example, customer interruptions are down 11% on average. Outage durations have fallen by 9%. Customer service scores are very strong, with distribution network operators earning on average an 8.7 out of 10 rating from our customers. Meanwhile, DNOs have continued to invest in network improvements and innovation. 
4 years into the RIIO-ED1 price control, customers are receiving high levels of service and performance. And in our view, the focus in RIIO-ED2 should be -- to be build -- building upon the success of RIIO-ED1 and refining the framework where needed. As stated in our comments, we welcome the opportunity to support U.K. decarbonization and electrification initiatives that will play a critical role in achieving the government's target of net 0 emissions by the year 2050. We forecast that a significant amount of capital will be required to be invested in the distribution networks to advance these objectives. We believe it's critical that RIIO-ED2 provide DNOs fair and reasonable returns that will attract and sustain the investment necessary to achieve this transition to a low-carbon economy. And we believe the incentive scheme in RIIO-ED2 must drive both innovation and outputs that create long-term value for our customers and enable top performers like WPD to earn strong returns. Much of these concepts have been echoed by our investors, and we provided Ofgem with a summary of that direct feedback as well. 
In WPD's comprehensive response to the consultation questions, we've highlighted areas for improvement and offered ideas on how Ofgem can achieve its objective of continuing to drive efficiencies while preparing the network for the future. Ofgem is expected to issue its framework decision by the end of the year. As we said on our last call, we believe Ofgem agrees that distribution networks are critical to enabling the shift towards a more sustainable energy future. We expect that Ofgem will produce the framework necessary for DNOs to support decarbonization objectives and incentivize the level of investment required to do so. And we believe Ofgem will be focused on differentiating returns among electricity DNOs, providing substantial opportunities for outstanding performers like WPD as we enter into RIIO-ED2. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial overview. Joe?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of third quarter segment results. 
As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered third quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.61 per share, which was $0.02 higher compared to the third quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. Our strong results more than offset $0.02 from share dilution. And over the quarter, there was $0.01 benefit from weather-related variances compared to the prior period. Weather was about $0.02 favorable compared to our forecast for the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky, where cooling degree days were about 30% higher compared to normalized levels. 
Turning to our segment results. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.28 per share, a $0.01 decrease compared to the same period a year ago, excluding the impact of dilution. The decrease in the U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower sales volumes and lower realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to 2018, with third quarter 2019 average rates of $1.26 per pound compared to $1.34 per pound in the third quarter of 2018. These factors were partially offset by higher prices due to the April 1, 2019, price increase and higher other income due to higher pension income. 
Moving to the Pennsylvania segment. Our PA Regulated segment earned $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2019, which was even compared to the third quarter of 2018. Higher adjusted gross margins primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, were primarily offset by higher operation and maintenance expense and several other items that were not individually significant. 
Turning to the Kentucky segment. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.20 per share in the third quarter of 2019, a $0.03 increase compared to the third quarter of 2018, excluding the impact of dilution and weather. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which reflect higher retail rates approved by the KPSC effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense primarily due to lower storm costs. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to additions to PP&E and higher depreciation rates. And finally, Corporate and Other remained relatively even compared to the same period a year ago. 
As Bill noted, we narrowed our 2019 forecast range due to our strong third quarter performance, which positions us well to achieve our earnings forecast for this year. And for your convenience, a walk of the year-to-date results is available in the appendix. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bill, let me provide an update on our foreign currency hedging status, which is on Slide 6. For the balance of 2019, we continue to be 100% hedged for our ongoing earnings at an average rate of $1.45 per pound. For 2020, we increased our hedge percentage by 7%, and our 2020 ongoing earnings are now 70% hedged. The average rate for 2020 reflecting these new hedges remained at $1.46 per pound. 
We were able to maintain these average hedge rates by optimizing our hedge portfolio, given the recent uplift in currency rates following the momentum surrounding Brexit and to strengthen our 2019 results to date. We continue to utilize options in our hedging strategy that preserve upside to the current market rates with about 1/3 of the 2020 hedge portfolio being option-based. And we remain opened in 2021. As Bill mentioned, we'll continue to monitor Brexit developments and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, while we evaluate potential impacts for earnings projections. 
The flexibility in our hedging program enables us to take an opportunistic approach as we continue to assess the dynamic political situation. We believe we're well positioned to manage this uncertainty in the near-term through our hedge position. And we are optimistic that the market will rationalize the currency rates higher than we see today and continue the recent upward trend as the U.K. moves closer toward a Brexit resolution. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And therefore, ED2 should be a progression from ED1 and not a sort of a step change away from it. Bill alluded to that in his opening remarks in terms of outcomes for our customers. The interruptions on minutes are dramatically down. And our availability of electricity is running 99.99%. 
In terms of customer service, we continue to drive that upwards with WPD now at/or around over 90%, and the whole sector has moved up to around about 87%. So our key messaging with Ofgem has been very much around progressing into ED2 with a good incentive package reflecting the decarbonization agenda.

Well, the capital plan that you have in front of you today reflects only identified projects. And there are certainly opportunities that could arise as we execute the plan, particularly at the back-end of the plan, as you know. Those potential opportunities within that 5-year time horizon could come from a couple of sources. One would be further grid resiliency efforts in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky; future AMI deployment in Kentucky, which we've talked about in the past; potential renewables expansion, I would just say, in general across the board; perhaps other generation modifications in Kentucky that could be required by any new environmental regulations. 
I think as you probably know, our capital plans in the U.K. are essentially set until the end of RIIO-ED1. And we do expect beyond that time frame, beyond RIIO-ED1 that there could be very significant capital investment opportunities to meet the required electrification initiatives to allow the U.K. to achieve its recent commitment of a net 0 emissions by 2050. So that's -- those are the areas that I would probably highlight at the moment."

So one of the things that we're doing now, as we've commented on, is going to test the market with an RFP for renewables. We put that out in February. That was for upwards of 200 megawatts. We're still processing that. But based on that, we expect to see some filings to move forward on some more renewable energy that is economic to the customer set. So things like that in the near-term, we're going to continue to do. 
When you get out into the later '20s and as we had in our climate assessment report, we talked about, as coal becomes not economic for whatever reason or ages to the point of not being able to be economically retrofitted, et cetera, we will likely be looking at renewables and/or gas as the economics may dictate.
