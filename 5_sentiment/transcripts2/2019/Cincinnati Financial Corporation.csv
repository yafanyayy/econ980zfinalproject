260681,597497738,1649842,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2019",2019-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter results. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement",945,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter results. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities. Non-GAAP operating income improved for the quarter, and on a full year basis, it was 21% higher than 2017. 
We are encouraged by our 2018 financial results and continue to be confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it well. Improved operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 again reflected steady efforts to carefully underwrite and price policies, provide outstanding claims service, manage investments and support our agencies. Our fourth quarter 93.9% combined ratio helped lower full year 2018 to 96.4%, 1.1 points better than 2017. Slightly more favorable catastrophe weather effects in 2018 contributed 0.1 point, while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures. 
We continued to further segments our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis. That work is vital to a further improvement of underwriting results. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on the 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2019 GAAP combined ratio of low 95%. We also believe our 2019 property casualty premium growth rate can be within a percentage point of 2018.  We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
In 2018, we continued to manage our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for commercial lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. For personal lines, our policy retention during the second half of 2018 declined from recent year levels, reflecting increased underwriting discipline and was near the high end of the mid-80% range. 
Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value. In 2018, we appointed 167 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2019, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products, and another 80 that market only our personal lines products, primarily wants with a high net worth focus.  
We continued to earn new business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies.  For full year 2018, each of our property casualty segments reported record levels of new business written premiums, and overall property casualty net premiums grew 4%. 
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, our underwriters continued to generate overall price increases. Commercial lines estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter. Combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by a full percentage point for the year 2018 to 95.4%, despite the ratio for catastrophe losses increasing by 0.8 point. 
Our personal lines segment continued to experience a rise in average rate changes as the fourth quarter of 2018 was similar to the third quarter. Personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was profitable. While it was above 100% for the year 2018, it proved (sic) compared with year-end 2017 as we continued to work for performance improvement. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another year with excellent results, including double-digit growth in net written premiums and a 2018 combined ratio below 75%. Cincinnati Re continues to grow as planned, but was adversely affected by catastrophe losses from severe weather and wildfires. It finished the year with a combined ratio of 105.8%, which is consistent with our expectations for a year with global insured catastrophe losses roughly twice the long-term historical average. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line, with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 13% and full year 2018 growth at 9%. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings, as it has less correlation to weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2019 are similar to 2018. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing. 
The full year of 2018 value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, was negative 0.1%. The contribution from operating income was a positive 6.7%. The DCR in total was below our long-term target range due to the decline in securities market value. However, the DCR average for the past 5 years was within the target range. 
In conclusion, finishing the year well reflects areas of ongoing operational improvement. Despite the fourth quarter downturn in the stock market, the good performance of our insurance business was a key factor in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 5.7% increase in the regular cash dividend declared earlier this month. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several important points about our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led t",680,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led the way, up 9% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6% for the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio was flat for the year. The pretax average yield was 4.21% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 13 basis points from 2017's fourth quarter. We continued to invest in bonds including $347 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.48%, 60 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.69%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds throughout 2018. 
Our investment portfolio valuation was volatile for much of 2018 and on a full year basis, experienced an overall net loss of $741 million before tax effects. That included $395 million for our equity portfolio and $334 million for our bond portfolio. Even though those losses -- even with those losses, we ended the year with a net value of nearly $2.6 billion including $46 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows again exceeded $1 billion, and for full year 2018, exceeded the prior year by $129 million or 12%. 
I'll briefly comment on expense management, always an important part of our focus. While we continue to make thoughtful, strategic investments in our business, our full year 2018 operating property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.2 percentage points compared with the same period of 2017. 
Loss reserves are another important area. And our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years on both a fourth quarter and full year 2018 basis.
2018 marked our 30th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development. Full year 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points, matching the annual average during 2013 through 2017. Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $16 million of favorable reserve development during the fourth quarter -- during the quarter and $47 million for the year. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development in 2018. On on all-lines basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 23% for accident year 2016, and 39% for 2015 and prior accident years. 
We continued to actively manage our capital, and both financial strength and flexibility remained excellent. This week, we concluded efforts to enhance our financial flexibility by amending and extending our line of credit agreement with various banks. The former agreement was due to expire in May. The term is for 5 years for up to $300 million, and the accordion feature allows us to double that amount under the same terms and conditions. Most of the other terms and conditions are similar to the former agreement, although our financial flexibility also improved, with the elimination of a minimum net worth covenant and the debt to total capital maximum is now 35%. 
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.52. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.17. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.70. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $3.12 during the fourth quarter to $48.10 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

We have 2 Steves here, so we'll try to be careful to mention which one. this is Steve Johnston here, and I'll cover the reserve part. In terms of the releases, we have a very qualified actuarial department that uses some very sophisticated tools, particularly in the longtail line such as worker's compensation. they're looking at trends and explicitly looking at inflation in terms of medical inflation, of indemnity inflation, paid loss trends. And with all of the data that they look at, there's usually a little bit of a cautious eye towards worker's compensation in it's been a cyclical line over time. And that slight variation in actual results on some of the loss trend can have a large impact on the overall results, given the longtail nature of the line. So they have taken I think a very prudent approach to reserving workers' comp. And yet as they look at the more recent accident years going back in terms of how the actual trends have come in versus what they predicted, feel that it's prudent to release the reserves that they have. It's a very consistent position that they take, a consistent philosophy that they go about the reserve setting. In terms of the market conditions, I'll turn over to Steve Spray."

And I think no change has impacted our work comp results more than the things that we've done with claims, more expertise, a call center for timeliness of reporting have just helped medical repricing have just really helped the results of the year. I will tell you over the years, we are consciously looking ahead -- the continued base rate declines that come out of NCCI and the impact that, that's having on the accident year results.

Having spent the last couple of years in commercial lines, a lot of focus on commercial auto, Steve's right, we are seeing improvement in both the accident year and calendar year results. And one thing I point out is we continue to earn in really solid, high single-digit rate increases throughout 2018. We think that there's still plenty of runway in '19 for that to continue, but those high single-digit increases don't really tell the full story. I think our underwriting teams with our agents and working closely with our agents are really, executed well on segmenting the book. And we are getting obviously more than the average on the least adequately priced business, and less on the most adequately priced, really focused on retention on that adequately on that most adequately priced business. So still plenty of runway. There's still micro issues that are going on and commercial auto that you probably heard about distracted driving, driver shortages, policyholders having difficulty finding qualified individuals to put behind wheel. It's all having an effect on commercial auto."

If I don't hit, you obviously may follow up. The base rate declines are putting pressure on the growth. The underwriters I think are doing an excellent job of trying to mitigate that as much as possible. We still feel really good about the overall pricing of the book at this point in time. Again, those base rates are putting pressure. We are a package underwriter. So many times, when you write -- let me give you an example. If you're writing a package, and you're not real high on the auto, you're probably going to lose the entire package. You're not going to have an opportunity . But with worker's compensation, there's enough monoline markets out there, that if that line of business is not attractive to us, we can still continue to write the package and that comp won't end up going somewhere else. So it allows us to be I think more prudent and more conservative on the worker's compensation. So I think that covers it."

We've always been a company, as you know, that has built -- built around our distribution. And anything we do in here, as far as expanding products and services, is in direct reflection of what the agents' desires are of us. So as an example, our excess and surplus lines company, you can see how that's performing. High net worth, and the team and the growth that we've got there, we started the target markets division which is really niche products and commercial lines in direct response to agents' needs and the fact that they were majoring in specific industries or class segments. We're up to 15 of those now. We've made extensive product improvements in management liability and surety, especially on the management liability front. That segment is growing rapidly and is very profitable. We stay out of the public company sector. It's primarily nonprofit, small privately held companies as well. So that's performed well. So it kind of just goes on and on. Now with our Lloyd’s Syndicate, things that are always in direct -- again, it's always in direct response to the needs of our agents. We have another area that we are expanding is in commercial lines. And as we move upstream into larger, more complex risks for our agents, we feel like we have plenty of capacity. We just need to expand our expertise. We hired someone about 2.5 years ago, came over to join us, had tremendous amount of large account experience and expertise. he's building out that unit. it's just more important to our agents as well.

So it's just all around, it's been very good. It's rounded out the -- what our independent agents have in their toolbox for the insurers to be able to sell the insurance. From the annuity side, we just have fixed annuities. We don't do any variable annuities. So we think we do remain competitive there with the interest rates that we apply to those products. And we do look and adjust those quarterly to make sure that we are remaining competitive in that area. So overall, another -- I think a great year for the life company. Their non-GAAP operating income was 52 million this year compared to 40 million in the prior year. So with the premiums that are in there, the mortality was up a little higher than what we predicted at the beginning of the year.

It's about 90% casualty, about 10% of it property. So it's -- there's our agency plan today has about $3 billion of E&S business, of which we write roughly $260 million. So we just think that there is a long runway for us there."

Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement",948,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter results. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities. Non-GAAP operating income improved for the quarter, and on a full year basis, it was 21% higher than 2017. 
We are encouraged by our 2018 financial results and continue to be confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it well. Improved operating performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 again reflected steady efforts to carefully underwriting price policies, provide outstanding claims service, manage investments and support our agencies. Our fourth quarter 93.9% combined ratio helped lower full year 2018 to 96.4%, 1.1 points better than 2017. Slightly more favorable catastrophe weather effects in 2018 contributed 0.1 point, while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures. 
We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis. That work is vital to a further improvement of underwriting results. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on the 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2019 GAAP combined ratio below 95%. We also believe our 2019 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2018. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
In 2018, we continued to manage our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for commercial lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. For personal lines, our policy retention during the second half of 2018 declined from recent year levels, reflecting increased underwriting discipline and was near the high end of the mid-80% range. 
Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value. In 2018, we appointed 167 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2019, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products, and another 80 that market only our personal lines products, primarily ones with a high net worth focus.  
We continue to earn new business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. For full year 2018, each of our property casualty segments reported record levels of new business written premiums, and overall property casualty net written premiums grew 4%. 
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, our underwriters continued to generate overall price increases. Commercial lines estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter. Combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by a full percentage point for the year 2018 to 95.4%, despite the ratio for catastrophe losses increasing by 0.8 point. 
Our personal lines segment continued to experience a rise in average rate changes as the fourth quarter of 2018 was similar to the third quarter. Personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was profitable. While it was above 100% for the year 2018, it proved (sic) [ improved ] compared with year-end 2017 as we continued to work for performance improvement. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another year with excellent results, including double-digit growth in net written premiums and a 2018 combined ratio below 75%. Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned, but was adversely affected by catastrophe losses from severe weather and wildfires. It finished the year with a combined ratio of 105.8%, which is consistent with our expectations for a year with global insured catastrophe losses roughly twice the long-term historical average. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line, with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 13% and full year 2018 growth at 9%. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings, as it has less correlation to weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary and property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2019 are similar to 2018. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing. 
The full year 2018 value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, was negative 0.1%. The contribution from operating income was a positive 6.7%. The VCR in total was below our long-term target range due to the decline in securities market value. However, the VCR average for the past 5 years was within the target range. 
In conclusion, finishing the year well reflects areas of ongoing operational improvement. Despite the fourth quarter downturn in the stock market, the good performance of our insurance business was a key factor in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 5.7% increase in the regular cash dividend declared earlier this month. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several important points about our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led the way, up 9% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6% for the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio was flat for the year. The pretax average yield was 4.21% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 13 basis points from 2017's fourth quarter. We continued to invest in bonds including $347 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.48%, 60 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.69%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds throughout 2018. 
Our investment portfolio valuation was volatile for much of 2018 and on a full year basis, experienced an overall net loss of $741 million before tax effects. That included $395 million for our equity portfolio and $334 million for our bond portfolio. Even though those losses -- even with those losses, we ended the year with a net appreciated value of nearly $2.6 billion including $46 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows again exceeded $1 billion, and for full year 2018, exceeded the prior year by $129 million or 12%. 
I'll briefly comment on expense management, always an important part of our focus. While we continued to make thoughtful, strategic investments in our business, our full year 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.2 percentage points compared with the same period of 2017. 
Loss reserves are another important area, and our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years on both a fourth quarter and full year 2018 basis.
2018 marked our 30th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development. Full year 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points, matching the annual average during 2013 through 2017. Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $16 million of favorable reserve development during the fourth quarter -- during the quarter and $47 million for the year. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development in 2018. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 23% for accident year 2016, and 39% for 2015 and prior accident years. 
We continued to actively manage our capital, and both financial strength and flexibility remained excellent. This week, we concluded efforts to enhance our financial flexibility by amending and extending our line of credit agreement with various banks. The former agreement was due to expire in May. The term is for 5 years for up to $300 million, and the accordion feature allows us to double that amount under the same terms and conditions. Most of the other terms and conditions are similar to the former agreement, although our financial flexibility also improved, with the elimination of a minimum net worth covenant and the debt to total capital maximum is now 35%. 
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.52. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.17. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.70. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $3.12 during the fourth quarter to $48.10 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

This is Steve Johnston here, and I'll cover the reserve part. In terms of the releases, we have a very qualified actuarial department that uses some very sophisticated tools, particularly in the long-tail lines, such as workers' compensation. They're looking at trends and explicitly looking at inflation in terms of medical inflation, indemnity inflation, paid loss trends. And with all of the data that they look at, there's obviously a little bit of a cautious eye towards workers' compensation in that it's been a cyclical line over time. And that slight variation in actual results on some of the loss trend picks can have a large impact on the overall results, given the long-tail nature of the line. So they have taken I think a very prudent approach to reserving workers' comp. And yet as they look at the more recent accident years going back in terms of how the actual trends have come in versus what they've predicted, feel that it's prudent to release the reserves that they have. And it's a very consistent position that they take, a consistent philosophy that they go about the reserve setting. In terms of the market conditions, I'll turn it over to Steve Spray."

And I think no change has impacted our work comp results more than the things that we've done with claims, more expertise, a call center for timeliness of reporting, have just helped -- medical bill repricing have just really helped the results over the year. I will tell you -- or over the years. We are cautiously looking at the continued base rate declines that come out of NCCI and the impact that, that's having on the accident year results. You can see that in the reports. But something that we are going to continue to watch, we'll continue to be cautious with work comp, but we want to continue to grow it."

And we're getting obviously more than the average on the least adequately priced business, and less on the most adequately priced; really focused on retention on that adequately -- on that most adequately priced business.

But the underwriters, I think, are doing an excellent job of trying to mitigate that as much as possible. We still feel really good about the overall pricing of the book at this point in time although, again, those base rates are putting pressure. We're a package underwriter. So many times, when you write -- let me give you an example. If you're writing a package and you're not real high on the auto, you're probably going to lose the entire package. You're not going to have an opportunity at that. With workers' compensation, there's enough monoline markets out there that if that line of business is not attractive to us, we can still continue to write the package and that comp will end up going somewhere else. So it allows us to be I think more prudent and more conservative on the workers' compensation. So I think that covers it."

So as an example, our excess and surplus lines company, you can see how that's performing. High net worth -- Will Van Den Heuvel and the team that he's built and the growth that we've got there. We started the target markets division, which is really niche products and commercial lines in direct response to agents' needs and the fact that they were majoring in specific industries or class segments. We're up to 15 of those now. We've made extensive product improvements in management liability and surety, especially on the management liability front. That segment is growing rapidly and is very profitable. We stay out of the public company sector. It's primarily nonprofit, small privately held companies as well. So that's performed well. So it kind of just goes on and on. Now with our Lloyd's Syndicate, things that are always in direct -- again, it's always in direct response to the needs of our agents. We have -- another area that we are expanding is in commercial lines. And as we move upstream into larger, more complex risks for our agents, we feel like we have plenty of capacity. We just need to expand our expertise. We hired Chet Swisher about 2.5 years ago, came over to join us, had tremendous amount of large account experience and expertise. He's building out that unit to just be that much more important to our agents as well. So hopefully, I think that should cover what your question was, Paul."

So the worksite -- so when we're out there on the commercial lines side and getting the worksite, that was up 17.7% for the current year, and that's a first year. So it's -- just all around, it's been very good. It's rounded out the -- what our independent agents have in their toolbox for the insurers to be able to sell the insurance. From the annuity side, we just have fixed annuities. We don't do any variable annuities. So we think we do remain competitive there with the interest rates that we apply to those products. And we do look and adjust those quarterly to make sure that we are remaining competitive in that area. So overall, another -- I think a great year for the life company. Their non-GAAP operating income was $52 million this year compared to $40 million in the prior year. So with the premiums that are in there, the mortality was up a little higher than what we predicted at the beginning of the year. And then kind of rounding that out with some tax effects, we had a great year. So the life insurance company continues to be a valuable asset for us."

Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement",948,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter results. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities. Non-GAAP operating income improved for the quarter, and on a full year basis, it was 21% higher than 2017. 
We are encouraged by our 2018 financial results and continue to be confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it well. Improved operating performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 again reflected steady efforts to carefully underwriting price policies, provide outstanding claims service, manage investments and support our agencies. Our fourth quarter 93.9% combined ratio helped lower full year 2018 to 96.4%, 1.1 points better than 2017. Slightly more favorable catastrophe weather effects in 2018 contributed 0.1 point, while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures. 
We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis. That work is vital to our further improvement of underwriting results. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on the 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2019 GAAP combined ratio below 95%. We also believe our 2019 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2018. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
In 2018, we continued to manage our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for commercial lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. For personal lines, our policy retention during the second half of 2018 declined from recent year levels, reflecting increased underwriting discipline and was near the high end of the mid-80% range. 
Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value. In 2018, we appointed 167 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2019, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products, and another 80 that market only our personal lines products, primarily ones with a high net worth focus.  
We continue to earn new business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. For full year 2018, each of our property casualty segments reported record levels of new business written premiums, and overall property casualty net written premiums grew 4%. 
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, our underwriters continued to generate overall price increases. Commercial lines estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter. Combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by a full percentage point for the year 2018 to 95.4%, despite the ratio for catastrophe losses increasing by 0.8 point. 
Our personal lines segment continued to experience a rise in average rate changes as the fourth quarter of 2018 was similar to the third quarter. Personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was profitable. While it was above 100% for the year 2018, it proved (sic) [ improved ] compared with year-end 2017 as we continued to work for performance improvement. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another year with excellent results, including double-digit growth in net written premiums and a 2018 combined ratio below 75%. Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned, but was adversely affected by catastrophe losses from severe weather and wildfires. It finished the year with a combined ratio of 105.8%, which is consistent with our expectations for a year with global insured catastrophe losses roughly twice the long-term historical average. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line, with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 13% and full year 2018 growth at 9%. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings, as it has less correlation to weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary and property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2019 are similar to 2018. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing. 
The full year 2018 value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, was negative 0.1%. The contribution from operating income was a positive 6.7%. The VCR in total was below our long-term target range due to the decline in securities market value. However, the VCR average for the past 5 years was within the target range. 
In conclusion, finishing the year well reflects areas of ongoing operational improvement. Despite the fourth quarter downturn in the stock market, the good performance of our insurance business was a key factor in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 5.7% increase in the regular cash dividend declared earlier this month. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several important points about our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led the way, up 9% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6% for the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio was flat for the year. The pretax average yield was 4.21% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 13 basis points from 2017's fourth quarter. We continued to invest in bonds including $347 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.48%, 60 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.69%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds throughout 2018. 
Our investment portfolio valuation was volatile for much of 2018 and on a full year basis, experienced an overall net loss of $741 million before tax effects. That included $395 million for our equity portfolio and $334 million for our bond portfolio. Even though those losses -- even with those losses, we ended the year with a net appreciated value of nearly $2.6 billion including $46 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows again exceeded $1 billion, and for full year 2018, exceeded the prior year by $129 million or 12%. 
I'll briefly comment on expense management, always an important part of our focus. While we continued to make thoughtful, strategic investments in our business, our full year 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the same period of 2017. 
Loss reserves are another important area, and our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years on both a fourth quarter and full year 2018 basis.
2018 marked our 30th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development. Full year 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points, matching the annual average during 2013 through 2017. Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $16 million of favorable reserve development during the fourth quarter -- during the quarter and $47 million for the year. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development in 2018. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 23% for accident year 2016, and 39% for 2015 and prior accident years. 
We continued to actively manage our capital, and both financial strength and flexibility remained excellent. This week, we concluded efforts to enhance our financial flexibility by amending and extending our line of credit agreement with various banks. The former agreement was due to expire in May. The term is for 5 years for up to $300 million, and the accordion feature allows us to double that amount under the same terms and conditions. Most of the other terms and conditions are similar to the former agreement, although our financial flexibility also improved, with the elimination of a minimum net worth covenant and the debt to total capital maximum is now 35%. 
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.52. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.17. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.70. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $3.12 during the fourth quarter to $48.10 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

It was a good quarter and second half for the year 2018. We are bullish about the future of Cincinnati Financial. We see improving trends in several areas and look forward to meaningful contributions over time from leaders at Beaufort Underwriting Agency, the Lloyd's managing agency subsidiary of our pending acquisition of MSP Underwriting Ltd. That acquisition is still on track to close during the first quarter of 2019. 
We know our strategy works, and we'll continue to execute it as we target profitable growth, while providing great service to our appointed agencies. That should benefit all stakeholders of the company, creating shareholder value over time. 
Many of you know J.F. Scherer from his years of investor travel. He's announced his intent to retire in August after more than 35 years of service and leadership to our organization. This will likely be his final earnings call. J.F, would you like to say a few words?"

This is Steve Johnston here, and I'll cover the reserve part. In terms of the releases, we have a very qualified actuarial department that uses some very sophisticated tools, particularly in the long-tail lines, such as workers' compensation. They're looking at trends and explicitly looking at inflation in terms of medical inflation, indemnity inflation, paid loss trends. And with all of the data that they look at, there's obviously a little bit of a cautious eye towards workers' compensation in that it's been a cyclical line over time. And that slight variation in actual results on some of the loss trend picks can have a large impact on the overall results, given the long-tail nature of the line. So they have taken I think a very prudent approach to reserving workers' comp. And yet as they look at the more recent accident years going back in terms of how the actual trends have come in versus what they've predicted, feel that it's prudent to release the reserves that they have. And it's a very consistent position that they take, a consistent philosophy that they go about the reserve setting. In terms of the market conditions, I'll turn it over to Steve Spray."

Over the last several years, I think we've made really good strides on many different fronts in managing workers' compensation, risk selection, underwriting, pricing, the analytics that we've employed there, loss control. And I think no change has impacted our work comp results more than the things that we've done with claims, more expertise, a call center for timeliness of reporting, have just helped -- medical bill repricing have just really helped the results over the year. I will tell you -- or over the years. We are cautiously looking at the continued base rate declines that come out of NCCI and the impact that, that's having on the accident year results. You can see that in the reports. But something that we are going to continue to watch, we'll continue to be cautious with work comp, but we want to continue to grow it."

We think that there's still plenty of runway in '19 for that to continue, but those high single-digit increases don't really tell the full story. I think our underwriting teams with our agents -- in working closely with our agents, have really executed well on segmenting the book. And we're getting obviously more than the average on the least adequately priced business, and less on the most adequately priced; really focused on retention on that adequately -- on that most adequately priced business.

There's still macro issues that are going on in commercial auto that you've probably heard, distracted driving, driver shortages, policyholders having difficulty finding qualified individuals to put behind the wheel.

If I don't hit it, you obviously can give me a follow-up. The base rate declines are putting pressure on the growth. But the underwriters, I think, are doing an excellent job of trying to mitigate that as much as possible. We still feel really good about the overall pricing of the book at this point in time although, again, those base rates are putting pressure. We're a package underwriter. So many times, when you write -- let me give you an example. If you're writing a package and you're not real high on the auto, you're probably going to lose the entire package. You're not going to have an opportunity at that. With workers' compensation, there's enough monoline markets out there that if that line of business is not attractive to us, we can still continue to write the package and that comp will end up going somewhere else. So it allows us to be I think more prudent and more conservative on the workers' compensation. So I think that covers it."

So as an example, our excess and surplus lines company, you can see how that's performing. High net worth -- Will Van Den Heuvel and the team that he's built and the growth that we've got there. We started the target markets division, which is really niche products and commercial lines in direct response to agents' needs and the fact that they were majoring in specific industries or class segments. We're up to 15 of those now. We've made extensive product improvements in management liability and surety, especially on the management liability front. That segment is growing rapidly and is very profitable. We stay out of the public company sector. It's primarily nonprofit, small privately held companies as well. So that's performed well. So it kind of just goes on and on. Now with our Lloyd's Syndicate, things that are always in direct -- again, it's always in direct response to the needs of our agents. We have -- another area that we are expanding is in commercial lines. And as we move upstream into larger, more complex risks for our agents, we feel like we have plenty of capacity. We just need to expand our expertise. We hired Chet Swisher about 2.5 years ago, came over to join us, had tremendous amount of large account experience and expertise. He's building out that unit to just be that much more important to our agents as well. So hopefully, I think that should cover what your question was, Paul."

So the worksite -- so when we're out there on the commercial lines side and getting the worksite, that was up 17.7% for the current year, and that's a first year. So it's -- just all around, it's been very good. It's rounded out the -- what our independent agents have in their toolbox for the insurers to be able to sell the insurance. From the annuity side, we just have fixed annuities. We don't do any variable annuities. So we think we do remain competitive there with the interest rates that we apply to those products. And we do look and adjust those quarterly to make sure that we are remaining competitive in that area. So overall, another -- I think a great year for the life company. Their non-GAAP operating income was $52 million this year compared to $40 million in the prior year. So with the premiums that are in there, the mortality was up a little higher than what we predicted at the beginning of the year.

Non-GAAP operating income improved for the quarter, and on a full year basis, it was 21% higher than 2017. 
We are encouraged by our 2018 financial results and continue to be confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it well. Improved operating performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 again reflected steady efforts to carefully underwriting price policies, provide outstanding claims service, manage investments and support our agencies. Our fourth quarter 93.9% combined ratio helped lower full year 2018 to 96.4%, 1.1 points better than 2017. Slightly more favorable catastrophe weather effects in 2018 contributed 0.1 point, while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures. 
We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis. That work is vital to our further improvement of underwriting results. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on the 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2019 GAAP combined ratio below 95%. We also believe our 2019 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2018. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
In 2018, we continued to manage our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for commercial lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. For personal lines, our policy retention during the second half of 2018 declined from recent year levels, reflecting increased underwriting discipline and was near the high end of the mid-80% range. 
Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value. In 2018, we appointed 167 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2019, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products, and another 80 that market only our personal lines products, primarily ones with a high net worth focus. 
We continue to earn new business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. For full year 2018, each of our property casualty segments reported record levels of new business written premiums, and overall property casualty net written premiums grew 4%. 
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, our underwriters continued to generate overall price increases. Commercial lines estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter. Combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by a full percentage point for the year 2018 to 95.4%, despite the ratio for catastrophe losses increasing by 0.8 point. 
Our personal lines segment continued to experience a rise in average rate changes as the fourth quarter of 2018 was similar to the third quarter. Personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was profitable. While it was above 100% for the year 2018, it proved (sic) [ improved ] compared with year-end 2017 as we continued to work for performance improvement. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another year with excellent results, including double-digit growth in net written premiums and a 2018 combined ratio below 75%. Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned, but was adversely affected by catastrophe losses from severe weather and wildfires. It finished the year with a combined ratio of 105.8%, which is consistent with our expectations for a year with global insured catastrophe losses roughly twice the long-term historical average. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line, with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 13% and full year 2018 growth at 9%. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings, as it has less correlation to weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary and property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2019 are similar to 2018. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing. 
The full year 2018 value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, was negative 0.1%. The contribution from operating income was a positive 6.7%. The VCR in total was below our long-term target range due to the decline in securities market value. However, the VCR average for the past 5 years was within the target range. 
In conclusion, finishing the year well reflects areas of ongoing operational improvement. Despite the fourth quarter downturn in the stock market, the good performance of our insurance business was a key factor in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 5.7% increase in the regular cash dividend declared earlier this month. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several important points about our financial performance."

Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led t",682,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led the way, up 9% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6% for the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio was flat for the year. The pretax average yield was 4.21% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 13 basis points from 2017's fourth quarter. We continued to invest in bonds including $347 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.48%, 60 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.69%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds throughout 2018. 
Our investment portfolio valuation was volatile for much of 2018 and on a full year basis, experienced an overall net loss of $741 million before tax effects. That included $395 million for our equity portfolio and $334 million for our bond portfolio. Even though those losses -- even with those losses, we ended the year with a net appreciated value of nearly $2.6 billion including $46 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows again exceeded $1 billion, and for full year 2018, exceeded the prior year by $129 million or 12%. 
I'll briefly comment on expense management, always an important part of our focus. While we continued to make thoughtful, strategic investments in our business, our full year 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the same period of 2017. 
Loss reserves are another important area, and our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years on both a fourth quarter and full year 2018 basis.
2018 marked our 30th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development. Full year 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points, matching the annual average during 2013 through 2017. Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $16 million of favorable reserve development during the fourth quarter -- during the quarter and $47 million for the year. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development in 2018. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 23% for accident year 2016, and 39% for 2015 and prior accident years. 
We continued to actively manage our capital, and both financial strength and flexibility remained excellent. This week, we concluded efforts to enhance our financial flexibility by amending and extending our line of credit agreement with various banks. The former agreement was due to expire in May. The term is for 5 years for up to $300 million, and the accordion feature allows us to double that amount under the same terms and conditions. Most of the other terms and conditions are similar to the former agreement, although our financial flexibility also improved, with the elimination of a minimum net worth covenant and the debt to total capital maximum is now 35%. 
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.52. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.17. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.70. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $3.12 during the fourth quarter to $48.10 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

This is Steve Johnston here, and I'll cover the reserve part. In terms of the releases, we have a very qualified actuarial department that uses some very sophisticated tools, particularly in the long-tail lines, such as workers' compensation. They're looking at trends and explicitly looking at inflation in terms of medical inflation, indemnity inflation, paid loss trends. And with all of the data that they look at, there's obviously a little bit of a cautious eye towards workers' compensation in that it's been a cyclical line over time. And that slight variation in actual results on some of the loss trend picks can have a large impact on the overall results, given the long-tail nature of the line. So they have taken I think a very prudent approach to reserving workers' comp. And yet as they look at the more recent accident years going back in terms of how the actual trends have come in versus what they've predicted, feel that it's prudent to release the reserves that they have. And it's a very consistent position that they take, a consistent philosophy that they go about the reserve setting. In terms of the market conditions, I'll turn it over to Steve Spray."

Over the last several years, I think we've made really good strides on many different fronts in managing workers' compensation, risk selection, underwriting, pricing, the analytics that we've employed there, loss control. And I think no change has impacted our work comp results more than the things that we've done with claims, more expertise, a call center for timeliness of reporting, have just helped -- medical bill repricing have just really helped the results over the year. I will tell you -- or over the years. We are cautiously looking at the continued base rate declines that come out of NCCI and the impact that, that's having on the accident year results. You can see that in the reports. But something that we are going to continue to watch, we'll continue to be cautious with work comp, but we want to continue to grow it."

And one thing I'd point out is we continue to earn in really solid, high single-digit rate increases throughout 2018. We think that there's still plenty of runway in '19 for that to continue, but those high single-digit increases don't really tell the full story. I think our underwriting teams with our agents -- in working closely with our agents, have really executed well on segmenting the book. And we're getting obviously more than the average on the least adequately priced business, and less on the most adequately priced; really focused on retention on that adequately -- on that most adequately priced business. So still plenty of runway. There's still macro issues that are going on in commercial auto that you've probably heard, distracted driving, driver shortages, policyholders having difficulty finding qualified individuals to put behind the wheel. It's all having an effect on commercial auto."

And when I look at premium rates -- sorry, your premium volumes there, they've been, second half of the year, down kind of close to double digits. Is that mostly just pricing and policies are flattish? Or are you guys expecting to kind of grow premium levels in 2019, because maybe pricing is getting less negative? I'm just trying to understand the dynamic there on workers' comp growth for '19."

If I don't hit it, you obviously can give me a follow-up. The base rate declines are putting pressure on the growth. But the underwriters, I think, are doing an excellent job of trying to mitigate that as much as possible. We still feel really good about the overall pricing of the book at this point in time although, again, those base rates are putting pressure. We're a package underwriter. So many times, when you write -- let me give you an example. If you're writing a package and you're not real high on the auto, you're probably going to lose the entire package. You're not going to have an opportunity at that. With workers' compensation, there's enough monoline markets out there that if that line of business is not attractive to us, we can still continue to write the package and that comp will end up going somewhere else. So it allows us to be I think more prudent and more conservative on the workers' compensation. So I think that covers it."

We've always been a company, as you know, that has built -- built around our distribution. And anything we do in here, as far as expanding products and services, is in direct reflection of what the agents' desires are of us. So as an example, our excess and surplus lines company, you can see how that's performing. High net worth -- Will Van Den Heuvel and the team that he's built and the growth that we've got there. We started the target markets division, which is really niche products and commercial lines in direct response to agents' needs and the fact that they were majoring in specific industries or class segments. We're up to 15 of those now. We've made extensive product improvements in management liability and surety, especially on the management liability front. That segment is growing rapidly and is very profitable. We stay out of the public company sector. It's primarily nonprofit, small privately held companies as well. So that's performed well. So it kind of just goes on and on. Now with our Lloyd's Syndicate, things that are always in direct -- again, it's always in direct response to the needs of our agents. We have -- another area that we are expanding is in commercial lines. And as we move upstream into larger, more complex risks for our agents, we feel like we have plenty of capacity. We just need to expand our expertise. We hired Chet Swisher about 2.5 years ago, came over to join us, had tremendous amount of large account experience and expertise. He's building out that unit to just be that much more important to our agents as well. So hopefully, I think that should cover what your question was, Paul."

Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement",948,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter results. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2018 represent a strong finish, despite reporting a net loss of $452 million because of the accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities. Non-GAAP operating income improved for the quarter, and on a full year basis, it was 21% higher than 2017. 
We are encouraged by our 2018 financial results and continue to be confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it well. Improved operating performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 again reflected steady efforts to carefully underwriting price policies, provide outstanding claims service, manage investments and support our agencies. Our fourth quarter 93.9% combined ratio helped lower full year 2018 to 96.4%, 1.1 points better than 2017. Slightly more favorable catastrophe weather effects in 2018 contributed 0.1 point, while improved underwriting was reflected in various underlying measures. 
We continue to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities using pricing precision and risk selection decisions that combine data models and underwriter expertise on a policy-by-policy basis. That work is vital to our further improvement of underwriting results. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve on the 2018 combined ratio before catastrophe effects for a 2019 GAAP combined ratio below 95%. We also believe our 2019 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2018. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. 
In 2018, we continued to manage our business to healthy levels of policy retention and with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. Policy retention rates for commercial lines were similar to a year ago, continuing near the high end of the mid-80% range. For personal lines, our policy retention during the second half of 2018 declined from recent year levels, reflecting increased underwriting discipline and was near the high end of the mid-80% range. 
Our long-term growth strategy includes appointing agencies in areas where we are underrepresented, taking care to preserve relationships with established agencies and the franchise-like benefit they value. In 2018, we appointed 167 new independent agencies. Similar to recent years, in 2019, we plan to appoint approximately 100 additional agencies that will offer most or all of our property casualty insurance products, and another 80 that market only our personal lines products, primarily ones with a high net worth focus. 
We continue to earn new business through our agencies from a combination of superior service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. For full year 2018, each of our property casualty segments reported record levels of new business written premiums, and overall property casualty net written premiums grew 4%. 
For renewal business in the fourth quarter, our underwriters continued to generate overall price increases. Commercial lines estimated average price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter. Combined ratio for our commercial lines segment improved by a full percentage point for the year 2018 to 95.4%, despite the ratio for catastrophe losses increasing by 0.8 point. 
Our personal lines segment continued to experience a rise in average rate changes as the fourth quarter of 2018 was similar to the third quarter. Personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was profitable. While it was above 100% for the year 2018, it proved (sic) [ improved ] compared with year-end 2017 as we continued to work for performance improvement. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another year with excellent results, including double-digit growth in net written premiums and a 2018 combined ratio below 75%. Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned, but was adversely affected by catastrophe losses from severe weather and wildfires. It finished the year with a combined ratio of 105.8%, which is consistent with our expectations for a year with global insured catastrophe losses roughly twice the long-term historical average. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, its largest product line, with fourth quarter earned premium growth of 13% and full year 2018 growth at 9%. This business supports account retention for our agents and provides steady contributions to our earnings, as it has less correlation to weather than our property casualty business. 
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary and property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions for 2019 are similar to 2018. While we did receive some modest rate reductions, we expect the amount of seasoned premiums for both years to be similar because our direct written premiums subject to those treaties are growing. 
The full year 2018 value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, was negative 0.1%. The contribution from operating income was a positive 6.7%. The VCR in total was below our long-term target range due to the decline in securities market value. However, the VCR average for the past 5 years was within the target range. 
In conclusion, finishing the year well reflects areas of ongoing operational improvement. Despite the fourth quarter downturn in the stock market, the good performance of our insurance business was a key factor in the recent decision by our Board of Directors to reward shareholders with a 5.7% increase in the regular cash dividend declared earlier this month. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several important points about our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2018, matching the full year 2017 growth rate. Dividends from our equity portfolio again led the way, up 9% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6% for the year. 
Interest income from our bond portfolio was flat for the year. The pretax average yield was 4.21% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 13 basis points from 2017's fourth quarter. We continued to invest in bonds including $347 million in net purchases for the year. Taxable bonds purchased during 2018 had an average pretax yield of 4.48%, 60 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.69%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds throughout 2018. 
Our investment portfolio valuation was volatile for much of 2018 and on a full year basis, experienced an overall net loss of $741 million before tax effects. That included $395 million for our equity portfolio and $334 million for our bond portfolio. Even though those losses -- even with those losses, we ended the year with a net appreciated value of nearly $2.6 billion including $46 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities continues to help us grow investment income. Funds generated from net operating cash flows again exceeded $1 billion, and for full year 2018, exceeded the prior year by $129 million or 12%. 
I'll briefly comment on expense management, always an important part of our focus. While we continued to make thoughtful, strategic investments in our business, our full year 2018 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the same period of 2017. 
Loss reserves are another important area, and our consistent approach to setting overall reserves again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years on both a fourth quarter and full year 2018 basis.
2018 marked our 30th consecutive year of net favorable reserve development. Full year 2018 favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points, matching the annual average during 2013 through 2017. Our commercial casualty line of business experienced $16 million of favorable reserve development during the fourth quarter -- during the quarter and $47 million for the year. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development in 2018. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 38% for accident year 2017, 23% for accident year 2016, and 39% for 2015 and prior accident years. 
We continued to actively manage our capital, and both financial strength and flexibility remained excellent. This week, we concluded efforts to enhance our financial flexibility by amending and extending our line of credit agreement with various banks. The former agreement was due to expire in May. The term is for 5 years for up to $300 million, and the accordion feature allows us to double that amount under the same terms and conditions. Most of the other terms and conditions are similar to the former agreement, although our financial flexibility also improved, with the elimination of a minimum net worth covenant and the debt to total capital maximum is now 35%. 
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with the usual summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.38. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.52. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.17. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.70. And we declared $0.53 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $3.12 during the fourth quarter to $48.10 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

This is Steve Johnston here, and I'll cover the reserve part. In terms of the releases, we have a very qualified actuarial department that uses some very sophisticated tools, particularly in the long-tail lines, such as workers' compensation. They're looking at trends and explicitly looking at inflation in terms of medical inflation, indemnity inflation, paid loss trends. And with all of the data that they look at, there's obviously a little bit of a cautious eye towards workers' compensation in that it's been a cyclical line over time. And that slight variation in actual results on some of the loss trend picks can have a large impact on the overall results, given the long-tail nature of the line. So they have taken I think a very prudent approach to reserving workers' comp. And yet as they look at the more recent accident years going back in terms of how the actual trends have come in versus what they've predicted, feel that it's prudent to release the reserves that they have.

We don't write monoline work comp. The results have been good. We feel good about the growth of it in the future and our appetite for it. Over the last several years, I think we've made really good strides on many different fronts in managing workers' compensation, risk selection, underwriting, pricing, the analytics that we've employed there, loss control. And I think no change has impacted our work comp results more than the things that we've done with claims, more expertise, a call center for timeliness of reporting, have just helped -- medical bill repricing have just really helped the results over the year. I will tell you -- or over the years. We are cautiously looking at the continued base rate declines that come out of NCCI and the impact that, that's having on the accident year results. You can see that in the reports. But something that we are going to continue to watch, we'll continue to be cautious with work comp, but we want to continue to grow it."

We think that there's still plenty of runway in '19 for that to continue, but those high single-digit increases don't really tell the full story. I think our underwriting teams with our agents -- in working closely with our agents, have really executed well on segmenting the book. And we're getting obviously more than the average on the least adequately priced business, and less on the most adequately priced; really focused on retention on that adequately -- on that most adequately priced business. So still plenty of runway. There's still macro issues that are going on in commercial auto that you've probably heard, distracted driving, driver shortages, policyholders having difficulty finding qualified individuals to put behind the wheel. It's all having an effect on commercial auto."

If I don't hit it, you obviously can give me a follow-up. The base rate declines are putting pressure on the growth. But the underwriters, I think, are doing an excellent job of trying to mitigate that as much as possible. We still feel really good about the overall pricing of the book at this point in time although, again, those base rates are putting pressure. We're a package underwriter. So many times, when you write -- let me give you an example. If you're writing a package and you're not real high on the auto, you're probably going to lose the entire package. You're not going to have an opportunity at that. With workers' compensation, there's enough monoline markets out there that if that line of business is not attractive to us, we can still continue to write the package and that comp will end up going somewhere else. So it allows us to be I think more prudent and more conservative on the workers' compensation. So I think that covers it."

So as an example, our excess and surplus lines company, you can see how that's performing. High net worth -- Will Van Den Heuvel and the team that he's built and the growth that we've got there. We started the target markets division, which is really niche products and commercial lines in direct response to agents' needs and the fact that they were majoring in specific industries or class segments. We're up to 15 of those now. We've made extensive product improvements in management liability and surety, especially on the management liability front. That segment is growing rapidly and is very profitable. We stay out of the public company sector. It's primarily nonprofit, small privately held companies as well. So that's performed well. So it kind of just goes on and on. Now with our Lloyd's Syndicate, things that are always in direct -- again, it's always in direct response to the needs of our agents. We have -- another area that we are expanding is in commercial lines. And as we move upstream into larger, more complex risks for our agents, we feel like we have plenty of capacity. We just need to expand our expertise. We hired Chet Swisher about 2.5 years ago, came over to join us, had tremendous amount of large account experience and expertise. He's building out that unit to just be that much more important to our agents as well. So hopefully, I think that should cover what your question was, Paul."

So the worksite -- so when we're out there on the commercial lines side and getting the worksite, that was up 17.7% for the current year, and that's a first year. So it's -- just all around, it's been very good. It's rounded out the -- what our independent agents have in their toolbox for the insurers to be able to sell the insurance. From the annuity side, we just have fixed annuities. We don't do any variable annuities. So we think we do remain competitive there with the interest rates that we apply to those products. And we do look and adjust those quarterly to make sure that we are remaining competitive in that area. So overall, another -- I think a great year for the life company. Their non-GAAP operating income was $52 million this year compared to $40 million in the prior year. So with the premiums that are in there, the mortality was up a little higher than what we predicted at the beginning of the year. And then kind of rounding that out with some tax effects, we had a great year. So the life insurance company continues to be a valuable asset for us."

And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating performance was quite good, and we believe it reflects our prudent strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term. 
Net income for the first quarter of 2019 was up $726 million from a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities still held accounted for $672 million of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income, which we believe is a better indicator of short-term core operating performance, also improved significantly, up 43%. Our 93.0% property casualty combined ratio was 4.9 percentage points better than the year ago. Slightly worse catastrophe weather effects in 2019 had an unfavorable effect of 1.4 points, while improved underwriting was indicated by several underlying measures. 
The first quarter again demonstrated experienced management in pricing individual policies, which -- with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That, along with excellent service, helped us to again earn more business through our agencies, contributing to 10% growth in net written premiums, with healthy amounts of new business written premiums. 
The Commercial Lines segment had first quarter [ 2009 ] estimated average price increases that were similar to the low to single-digit percentage increases of the fourth quarter. That segment's 90.8% combined ratio improved by 7.5 percentage points, while the ratio for catastrophe losses was slightly worse than last year's first quarter. Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases in the high single-digit range as the first quarter was similar to the fourth quarter. The personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was challenged by severe weather. The combined ratio remained a little above 100% as the ratio for catastrophe losses was 4.4 points higher than a year ago. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter, including double-digit growth in net written premium and a 2019 combined ratio of 83.5%. 
Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned and contributed nicely to underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low [ 90s ] Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, with first quarter up 10% on an earned. It's contribution to net income was down by $3 million primarily due to less favorable FX from the unlocking of actually assumptions and a net investment loss of approximately $1 million. 
Results for the first quarter also included the month of March for our recently acquired global specialty underwriter and Lloyd's integrated vehicle, MSP Underwriting. We closed the transaction at the end of February with a payment of $64 million, which represents a multiple of 1.9x book value as of the closing. 
MSP contributed $21 million to our first quarter net written premiums and generated an underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low [ 50s ] lower than typical, in part due to favorable aspects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
We remain confident in future prospects towards profitable growth and plan to implement a new name next week for better alignment with Cincinnati's brand and highly regarded reputation. I conclude with the value creation ratio. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. It was very good for the first quarter at 11.1%. The contribution of net income before investment gains was 2.2% and a strong stock market in the early part of the year helped boost the contribution of investment gains to 9.1%. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other key areas of our financial performance."

I",607,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth was very strong, up 5% for the first quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 10%, a result of dividend rates rising from many of our holdings. Interest income from our bond portfolio was up 1%. The pretax average yield was 4.15% for the first quarter, down 11 basis points from the first quarter a year ago. We continue to invest in bonds, including [ $19 ] million in net purchases during the quarter. 
Taxable bonds purchased had an average pretax yield of 4.99%, 88 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.52%, up 20 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds. Our investment portfolio valuation again experienced volatility from security market trends, but for the first quarter of 2019, that was favorable for both our stock and our bond portfolios. 
The overall net gain was $905 million before tax effects. That included $656 million from our equity portfolio and $244 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.5 billion, including $288 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities generated $200 million, up 30%, again fueling investment income. Speaking of healthy cash flow, that helped to pay for the MSP acquisition without additional borrowing. Also remember, the acquisition can be characterized as bolt-on in nature. Much of the integration work relates to financial processes and it's proceeding well. As we previously disclosed, for the foreseeable future, we plan to report MSP results as part of other, along with Cincinnati Re. 
Turning to expense management. We continue to invest in our business strategically, while working to avoid wasteful spending. The first quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 1.2 percentage points compared with the 2018 period and was basically in line with the full year 2018 ratio. 
Regarding loss reserves. Our approach remains consistent and again resulted in property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the first quarter of 2019 benefit our combined ratio by 5.3 percentage points, with our commercial lines segment driving a more favorable result compared with a year ago. For commercial casualty, our largest lines of business, we experienced $31 million of favorable reserve development representing nearly half of the property casualty total. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the quarter. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 24% for accident year 2018, 33% for accident year 2017 and 43% for 2016 and prior accident years. 
As for capital management. We've proven to be steady over the long term. Our financial strength remains in excellent shape with plenty of financial flexibility. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.44. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.18. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $3.18. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.78 during the first quarter to a record high $52.88 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve"

We are moving up with expertise and specialization in some larger commercial lines risks, and that would be -- we would identify that as in excess of [ $250,000 ] in premium just to give you an idea because some national carriers would consider that more middle market. As far as rate increases go, we have noticed a change in the marketplace, noticeable change, since January 1. It's kind of hard candidly to put our finger on exactly where all that is coming from, and I think it's going to continue to evolve. We are certainly seeing commercial auto continue to firm. And as an example, surplus lines traditionally has always been a leading indicator for affirming market, and the number of submissions that are being sent to our E&S subsidiaries, CSU, are up substantially. And there are some traditional classes that kind of float in and out of standard markets and surplus lines market. As an example, habitational risks that they're seeing. But the majority of what they're seeing is kind of validating what I'm saying as far as auto. They're seeing a lot of excess liability, capacity issues in the marketplace for heavy fleets and such. So long-winded answer, but I think that the commercial auto marketplace is still firming. I think that -- I believe that are out in front of it by taking the action we took. And I also think one thing to pay attention, we talked about it last quarter, pay special attention to the average rate increases that are announced. I think the rising tide raising all boats of the past is certainly not the future of Cincinnati Insurance company. We are really focused on executing on segmentation.

As far as the growth, personal lines is, rightfully so, under little bit of pressure to the written premium growth. They are taking prudent, deliberate underwriting action, both underwriting and pricing action, across the country and really focusing on some specific states that need maybe a little stronger action than others. Michigan would be an example. Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, those are just 4 that come to mind, where they're really taking strong underwriting and rate action. And it is putting, those are larger states for us, and it is putting some pressure on the growth as well. But we continue to write new business.

So the -- for the commercial casualty, yes, it was about $31 million. So it was approaching half of the total favorable development for the quarter.

There was about $9 million from accident year '18, $8 million in accident year '17, $1 million, '16 and then $13 million favorable development for the prior years to '16. Generally speaking, as you know, and I've said on these calls before, we have a consistent approach in what we do and setting the reserves. We've got the same actuary folks who are setting those reserves so we haven't had any change over in that area. We don't know how paid losses will actually occur. We're watching that come in quarter-to-quarter, plus other factors that the actual folks will think of. So paid loss or paid losses, cost trends have been improving. If you look back at Footnote 4 from our 10-K, even in the first quarter, our case incurred has improved. So in the supplement that we also put out on Page 10, it gives kind of a little bit of a preview there, but you'll see our case incurred is down about 20% versus the average per quarter for 2018. So at this point, let's see how the reserves develop, and we're going to follow our actuaries' consistent process in setting reserves."

And basically, even though we disclosed everything, I didn't want the market to be surprised by thinking that we had this flash cover in place when we different. Through the modeling, so working on being cognizant of not writing reinsurance where we are exposed on the primary side, we think that the lack of correlation there works in our favor. But just the same, we wanted to get some clash cover. So the Section A of the contract that we bought last July 1 provided $50 million of coverage excess of $125 million, where we might have a loss that would come in from both parties.

But then really, almost everything else is going to be a 21%. So depending on the size of operating income compared to investment income, that's going to fluctuate in between there. So maybe if you put in a blended rate of about 17%, 18% effective tax rate, you'll probably get close on a long-term basis. I will probably also say that for MSP, their effective tax rate might be just -- might be around 21% but because of the size of it and the way that, that will fluctuate, it probably will not have a significant impact on your overall estimate for an effective tax rate."

First, we had an estimate of what we thought we would pay, which was about GBP 102 million that we had disclosed that back in October. It really then, when you came to closing, which was at the end of February, a lot of those adjustments come with what's the net asset value or the estimated net asset value at that point? And then you add on the implied premium that we were paying for the organization. So there we -- when we did close, we paid $64 million for the closing. We have paid an extra $35 million in extra funds at Lloyd's. So that's extra capital. Had Munich put that in before we closed, we would have been closer to the GBP 102 million that we originally disclosed. Thinking about, once you think that, you revalue your assets and the liabilities assumed, you have to look at the intangibles then. To follow from that, goodwill. There's a couple of things I do, or at least [ 1 ] item that gets written off, deferred acquisition costs, that comes off. That doesn't continue on so that gets written on. We did have to relook at the deferred tax assets under U.S. GAAP. How much of that can be realized or you set up a valuation allowance against that, which we did do. And then you add on the premium. So when you add all that together, we really, at least right now, we're estimating that we've got about $82 million of intangibles and goodwill that will be on our books subject to further adjustments that can and will occur over the next quarter or 2. If I'm thinking about the goodwill, that probably will make up maybe about, I'm going to say 1/3 of the intangibles in goodwill. We'll have some syndicate capacity, distribution relationships, the value in force. So some of those will be amortized. Some of those will not be amortized. So when you don't have deferred acquisition costs being amortized, being replaced with a little bit of intangibles, you're going to pick up some benefit there, at least during the first 4 quarters, I'll say. That's probably more than you wanted to hear, but it's a very complicated question that accountants love to answer."

We have, and I think we've talked about this in some past calls, but as we start up in any new operation and we look at how to set the reserves without a lot of actual experience for the E&S company, we look to industry, we look to Cincinnati Insurance, which we're generally right, similar risks at higher limits, and we use judgment, different methodologies. And over time, as we gather more actual data for the E&S company, we start to blend that actual CSU data into the computation and estimation of the reserves. And that is what is driving what you're seeing in terms of we're seeing favorable development for the E&S company. So what we're focusing on, and I think where you'll see more consistency, is in that ex-CAT accident year number and combined ratio that's been running in the low to [ mid-80s ] that we feel very good about that position and the consistency there and the strong performance of CSU, both in growth and profitability.

Good question. Yes, Our value prop for CSU is multifaceted. First and foremost, at the time when we formed the company, that carrier takes the risk, we also formed a brokerage because you have to have a brokerage involved in the E&S business take care of surplus lines, tax and all the compliance and goes with a nonadmitted carrier. So the key with that is that only licensed and appointed contracted agents of Cincinnati Insurance Company have access to our E&S company. We do not go through wholesalers, MGAs, MGUs. It's only appointed agents of Cincinnati Insurance company that in effect have direct access to our brokerage to our E&S company. Another big factor is that I think you might know that our profit sharing, we've been stacking up against anybody in the industry. We include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the agents' profit-sharing calculations are we sure and the profitability of that business with them. I'd like to think we can run the E&S operation leaner than what the marketplace does because we don't have so many cogs in the wheel. And so what we do is we return more of that to the agent we pay 15% commission up front to the agencies, which in many cases, might be double what they would get in a traditional E&S placement. I think most importantly, beyond the compensation is our E&S company, many E&S risks are well-managed, good people in the community. They just happen to be in a tough class of business. And when our agents know that our local claims rep that has a relationship with them it is assigned to the agency is also going to handle the E&S claims, that's a big, big deal. Because in many cases, those E&S clients, in the other markets, would be sent out to a third-party. Them handle it just fine but our agents know exactly what they're going to get from our local claims rep. And it gives them a peace of mind. They also have access to all resources of Cincinnati Insurance Company, whether it's loss control, claims, premium audit. We've now introduced, about a year ago, 18 months ago, direct bill in our E&S, which is unique, that's attractive for our agents and for policyholders as well. So we think, again long-winded, we think we've got a really differentiating value proposition in E&S and think that we are just scratching the surface inside our own agencies today. Our E&S business is approximately $275 million, and we've identified that our agencies that we do business with write about $3.5 billion in the market. So our runway to write more business inside our agencies is, as you can see, is really strong."

And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating performance was quite good, and we believe it reflects our prudent strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term. 
Net income for the first quarter of 2019 was up $726 million from a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities still held accounted for $672 million of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income, which we believe is a better indicator of short-term core operating performance, also improved significantly, up 43%. Our 93.0% property casualty combined ratio was 4.9 percentage points better than the year ago. Slightly worse catastrophe, weather effects in 2019, had an unfavorable effect of 1.4 points, while improved underwriting was indicated by several underlying measures. 
The first quarter again demonstrated experienced management in pricing individual policies, which -- with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That, along with excellent service, helped us to again earn more business through our agencies, contributing to 10% growth in net written premiums with healthy amounts of new business written premiums. 
The Commercial Lines segment had first quarter 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ]estimated average price increases that were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the fourth quarter. That segment's 90.8% combined ratio improved by 7.5 percentage points, while the ratio for catastrophe losses was slightly worse than last year's first quarter. Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases in the high single-digit range as the first quarter was similar to the fourth quarter. The personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was challenged by severe weather. The combined ratio remained a little above 100% as the ratio for catastrophe losses was 4.4 points higher than a year ago.
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter, including double-digit growth in net written premium and a 2019 combined ratio of 83.5%. 
Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned and contributed nicely to underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low 90s. Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, with first quarter up 10% on an earned basis. It's contribution to net income was down by $3 million primarily due to less favorable FX from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions and a net investment loss of approximately $1 million. 
Results for the first quarter also included the month of March for our recently acquired global specialty underwriter and Lloyd's integrated vehicle, MSP Underwriting. We closed the transaction at the end of February with a payment of $64 million, which represents a multiple of 1.9x book value as of the closing. 
MSP contributed $21 million to our first quarter net written premiums and generated an underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low 50s, lower than typical, in part due to favorable aspects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
We remain confident in future prospects for its profitable growth and plan to implement a new name next week for better alignment with Cincinnati's brand and highly regarded reputation. 
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. It was very good for the first quarter at 11.1%. The contribution of net income before investment gains was 2.2% and a strong stock market in the early part of the year helped boost the contribution of investment gains to 9.1%. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, who'll comment on other key areas of our financial performance."

Investment income growth was very strong, up 5% for the first quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 10%, a result of dividend rates rising for many of our holdings. In",601,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth was very strong, up 5% for the first quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 10%, a result of dividend rates rising for many of our holdings. Interest income from our bond portfolio was up 1%. The pretax average yield was 4.15% for the first quarter, down 11 basis points from the first quarter a year ago. We continue to invest in bonds, including $19 million in net purchases during the quarter. 
Taxable bonds purchased had an average pretax yield of 4.99%, 88 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.52%, up 20 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds. Our investment portfolio valuation again experienced volatility from security market trends. But for the first quarter of 2019, that was favorable for both our stock and our bond portfolios. 
The overall net gain was $905 million before tax effects. That included $656 million from our equity portfolio and $244 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.5 billion, including $288 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities generated $200 million, up 30%, again, fueling investment income. Speaking of healthy cash flow, that helped to pay for the MSP acquisition without additional borrowing. Also remember, the acquisition can be characterized as bolt-on in nature. Much of the integration work relates to financial processes, and it's proceeding well. As we previously disclosed, for the foreseeable future, we plan to report MSP results as part of other, along with Cincinnati Re. 
Turning to expense management. We continue to invest in our business strategically, while working to avoid wasteful spending. The first quarter 2019 property-casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 1.2 percentage points compared with the 2018 period, and it was basically in line with the full year 2018 ratio. 
Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and again resulted in property-casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the first quarter of 2019 benefit our combined ratio by 5.3 percentage points with our commercial lines segment driving the more favorable result compared with a year ago. 
For commercial casualty, our largest lines of business, we experienced $31 million of favorable reserve development representing nearly half of the property-casualty total. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the quarter. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 24% for accident year 2018, 33% for accident year 2017 and 43% for 2016 and prior accident years. As for capital management, we've proven to be steady over the long term. Our financial strength remains in excellent shape with plenty of financial flexibility. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.44. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.18. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $3.18. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.78 during the first quarter to a record-high $52.88 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve"

This is Steve Spray. Fortune 1000, that would not be a target for us. We are moving up with expertise and specialization in some larger commercial lines risks, and that would be -- we would identify that as in excess of $250,000 in premium just to give you an idea because some national carriers would consider that more middle market. 
As far as rate increases go, we have noticed a change in the marketplace, a noticeable change, since January 1. It's kind of hard candidly to put our finger on exactly where all that is coming from, and I think it's going to continue to evolve. We are certainly seeing commercial auto continue to firm. And as an example, surplus lines traditionally has always been a leading indicator for affirming market, and the number of submissions that are being sent to our E&S subsidiaries, CSU, are up substantially. And there are some traditional classes that kind of float in and out of standard markets and surplus lines market, as an example, habitational risks that they're seeing. But the majority of what they're seeing is kind of validating what I'm saying as far as auto. They're seeing a lot of excess liability, capacity issues in the marketplace for heavy fleet and such. 
So long-winded answer, but I think that the commercial auto marketplace is still firming. I think that -- I believe that we're out in front of it by taking the action we took. And I also think one thing to pay attention, we talked about it last quarter, pay special attention to the average rate increases that are announced. I think the rising tide raising all boats of the past is, it's certainly not the future of Cincinnati Insurance company. We are really focused on executing on segmentation. So while you might see an average rate increase that we have disclosed, that certainly doesn't tell the full story of how we are executing with our agents at the ground floor. 
We are segmenting the book, in that, really attacking the most inadequately portion of our book -- adequately priced portion of our book and doing all we can to retain the most adequately portion of the book and at that price."

As far as the growth, personal lines is, rightfully so, under a little bit of pressure to the written premium growth. They are taking prudent, deliberate underwriting action, both underwriting and pricing action, across the country and really focusing on some specific states that need maybe a little stronger action than others. Michigan would be an example. Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, those are just 4 that come to mind where they're really taking strong underwriting and rate action. And it is putting -- those are larger states for us, and it's putting some pressure on the growth as well. 
But we continue to write new business. As you can see, we do continue to appoint new agencies. A lot of those do tend to have a high net worth focus on the personal lines only. But there is committed to the middle market and getting it profitable as well."

There was about $9 million from accident year '18; $8 million, accident year '17; $1 million, '16; and then $13 million favorable development for the prior years to '16. 
Generally speaking, as you know, and I've said on these calls before, we [indiscernible]  consistent approach in what we do and setting the reserves. We've got the same actuarial folks who are setting those reserves, so we haven't had any changeover in that area. We don't know how paid losses will actually occur. We're watching that come in quarter-to-quarter, plus other factors that the actuarial folks will think of. So paid loss -- or paid losses, cost trends have been improving if you look back at Footnote 4 from our 10-K. Even in the first quarter, our case incurred has improved. So in the supplement that we also put out on Page 10, it gives kind of a -- little bit of a preview there, but you'll see our case incurred is down about 20% versus the average per quarter for 2018. So at this point, let's see how the reserves develop, and we're going to follow our actuaries' consistent process in setting reserves."

And as we did a year ago, July 1, actually put -- buy a new contract. Part of that contract, specific to the reinsurance, was a clash cover that we wanted to have, where there might be losses to both traditional Cincinnati Insurance and Cincinnati Re. And basically, even though we disclosed everything, I didn't want the market to be surprised by thinking that we had this clash cover in place when we didn't. Through the modeling, through working on being cognizant of not writing reinsurance where we are exposed on the primary side, we think that the lack of correlation there works in our favor. But just the same, we wanted to get some clash cover.
So the Section A of the contract that we bought last July 1, provided $50 million of coverage excess of $125 million where we might have a loss that would come in from both parties. And that would be one instance where we've looked at reinsurance differently, and we'll continue to look at the growth.

It's just -- it's a competitive environment, and we're just going to have to continue to pick our opportunities. 
I mentioned this last quarter as well, I think one thing that's different about workers' compensation that gives us a little hedge there is that unlike other commercial lines, major coverage lines. If the comp isn't favorable to us, whether it be the underwriting attributes or the pricing, we can typically still write that package and have the agent work with us to get that comp placed somewhere else. 
So yes, we're still -- we still are looking for opportunities. And like I mentioned before, we still want to grow the work comp line, but there's no doubt that it's under pressure. I think it's under pressure for the industry."

First, we had an estimate of what we thought we would pay, which was about GBP 102 million that we had disclosed that back in October. And really then, when it came to closing, which was at the end of February, a lot of those adjustments come with what's the net asset value or the estimated net asset value at that point? And then you add on the implied premium that we were paying for the organization. So.
There we -- when we did close, we paid $64 million for the closing. We have paid an extra $35 million in extra funds at Lloyd's. So that's extra capital. Had Munich put that in before we closed, we would have been closer to the GBP 102 million that we originally disclosed. Thinking about, once you take that, you revalue your assets and the liabilities assumed, you have to look at the intangibles then that fall out from that, goodwill. There's a couple of things I do, or at least one item gets written off. Deferred acquisition costs, that comes off. That doesn't continue on, so that gets written on. 
We did have to relook at the deferred tax assets under U.S. GAAP. How much of that can be realized or you set up a valuation allowance against that, which we did do. And then you add on the premium. So when you add all that together, we really, at least, right now, we're estimating that we've got about $82 million of intangibles and goodwill that will be on our books, subject to further adjustments that can and will occur over the next quarter or 2. 
If I'm thinking about the goodwill, that probably will make up maybe about -- I'm going to say 1/3 of the intangibles and goodwill. We'll have some syndicate capacity, distribution relationships, the value and force. So some of those will be amortized. Some of those will not be amortized. So when you don't have deferred acquisition costs being amortized, being replaced with a little bit of intangibles, you're going to pick up some benefit there, at least during the first 4 quarters, I'll say.

And that is what is driving what you're seeing in terms of we're seeing favorable development for the E&S company. 
So what we're focusing on, and I think where you'll see more consistency, is in that ex cat accident year number and combined ratio, that's been running in the low to mid-80s that we feel very good about that position and the consistency there and the strong performance of CSU, both in growth and profitability.

Thank you very much. Good question. Yes, our value prop for CSU is multifaceted. First and foremost, the time -- at the time when we formed the company, nonadmitted carrier that takes the risk. We also formed a brokerage because you have to have a brokerage involved in the E&S business to take care of surplus lines, taxes and all the compliance that goes with a nonadmitted carrier. So the key with that is that only licensed and appointed contracted agents of Cincinnati Insurance Company have access to our E&S company. 
We do not go through wholesalers, MGAs, MGUs. It's only appointed agents of Cincinnati Insurance company that in effect have direct access through our brokerage to our E&S company. 
Another big factor is that I think you might know that our profit sharing, we would stack it up against anybody in the industry. We include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the agents' profit-sharing calculations. So we share in the profitability of that business with them. I'd like to think we can run the E&S operation leaner than what the marketplace does because we don't have so many cogs in the wheel. And so what we do is we return more of that to the agent. We pay 15% commission up front to the agencies, which in many cases, might be double what they would get in a traditional E&S placement. 
I think most importantly, beyond the compensation is -- on our E&S company, many E&S risks are well-managed good people in the community. They just happen to be in a tough class of business. And when our agents know that our local claims rep that has a relationship with them that's assigned to the agency is also going to handle the E&S claims, that's a big, big deal. Because in many cases, those E&S clients in the other markets would be sent out to a third party. That may handle it just fine, but our agents know exactly what they're going to get from our local claims rep. And it gives them a peace of mind. 
They also have access to all resources of Cincinnati Insurance Company, whether it's loss control, claims, premium audit. We've now introduced, about a year ago -- 18 months ago, direct bill into our E&S, which is unique. That's attractive for our agents and for policyholders as well. 
So we think, again long-winded, we think we've got a really differentiating value proposition in E&S and think that we are just scratching the surface inside our own agencies today. Our E&S business is approximately $275 million, and we've identified that our agencies that we do business with write about $3.5 billion in the market. So our runway to write more business inside our agencies is -- as you can see, is really strong."

And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating performance was quite good, and we believe it reflects our prudent strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term. 
Net income for the first quarter of 2019 was up $726 million from a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities still held accounted for $672 million of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income, which we believe is a better indicator of short-term core operating performance, also improved significantly, up 43%. Our 93.0% property casualty combined ratio was 4.9 percentage points better than the year ago. Slightly worse catastrophe, weather effects in 2019, had an unfavorable effect of 1.4 points, while improved underwriting was indicated by several underlying measures. 
The first quarter again demonstrated experienced management in pricing individual policies, which -- with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That, along with excellent service, helped us to again earn more business through our agencies, contributing to 10% growth in net written premiums with healthy amounts of new business written premiums. 
The Commercial Lines segment had first quarter 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ]estimated average price increases that were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the fourth quarter. That segment's 90.8% combined ratio improved by 7.5 percentage points, while the ratio for catastrophe losses was slightly worse than last year's first quarter. Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases in the high single-digit range as the first quarter was similar to the fourth quarter. The personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was challenged by severe weather. The combined ratio remained a little above 100% as the ratio for catastrophe losses was 4.4 points higher than a year ago.
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter, including double-digit growth in net written premium and a 2019 combined ratio of 83.5%. 
Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned and contributed nicely to underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low 90s. Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, with first quarter up 10% on an earned basis. It's contribution to net income was down by $3 million primarily due to less favorable FX from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions and a net investment loss of approximately $1 million. 
Results for the first quarter also included the month of March for our recently acquired global specialty underwriter and Lloyd's integrated vehicle, MSP Underwriting. We closed the transaction at the end of February with a payment of $64 million, which represents a multiple of 1.9x book value as of the closing. 
MSP contributed $21 million to our first quarter net written premiums and generated an underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low 50s, lower than typical, in part due to favorable aspects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
We remain confident in future prospects for its profitable growth and plan to implement a new name next week for better alignment with Cincinnati's brand and highly regarded reputation. 
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. It was very good for the first quarter at 11.1%. The contribution of net income before investment gains was 2.2% and a strong stock market in the early part of the year helped boost the contribution of investment gains to 9.1%. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other key areas of our financial performance."

In",601,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth was very strong, up 5% for the first quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 10%, a result of dividend rates rising for many of our holdings. Interest income from our bond portfolio was up 1%. The pretax average yield was 4.15% for the first quarter, down 11 basis points from the first quarter a year ago. We continue to invest in bonds, including $19 million in net purchases during the quarter. 
Taxable bonds purchased had an average pretax yield of 4.99%, 88 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.52%, up 20 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds. Our investment portfolio valuation again experienced volatility from security market trends. But for the first quarter of 2019, that was favorable for both our stock and our bond portfolios. 
The overall net gain was $905 million before tax effects. That included $656 million from our equity portfolio and $244 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.5 billion, including $288 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities generated $200 million, up 30%, again, fueling investment income. Speaking of healthy cash flow, that helped to pay for the MSP acquisition without additional borrowing. Also remember, the acquisition can be characterized as bolt-on in nature. Much of the integration work relates to financial processes, and it's proceeding well. As we previously disclosed, for the foreseeable future, we plan to report MSP results as part of other, along with Cincinnati Re. 
Turning to expense management. We continue to invest in our business strategically, while working to avoid wasteful spending. The first quarter 2019 property-casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 1.2 percentage points compared with the 2018 period, and it was basically in line with the full year 2018 ratio. 
Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and again resulted in property-casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the first quarter of 2019 benefit our combined ratio by 5.3 percentage points with our commercial lines segment driving the more favorable result compared with a year ago. 
For commercial casualty, our largest lines of business, we experienced $31 million of favorable reserve development representing nearly half of the property-casualty total. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the quarter. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 24% for accident year 2018, 33% for accident year 2017 and 43% for 2016 and prior accident years. As for capital management, we've proven to be steady over the long term. Our financial strength remains in excellent shape with plenty of financial flexibility. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.44. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.18. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $3.18. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.78 during the first quarter to a record-high $52.88 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve"

This is Steve Spray. Fortune 1000, that would not be a target for us. We are moving up with expertise and specialization in some larger commercial lines risks, and that would be -- we would identify that as in excess of $250,000 in premium just to give you an idea because some national carriers would consider that more middle market. 
As far as rate increases go, we have noticed a change in the marketplace, a noticeable change, since January 1. It's kind of hard candidly to put our finger on exactly where all that is coming from, and I think it's going to continue to evolve. We are certainly seeing commercial auto continue to firm. And as an example, surplus lines traditionally has always been a leading indicator for affirming market, and the number of submissions that are being sent to our E&S subsidiaries, CSU, are up substantially. And there are some traditional classes that kind of float in and out of standard markets and surplus lines market, as an example, habitational risks that they're seeing. But the majority of what they're seeing is kind of validating what I'm saying as far as auto. They're seeing a lot of excess liability, capacity issues in the marketplace for heavy fleet and such. 
So long-winded answer, but I think that the commercial auto marketplace is still firming. I think that -- I believe that we're out in front of it by taking the action we took. And I also think one thing to pay attention, we talked about it last quarter, pay special attention to the average rate increases that are announced. I think the rising tide raising all boats of the past is, it's certainly not the future of Cincinnati Insurance company. We are really focused on executing on segmentation. So while you might see an average rate increase that we have disclosed, that certainly doesn't tell the full story of how we are executing with our agents at the ground floor. 
We are segmenting the book, in that, really attacking the most inadequately portion of our book -- adequately priced portion of our book and doing all we can to retain the most adequately portion of the book and at that price."

But then on the other hand, you're point -- you're talking about appointing a lot more personal lines agencies, and maybe that's the separate high-net-worth initiative that isn't yet substantial.

As far as the growth, personal lines is, rightfully so, under a little bit of pressure to the written premium growth. They are taking prudent, deliberate underwriting action, both underwriting and pricing action, across the country and really focusing on some specific states that need maybe a little stronger action than others. Michigan would be an example. Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, those are just 4 that come to mind where they're really taking strong underwriting and rate action. And it is putting -- those are larger states for us, and it's putting some pressure on the growth as well. 
But we continue to write new business. As you can see, we do continue to appoint new agencies. A lot of those do tend to have a high net worth focus on the personal lines only. But there is committed to the middle market and getting it profitable as well."

Generally speaking, as you know, and I've said on these calls before, we [indiscernible]  consistent approach in what we do and setting the reserves. We've got the same actuarial folks who are setting those reserves, so we haven't had any changeover in that area. We don't know how paid losses will actually occur. We're watching that come in quarter-to-quarter, plus other factors that the actuarial folks will think of. So paid loss -- or paid losses, cost trends have been improving if you look back at Footnote 4 from our 10-K. Even in the first quarter, our case incurred has improved. So in the supplement that we also put out on Page 10, it gives kind of a -- little bit of a preview there, but you'll see our case incurred is down about 20% versus the average per quarter for 2018. So at this point, let's see how the reserves develop, and we're going to follow our actuaries' consistent process in setting reserves."

And basically, even though we disclosed everything, I didn't want the market to be surprised by thinking that we had this clash cover in place when we didn't. Through the modeling, through working on being cognizant of not writing reinsurance where we are exposed on the primary side, we think that the lack of correlation there works in our favor. But just the same, we wanted to get some clash cover.
So the Section A of the contract that we bought last July 1, provided $50 million of coverage excess of $125 million where we might have a loss that would come in from both parties.

So the retention on our auto is a tick below what our homeowner is, and it's even more so in those specific states that I mentioned. And I'd say Ground Zero for us, quite frankly, is Michigan with that. 
Now one other thing to think about as we continue to write more high net worth and change the mix of our business.

It's just simple math. 
We are still managing, I think I mentioned it last quarter. We're managing workers compensation so well out of our claims area and our loss control underwriting and pricing and just feel really good about it. It's just -- it's a competitive environment, and we're just going to have to continue to pick our opportunities. 
I mentioned this last quarter as well, I think one thing that's different about workers' compensation that gives us a little hedge there is that unlike other commercial lines, major coverage lines. If the comp isn't favorable to us, whether it be the underwriting attributes or the pricing, we can typically still write that package and have the agent work with us to get that comp placed somewhere else.

First, we had an estimate of what we thought we would pay, which was about GBP 102 million that we had disclosed that back in October. And really then, when it came to closing, which was at the end of February, a lot of those adjustments come with what's the net asset value or the estimated net asset value at that point? And then you add on the implied premium that we were paying for the organization. So.
There we -- when we did close, we paid $64 million for the closing. We have paid an extra $35 million in extra funds at Lloyd's. So that's extra capital. Had Munich put that in before we closed, we would have been closer to the GBP 102 million that we originally disclosed. Thinking about, once you take that, you revalue your assets and the liabilities assumed, you have to look at the intangibles then that fall out from that, goodwill. There's a couple of things that do, or at least one item gets written off. Deferred acquisition costs, that comes off. That doesn't continue on, so that gets written off. 
We did have to relook at the deferred tax assets under U.S. GAAP. How much of that can be realized or you set up a valuation allowance against that, which we did do. And then you add on the premium. So when you add all that together, we really, at least, right now, we're estimating that we've got about $82 million of intangibles and goodwill that will be on our books, subject to further adjustments that can and will occur over the next quarter or 2. 
If I'm thinking about the goodwill, that probably will make up maybe about -- I'm going to say 1/3 of the intangibles and goodwill. We'll have some syndicate capacity, distribution relationships, the value and force. So some of those will be amortized. Some of those will not be amortized. So when you don't have deferred acquisition costs being amortized, being replaced with a little bit of intangibles, you're going to pick up some benefit there, at least during the first 4 quarters, I'll say.

We have, and I think we've talked about this in some past calls.

And over time, as we gather more actual data for the E&S company, we start to blend that actual CSU data into the computation and estimation of the reserves. And that is what is driving what you're seeing in terms of we're seeing favorable development for the E&S company. 
So what we're focusing on, and I think where you'll see more consistency, is in that ex cat accident year number and combined ratio, that's been running in the low to mid-80s that we feel very good about that position and the consistency there and the strong performance of CSU, both in growth and profitability.

Thank you very much. Good question. Yes, our value prop for CSU is multifaceted. First and foremost, the time -- at the time when we formed the company, nonadmitted carrier that takes the risk, we also formed a brokerage because you have to have a brokerage involved in the E&S business to take care of surplus lines, taxes and all the compliance that goes with a nonadmitted carrier. So the key with that is that only licensed and appointed contracted agents of Cincinnati Insurance Company have access to our E&S company. 
We do not go through wholesalers, MGAs, MGUs. It's only appointed agents of Cincinnati Insurance company that in effect have direct access through our brokerage to our E&S company. 
Another big factor is that I think you might know that our profit sharing, we would stack it up against anybody in the industry. We include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the agents' profit-sharing calculations. So we share in the profitability of that business with them. I'd like to think we can run the E&S operation leaner than what the marketplace does because we don't have so many cogs in the wheel. And so what we do is we return more of that to the agent. We pay 15% commission up front to the agencies, which in many cases, might be double what they would get in a traditional E&S placement. 
I think most importantly, beyond the compensation is -- on our E&S company, many E&S risks are well-managed good people in the community. They just happen to be in a tough class of business. And when our agents know that our local claims rep that has a relationship with them that's assigned to the agency is also going to handle the E&S claims, that's a big, big deal. Because in many cases, those E&S claims in the other markets would be sent out to a third party, that may handle it just fine, but our agents know exactly what they're going to get from our local claims rep. And it gives them a peace of mind. 
They also have access to all resources of Cincinnati Insurance Company, whether it's loss control, claims, premium audit. We've now introduced, about a year ago -- 18 months ago, direct bill into our E&S, which is unique. That's attractive for our agents and for policyholders as well. 
So we think, again long-winded, we think we've got a really differentiating value proposition in E&S and think that we are just scratching the surface inside our own agencies today. Our E&S business is approximately $275 million, and we've identified that our agencies that we do business with write about $3.5 billion in the market. So our runway to write more business inside our agencies is -- as you can see, is really strong."

And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating performance was quite good, and we believe it reflects our prudent strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term. 
Net income for the first quarter of 2019 was up $726 million from a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities still held accounted for $672 million of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income, which we believe is a better indicator of short-term core operating performance, also improved significantly, up 43%. Our 93.0% property casualty combined ratio was 4.9 percentage points better than the year ago. Slightly worse catastrophe, weather effects in 2019, had an unfavorable effect of 1.4 points, while improved underwriting was indicated by several underlying measures. 
The first quarter again demonstrated experienced management in pricing individual policies, which -- with average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty segments. That, along with excellent service, helped us to again earn more business through our agencies, contributing to 10% growth in net written premiums with healthy amounts of new business written premiums. 
The Commercial Lines segment had first quarter 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ]estimated average price increases that were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the fourth quarter. That segment's 90.8% combined ratio improved by 7.5 percentage points, while the ratio for catastrophe losses was slightly worse than last year's first quarter. Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases in the high single-digit range as the first quarter was similar to the fourth quarter. The personal lines fourth quarter combined ratio was challenged by severe weather. The combined ratio remained a little above 100% as the ratio for catastrophe losses was 4.4 points higher than a year ago.
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter, including double-digit growth in net written premium and a 2019 combined ratio of 83.5%. 
Cincinnati Re continued to grow as planned and contributed nicely to underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low 90s. Our life insurance subsidiary again grew term life insurance premiums, with first quarter up 10% on an earned basis. It's contribution to net income was down by $3 million primarily due to less favorable FX from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions and a net investment loss of approximately $1 million. 
Results for the first quarter also included the month of March for our recently acquired global specialty underwriter and Lloyd's integrated vehicle, MSP Underwriting. We closed the transaction at the end of February with a payment of $64 million, which represents a multiple of 1.9x book value as of the closing. 
MSP contributed $21 million to our first quarter net written premiums and generated an underwriting profit with a combined ratio in the low 50s, lower than typical, in part due to favorable aspects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
We remain confident in future prospects for its profitable growth and plan to implement a new name next week for better alignment with Cincinnati's brand and highly regarded reputation. 
I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. It was very good for the first quarter at 11.1%. The contribution of net income before investment gains was 2.2% and a strong stock market in the early part of the year helped boost the contribution of investment gains to 9.1%. 
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other key areas of our financial performance."

In",601,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth was very strong, up 5% for the first quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 10%, a result of dividend rates rising for many of our holdings. Interest income from our bond portfolio was up 1%. The pretax average yield was 4.15% for the first quarter, down 11 basis points from the first quarter a year ago. We continue to invest in bonds, including $19 million in net purchases during the quarter. 
Taxable bonds purchased had an average pretax yield of 4.99%, 88 basis points higher than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.52%, up 20 basis points from a year ago. Despite the higher purchase yields, we continued to experience redemptions of relatively high-coupon bonds. Our investment portfolio valuation again experienced volatility from security market trends. But for the first quarter of 2019, that was favorable for both our stock and our bond portfolios. 
The overall net gain was $905 million before tax effects. That included $656 million from our equity portfolio and $244 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with a net appreciated value of nearly $3.5 billion, including $288 million in our bond portfolio. 
Cash flow from operating activities generated $200 million, up 30%, again, fueling investment income. Speaking of healthy cash flow, that helped to pay for the MSP acquisition without additional borrowing. Also remember, the acquisition can be characterized as bolt-on in nature. Much of the integration work relates to financial processes, and it's proceeding well. As we previously disclosed, for the foreseeable future, we plan to report MSP results as part of other, along with Cincinnati Re. 
Turning to expense management. We continue to invest in our business strategically, while working to avoid wasteful spending. The first quarter 2019 property-casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 1.2 percentage points compared with the 2018 period, and it was basically in line with the full year 2018 ratio. 
Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and again resulted in property-casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the first quarter of 2019 benefit our combined ratio by 5.3 percentage points with our commercial lines segment driving the more favorable result compared with a year ago. 
For commercial casualty, our largest lines of business, we experienced $31 million of favorable reserve development representing nearly half of the property-casualty total. Most of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the quarter. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 24% for accident year 2018, 33% for accident year 2017 and 43% for 2016 and prior accident years. As for capital management, we've proven to be steady over the long term. Our financial strength remains in excellent shape with plenty of financial flexibility. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value-creation ratio. Property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.44. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.47. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.18. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $3.18. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.78 during the first quarter to a record-high $52.88 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve"

We are moving up with expertise and specialization in some larger commercial lines risks, and that would be -- we would identify that as in excess of $250,000 in premium just to give you an idea because some national carriers would consider that more middle market. 
As far as rate increases go, we have noticed a change in the marketplace, a noticeable change, since January 1. It's kind of hard candidly to put our finger on exactly where all that is coming from, and I think it's going to continue to evolve. We are certainly seeing commercial auto continue to firm. And as an example, surplus lines traditionally has always been a leading indicator for affirming market, and the number of submissions that are being sent to our E&S subsidiaries, CSU, are up substantially. And there are some traditional classes that kind of float in and out of standard markets and surplus lines market, as an example, habitational risks that they're seeing. But the majority of what they're seeing is kind of validating what I'm saying as far as auto. They're seeing a lot of excess liability, capacity issues in the marketplace for heavy fleet and such. 
So long-winded answer, but I think that the commercial auto marketplace is still firming. I think that -- I believe that we're out in front of it by taking the action we took. And I also think one thing to pay attention, we talked about it last quarter, pay special attention to the average rate increases that are announced. I think the rising tide raising all boats of the past is, it's certainly not the future of Cincinnati Insurance company. We are really focused on executing on segmentation. So while you might see an average rate increase that we have disclosed, that certainly doesn't tell the full story of how we are executing with our agents at the ground floor. 
We are segmenting the book, in that, really attacking the most inadequately portion of our book -- adequately priced portion of our book and doing all we can to retain the most adequately portion of the book and at that price."

But the top line's growing by 4%, which is less than pricing, which kind of implies that maybe you're -- on an organic basis, you're shrinking a little bit. But then on the other hand, you're point -- you're talking about appointing a lot more personal lines agencies, and maybe that's the separate high-net-worth initiative that isn't yet substantial. So just trying to -- there's kind of some conflicting dynamics, trying to understand how -- what the competitive dynamic is in personal lines and how to think about that going forward for you guys?"

As far as the growth, personal lines is, rightfully so, under a little bit of pressure to the written premium growth. They are taking prudent, deliberate underwriting action, both underwriting and pricing action, across the country and really focusing on some specific states that need maybe a little stronger action than others. Michigan would be an example. Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, those are just 4 that come to mind where they're really taking strong underwriting and rate action. And it is putting -- those are larger states for us, and it's putting some pressure on the growth as well. 
But we continue to write new business. As you can see, we do continue to appoint new agencies. A lot of those do tend to have a high net worth focus on the personal lines only. But there is committed to the middle market and getting it profitable as well."

Generally speaking, as you know, and I've said on these calls before, we [indiscernible]  consistent approach in what we do and setting the reserves. We've got the same actuarial folks who are setting those reserves, so we haven't had any changeover in that area. We don't know how paid losses will actually occur. We're watching that come in quarter-to-quarter, plus other factors that the actuarial folks will think of. So paid loss -- or paid losses, cost trends have been improving if you look back at Footnote 4 from our 10-K. Even in the first quarter, our case incurred has improved. So in the supplement that we also put out on Page 10, it gives kind of a -- little bit of a preview there, but you'll see our case incurred is down about 20% versus the average per quarter for 2018.

And -- we did a year ago, July 1, actually put -- buy a new contract. Part of that contract, specific to the reinsurance, was a clash cover that we wanted to have, where there might be losses to both traditional Cincinnati Insurance and Cincinnati Re. And basically, even though we disclosed everything, I didn't want the market to be surprised by thinking that we had this clash cover in place when we didn't. Through the modeling, through working on being cognizant of not writing reinsurance where we are exposed on the primary side, we think that the lack of correlation there works in our favor. But just the same, we wanted to get some clash cover.
So the Section A of the contract that we bought last July 1, provided $50 million of coverage excess of $125 million where we might have a loss that would come in from both parties. And that would be one instance where we've looked at reinsurance differently, and we'll continue to look at the growth.

So maybe if you put in a blended rate of about 17%, 18% effective tax rate, you'll probably get close on a long-term basis. 
I will probably also say that for MSP, their effective tax rate might be just -- might be around 21%. But because of the size of it and the way that will fluctuate, it probably will not have a significant impact on your overall estimate for an effective tax rate."

First, we had an estimate of what we thought we would pay, which was about GBP 102 million that we had disclosed that back in October. And really then, when it came to closing, which was at the end of February, a lot of those adjustments come with what's the net asset value or the estimated net asset value at that point? And then you add on the implied premium that we were paying for the organization. So.
There we -- when we did close, we paid $64 million for the closing. We have paid an extra $35 million in extra funds at Lloyd's. So that's extra capital. Had Munich put that in before we closed, we would have been closer to the GBP 102 million that we originally disclosed. Thinking about, once you take that, you revalue your assets and the liabilities assumed, you have to look at the intangibles then that fall out from that, goodwill. There's a couple of things that do, or at least one item gets written off. Deferred acquisition costs, that comes off. That doesn't continue on, so that gets written off. 
We did have to relook at the deferred tax assets under U.S. GAAP. How much of that can be realized or you set up a valuation allowance against that, which we did do. And then you add on the premium. So when you add all that together, we really, at least, right now, we're estimating that we've got about $82 million of intangibles and goodwill that will be on our books, subject to further adjustments that can and will occur over the next quarter or 2. 
If I'm thinking about the goodwill, that probably will make up maybe about -- I'm going to say 1/3 of the intangibles and goodwill. We'll have some syndicate capacity, distribution relationships, the value and force. So some of those will be amortized. Some of those will not be amortized. So when you don't have deferred acquisition costs being amortized, being replaced with a little bit of intangibles, you're going to pick up some benefit there, at least during the first 4 quarters, I'll say. 
That's probably more than you wanted to hear, but it's a very complicated question that accountants love to answer."

And that is what is driving what you're seeing in terms of we're seeing favorable development for the E&S company. 
So what we're focusing on, and I think where you'll see more consistency, is in that ex cat accident year number and combined ratio, that's been running in the low to mid-80s that we feel very good about that position and the consistency there and the strong performance of CSU, both in growth and profitability.

Thank you very much. Good question. Yes, our value prop for CSU is multifaceted. First and foremost, the time -- at the time when we formed the company, nonadmitted carrier that takes the risk, we also formed a brokerage because you have to have a brokerage involved in the E&S business to take care of surplus lines, taxes and all the compliance that goes with a nonadmitted carrier. So the key with that is that only licensed and appointed contracted agents of Cincinnati Insurance Company have access to our E&S company. 
We do not go through wholesalers, MGAs, MGUs. It's only appointed agents of Cincinnati Insurance company that in effect have direct access through our brokerage to our E&S company. 
Another big factor is that I think you might know that our profit sharing, we would stack it up against anybody in the industry. We include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the agents' profit-sharing calculations. So we share in the profitability of that business with them. I'd like to think we can run the E&S operation leaner than what the marketplace does because we don't have so many cogs in the wheel. And so what we do is we return more of that to the agent. We pay 15% commission up front to the agencies, which in many cases, might be double what they would get in a traditional E&S placement. 
I think most importantly, beyond the compensation is -- on our E&S company, many E&S risks are well-managed good people in the community. They just happen to be in a tough class of business. And when our agents know that our local claims rep that has a relationship with them that's assigned to the agency is also going to handle the E&S claims, that's a big, big deal. Because in many cases, those E&S claims in the other markets would be sent out to a third party, that may handle it just fine, but our agents know exactly what they're going to get from our local claims rep. And it gives them a peace of mind. 
They also have access to all resources of Cincinnati Insurance Company, whether it's loss control, claims, premium audit. We've now introduced, about a year ago -- 18 months ago, direct bill into our E&S, which is unique. That's attractive for our agents and for policyholders as well. 
So we think, again long-winded, we think we've got a really differentiating value proposition in E&S and think that we are just scratching the surface inside our own agencies today. Our E&S business is approximately $275 million, and we've identified that our agencies that we do business with write about $3.5 billion in the market. So our runway to write more business inside our agencies is -- as you can see, is really strong."

And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Operating performance was very good, particularly, given the challenging spring weather including storms affecting the [indiscernible] Ohio area with insured losses that exceeded the $100 million retention level of our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty. 
We believe our steadily improving results reflect our proven strategy and careful execution as we continue efforts to grow profitably over the long term. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2019 nearly doubled the amount of the year ago. Changed in the fair value of equity securities held at June 30 produced most of the increase. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up 5% and is up 23% for the first half of the year. Our 96.5% second quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 0.7 percentage points better than a year ago. Without the effects of natural catastrophes, it was 3.6 points better. 
Our results benefited from efforts to diversify risk by product line and geography in recent years. That, along with the various improvements over time and how we underwrite property risks, helps reduce adverse effects of catastrophic weather events in the Midwest that have tended to impact our second quarter results. 
A major reason for our confidence in improved underwriting performance is progress in segmenting our business, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business, while walking away from opportunities when we judge profit margins be too thin. 
In addition to profit improvement and strong investment results, premium growth in pricing were bright spots for the second quarter as we earned more business through our agencies and augmented that with growth in other areas. 
Our consolidated property-casualty net written premiums rose 9% including renewal price increases and nice growth in new business written premiums. 
Commercial lines segment had second quarter 2009 estimated average price increases that were slightly higher than all the low single-digit percentages increases of the first quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was [ 4.4 ] percentage points worse than last year's second quarter, although it was 0.8 points better on a before-catastrophe loss basis. 
Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases but slightly lower than the first half -- the first quarter of 2019, personal auto remained in the high single-digit range. 
The personal lines second quarter combined ratio improved significantly and was below 100% as personal auto profitability continued to improve. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and net written premium growth exceeding 20%. 
We've seen abundant growth opportunities in the E&S market, while our underwriting appetite has remained consistent with recent years. 
Cincinnati Re had a very good quarter of growth and profitability with the combined ratio in the mid-80s. Cincinnati Global had its first full quarter contribution to our results and did quite well with the combined ratio in the mid-70s. 
As we noted last quarter, purchase accounting has favorable effects on Cincinnati Global's expense ratio for the first few periods following its acquisition. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow term life insurance premiums in the second quarter, up 7% on an earned basis. 
The net income contribution was not as good as last year, but this part of our business is another source of risk and earnings diversification. 
I'll finish with highlighting the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. 
Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 6.8% for the second quarter and 18.6% for the first half. 
The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4% for the first 6 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. 
Despite short-term variability effects, market appreciation over time as we manage our stock portfolio remains an important part of our long-term value creation for shareholders. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other important areas of our financial performance."

Joining us today. Our investment income continued to climb, up 4% for the second quarter of 2019. 
Dividends from our equity portfolio rose 14% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. 
Net purchases of stocks during the second quarter totaled $75 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio was down slightly, decreasing just under 1%. 
The pretax average yield was 4.12% for the second quarter, down 16 basis points from the second quarter a year ago. 
Steady investment in bonds again occurred during the quarter as we made $69 million in net purchases. 
Although the average pretax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax-exempt bonds was a little lower than in recent quarters. For the first 6 months of 2019, it was 6 basis points higher than the same period in 2018 and within 2 basis points of the full year 2018 purchases. 
Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2019 were favorable, both for our stock and bond portfolios. 
The overall net gain was $564 million before tax effects, that included $366 million for equity portfolio and $199 million for our bond portfolio. 
We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of more than $4 billion, including nearly $0.5 billion in our bond portfolio. 
Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $476 million for the first 6 months of 2019, up $12 million even after paying $57 million more this year in catastrophe losses. 
Regarding expense management, we watch our spending carefully as we make strategic business investments. 
The second quarter 2019 property-casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.4 percentage points higher than last year's second quarter but matched the full year 2018 period and was within [ 1/10 ] of a percentage point of the average of 4 year 2016 through 2018. 
Moving in next to reserves. We apply consistent approach as we continue to aim for net amount in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
During the second quarter of 2019, we again experienced a healthy amount of property-casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefited our combined ratio by 6.4 percentage points of 2 longer tailed lines, commercial casualty and workers compensation, represented nearly 2/3 of the property-casualty total. 
Other than homeowner, each of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the first half of this year. 
On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 29% for accident year 2018, 26% for accident year 2017 and 45% for 2016 and prior accident years. 
On the subject of capital management, the approach there is also stable. Our financial strength remains stellar, providing plenty of financial flexibility. As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.23. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.58. 
Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.96. 
Net investment gains and losses from the equity portfolio increased book value by $1.77, and we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $$3.04 during the second quarter to a record high $55.92 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

In August, our field associates from across the country will come together in Cincinnati to celebrate the progress we are making to attend educational opportunities and to plan for the future. 
It's a great opportunity to reinforce our Cincinnati advantages and to learn from our associates about the opportunities they are seeing firsthand. 
Our strong performance for the first half of the year bodes well for the future.

This is Steve Spray. You're right, second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we've -- what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range; commercial property, mid-single digits; casualty,",369,"Yes, Mike. This is Steve Spray. You're right, second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we've -- what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range; commercial property, mid-single digits; casualty, low single-digit; and workers compensation is down mid-single, just as a reminder. 
I think we talked or I commented on this last quarter as well. I think that the averages really tell the complete story for the way we're trying to execute with our agents, both on new business and on renewals. 
As an example, while we remain consistent in that high single-digit range on the commercial auto, we're really focused on executing on segmentation. So a portion of our book that the analytics that we have that would indicate that we have a lessen [indiscernible] chance for profit or leased adequately priced business in other way to put it. 
We are getting increases far in the excess of our average. And then on the business that we see that is most adequately priced, we're working with our agents to really focus on the retention there. 
And that will impact the average but it also, if you think about it, it's improving our mix. 
And we don't just do that in commercial auto, we take that across all major lines of business in commercial lines, new and renewal. 
Now to comment, I think I'd like to add a little extra color too because we are seeing in the marketplace a pronounced firming, hardening, how do you like to put it, and it's focused on some specific areas in commercial lines. As an example, habitational risks so apartments, condos, anything coastal, large property schedules or large property risks, we're seeing an additional firming in that. Commercial auto, of course, we're seeing there. Commercial auto would be the area that we would track with the industry. Those other areas, we certainly have larger property risks, larger property schedules. We have some tougher casualty, we have a little coastal as well. But on a relative basis, not to the rest of the industry. So think that's what's driving some of the muting of what you're seeing there as well. Does it make sense?"

It really hasn't changed between the different subsidiaries, if you will. so for the Life Insurance Company, there is no dividends received deduction, so you're still going to have a 21% rate there. So therefore, we don't hold any stocks where we get dividend income in the life company. 
For the property casualty companies, you do get partial dividends received deductions. So our effective tax rate on dividend income, there would be about 13%. And then for the non-insurance subsidiaries, which would be like the parent company or CFCI. Again, we do get a dividends received deduction, the effective tax rate there is going to be about 10.5%. 
So there's still a benefits for holding that. There was also a few changes on the tax exempt interest. But if I think about it in total, related to our investment income, whether it's interest income on dividend income, our effective tax yield or effective tax rate would be about 16%. If you add that on top of the non-investment income so through operations, gains and losses, which will come in at 21%, our effective tax rate will probably be in the 17%, 18% range if you have the same mix.

Operating performance was very good, particularly, given challenging spring weather, including storms affecting the Dayton, Ohio area with insured losses that exceeded the $100 million retention level of our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty. We believe our steadily improving results reflect our proven strategy and careful execution as we continue efforts to grow profitably over the long term.
Net income for the second quarter of 2019 nearly doubled the amount of a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities held at June 30 produced most of the increase.
Non-GAAP operating income was up 5% and is up 23% for the first half of the year. Our 96.5% second quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 0.7 percentage points better than a year ago. Without the effects of natural catastrophes, it was 3.6 points better.
Our results benefited from efforts to diversify risk by product line and geography in recent years. That, along with the various improvements over time and how we underwrite property risks, helps reduce adverse effects of catastrophic weather events in the Midwest that have tended to impact our second quarter results.
A major reason for our confidence in improved underwriting performance is progress in segmenting our business, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business while walking away from opportunities when we judge profit margins to be too thin.
In addition to profit improvement and strong investment results, premium growth in pricing were bright spots for the second quarter as we earn more business through our agencies and augment that with growth in other areas. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 9%, including renewal price increases and nice growth in new business written premiums.
Commercial lines segment had second quarter 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] estimated average price increases that were slightly higher than the low single-digit percentages increases of the first quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 4.4 percentage points worse than last year's second quarter, although it was 0.8 points better on a before catastrophe loss basis.
Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases. While slightly lower than the first half -- or the first quarter of 2019, personal auto remained in the high single-digit range. The personal lines second quarter combined ratio improved significantly and was below 100% as personal auto profitability continued to improve.
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and net written premium growth exceeding 20%. We've seen abundant growth opportunities in the E&S market while our underwriting appetite has remained consistent with recent years.
Cincinnati Re had a very good quarter of growth and profitability with the combined ratio in the mid-80s. Cincinnati Global had its first full quarter contribution to our results and did quite well with the combined ratio in the mid-70s. As we noted last quarter, purchase accounting has favorable effects on Cincinnati Global's expense ratio for the first few periods following its acquisition.
Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow term life insurance premiums in the second quarter, up 7% on an earned basis. The net income contribution was not as good as last year, but this part of our business is another source of risk and earnings diversification.
I'll finish with highlighting the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 6.8% for the second quarter and 18.6% for the first half.
The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4% for the first 6 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. Despite short-term variability effects, market appreciation over time as we manage our stock portfolio remains an important part of our long-term value creation for shareholders.
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other important areas of our financial performance."

Our investment income continued to climb, up 4% for the second quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio rose 14% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings.
Net purchases of stocks during the second quarter totaled $75 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio was down slightly, decreasing just under 1%. The pretax average yield was 4.12% for the second quarter, down 16 basis points from the second quarter a year ago.
Steady investment in bonds again occurred during the quarter as we made $69 million in net purchases. Although the average pretax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax-exempt bonds was a little lower than in recent quarters, for the first 6 months of 2019, it was 6 basis points higher than the same period in 2018 and within 2 basis points of the full year 2018 purchases.
Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2019 were favorable, both for our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $564 million before tax effects. That included $366 million for equity portfolio and $199 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of more than $4 billion, including nearly $0.5 billion in our bond portfolio.
Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $476 million for the first 6 months of 2019, up $12 million even after paying $57 million more this year in catastrophe losses.
Regarding expense management, we watch our spending carefully as we make strategic business investments. The second quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.4 percentage points higher than last year's second quarter but matched the full year 2018 period and was within 0.1 percentage point of the average of full years 2016 through 2018.
Moving next to reserves. We apply a consistent approach as we continue to aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2019, we again experienced a healthy amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years.
Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefited our combined ratio by 6.4 percentage points. Of -- two longer-tailed lines, commercial casualty and workers compensation, represented nearly 2/3 of the property casualty total.
Other than homeowner, each of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the first half of this year. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 29% for accident year 2018, 26% for accident year 2017 and 45% for 2016 and prior accident years.
On the subject of capital management, the approach there is also stable. Our financial strength remained stellar, providing plenty of financial flexibility.
As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.23. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.58.
Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.96. Net investment gains and losses from the equity portfolio increased book value by $1.77. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $$3.04 during the second quarter to a record high $55.92 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

This is Steve Spray. You're right, second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we've -- what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range; commercial property, mid-single digits; casualty,",375,"Yes, Mike. This is Steve Spray. You're right, second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we've -- what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range; commercial property, mid-single digits; casualty, low single digit; then workers compensation is down mid-single, just as a reminder.
I think we talked -- or I commented on this on the last quarter as well. I don't think that the averages really tell the complete story for the way we're trying to execute with our agents, both on new business and on renewals.
As an example, while we remain consistent in that high single-digit range on the commercial auto, we're really focused on executing on segmentation. So a portion of our book that the analytics that we have that would indicate that we have a lessened -- opportune chance for profit or least adequately priced business, another way to put it, we are getting increases far in excess of our average. And then on the business that we see that is most adequately priced, we're working with our agents to really focus on the retention there.
And that will impact the average, but it also, if you think about it, it's improving our mix. And we don't just do that in commercial auto. We take that across all major lines of business in commercial lines, new and renewal.
Now the comment -- I think I'd like to add a little extra color too because we are seeing in the marketplace a pronounced firming, hardening, however you like to put it, and it's focused on some specific areas in commercial lines. As an example, habitational risks, so apartments, condos, anything coastal, large property schedules or large property risks, we're seeing an additional firming in that.
Commercial auto, of course, we're seeing that there. Commercial auto would be the area that we would track with the industry. Those other areas, we certainly have larger property risks, larger property schedules. We have some tougher casualty, we have a little coastal as well. But on a relative basis, not to the rest of the industry. So I think that's what's driving some of the muting of what you're seeing there as well. Does it make sense?"

Basically, it's a part of Cincinnati Insurance, and it puts us in a position to just not have pressure to grow into a capital base to maybe be incented to take a little bit more risk to provide a return on a capital amount that's been allocated.
To that point, we have a very small but talented group. I think there's about 20 in the Cincinnati Re that are performing, I think, at a high level in there. It puts them in a position where they can just, on a risk-adjusted basis, look policy by policy. It's not at all top-down dictated, it's very much our people getting more and more opportunities.
As we see in the marketplace, Cincinnati Re is just developing their reputation and getting a lot more looks, maintaining their underwriting discipline. And we can be very selective in the risks that we entertain and the contracts that we entertain.
In terms of Cincinnati Global, our Lloyd's subsidiary, again very happy with the way they're started. They're a talented group that's been profitable 20 out of the last 24 years.

The macro things in the marketplace, so those macro effects, haven't gone away. Those would be examples of just distracted driving. We have an improving economy. There's increased miles being driven.

It really hasn't changed between the different subsidiaries, if you will. So for the Life Insurance Company, there is -- no dividends received deduction, so you're still going to have a 21% rate there. So therefore, we don't hold any stocks where we get dividend income in the life company.
For the property casualty companies, you do get partial dividends received deduction. So our effective tax rate on dividend income there would be about 13%. And then for the noninsurance subsidiaries, which would be like the parent company or CFCI, again, we do get a dividends received deduction. The effective tax rate there is going to be about 10.5%.
So there still are benefits for holding that. There were also a few changes on the tax-exempt interest. But if I think about it in total, related to our investment income, whether it's interest income or dividend income, our effective tax yield or effective tax rate would be about 16%. If you add that on top of the noninvestment income, so through operations, gains and losses, which will come in at 21%, our effective tax rate will probably be in the 17%, 18% range if you have the same mix.
This quarter, our effective tax rate was around 19%, a little bit higher, but that's primarily because of the movement of unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio were so much that kind of skewed it a little bit more towards the 21%."

Operating performance was very good, particularly, given challenging spring weather, including storms affecting the Dayton, Ohio area with insured losses that exceeded the $100 million retention level of our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty. We believe our steadily improving results reflect our proven strategy and careful execution as we continue efforts to grow profitably over the long term.
Net income for the second quarter of 2019 nearly doubled the amount of a year ago. Changes in the fair value of equity securities held at June 30 produced most of the increase.
Non-GAAP operating income was up 5% and is up 23% for the first half of the year. Our 96.5% second quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 0.7 percentage points better than a year ago. Without the effects of natural catastrophes, it was 3.6 points better.
Our results benefited from efforts to diversify risk by product line and geography in recent years. That, along with various improvements over time and how we underwrite property risks, helps reduce adverse effects of catastrophic weather events in the Midwest that have tended to impact our second quarter results.
A major reason for our confidence in improved underwriting performance is progress in segmenting our business, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business while walking away from opportunities when we judge profit margins to be too thin.
In addition to profit improvement and strong investment results, premium growth in pricing were bright spots for the second quarter as we earned more business through our agencies and augment that with growth in other areas. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 9%, including renewal price increases and [ nice ] growth in new business written premiums.
Commercial lines segment had second quarter 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] estimated average price increases that were slightly higher than the low single-digit percentages increases of the first quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 4.4 percentage points worse than last year's second quarter, although it was 0.8 points better on a before catastrophe loss basis.
Our personal lines segment continued to experience average rate increases. While slightly lower than the first half -- or the first quarter of 2019, personal auto remained in the high single-digit range. The personal lines second quarter combined ratio improved significantly and was below 100% as personal auto profitability continued to improve.
Our excess and surplus lines segment had another outstanding quarter with a combined ratio below 80% and net written premium growth exceeding 20%. We've seen abundant growth opportunities in the E&S market while our underwriting appetite has remained consistent with recent years.
Cincinnati Re had a very good quarter of growth and profitability with the combined ratio in the mid-80s. Cincinnati Global had its first full quarter contribution to our results and did quite well with the combined ratio in the mid-70s. As we noted last quarter, purchase accounting has favorable effects on Cincinnati Global's expense ratio for the first few periods following [ its ] acquisition.
Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow term life insurance premiums in the second quarter, up 7% on an earned basis. The net income contribution was not as good as last year, but this part of our business is another source of risk and earnings diversification.
I'll finish with highlighting the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 6.8% for the second quarter and 18.6% for the first half.
The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4% for the first 6 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. Despite short-term variability effects, market appreciation over time as we manage our stock portfolio remains an important part of our long-term value creation for shareholders.
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other important areas of our financial performance."

Our investment income continued to climb, up 4% for the second quarter of 2019. Dividends from our equity portfolio rose 14% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings.
Net purchases of stocks during the second quarter totaled $75 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio was down slightly, decreasing just under 1%. The pretax average yield was 4.12% for the second quarter, down 16 basis points from the second quarter a year ago.
Steady investment in bonds again occurred during the quarter as we made $69 million in net purchases. Although the average pretax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax-exempt bonds was a little lower than in recent quarters, for the first 6 months of 2019, it was 6 basis points higher than the same period in 2018 and within 2 basis points of the full year 2018 purchases.
Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2019 were favorable, both for our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $564 million before tax effects. That included $366 million for our equity portfolio and $199 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of more than $4 billion, including nearly $0.5 billion in our bond portfolio.
Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $476 million for the first 6 months of 2019, up $12 million even after paying $57 million more this year in catastrophe losses.
Regarding expense management, we watch our spending carefully as we make strategic business investments. The second quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.4 percentage points higher than last year's second quarter but matched the full year 2018 period and was within 0.1 percentage point of the average of full years 2016 through 2018.
Moving next to reserves. We apply a consistent approach as we continue to aim for net amounts in the upper half of the [ actuarially ] estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2019, we again experienced a healthy amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years.
Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefited our combined ratio by 6.4 percentage points. Of -- two longer-tailed lines, commercial casualty and workers compensation, represented nearly 2/3 of the property casualty total.
Other than homeowner, each of our major lines of business experienced favorable reserve development during the first half of this year. On an all-lines basis by accident year, it included 29% for accident year 2018, 26% for accident year 2017 and 45% for 2016 and prior accident years.
On the subject of capital management, the approach there is also stable. Our financial strength remained stellar, providing plenty of financial flexibility.
As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.23. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.58.
Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.96. Net investment gains and losses from the equity portfolio increased book value by $1.77. And we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $3.04 during the second quarter to a record high $55.92 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

You're right, second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we've -- what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range; commercial property, mid-single digits; casualty,",379,"Yes, Mike. This is Steve Spray. You're right, second quarter, just from our major lines of business, what we've -- what we're experiencing is in commercial auto, we're still in the high single-digit range; commercial property, mid-single digits; casualty, low single digit; then workers compensation is down mid-single, just as a reminder.
I think we talked -- or I commented on this on the last quarter as well. I don't think that the averages really tell the complete story for the way we're trying to execute with our agents, both on new business and on renewals.
As an example, while we remain consistent in that high single-digit range on the commercial auto, we're really focused on executing on segmentation. So a portion of our book that the analytics that we have that would indicate that we have a lessened -- opportune chance for profit or least adequately priced business, another way to put it, we are getting increases far in excess of our average. And then on the business that we see that is most adequately priced, we're working with our agents to really focus on the retention there.
And that will impact the average, but it also, if you think about it, it's improving our mix. And we don't just do that in commercial auto. We take that across all major lines of business in commercial lines, new and renewal.
Now the comment -- I think I'd like to add a little extra color [ to ] because we are seeing in the marketplace a pronounced firming, hardening, however you like to put it, and it's focused on some specific areas in commercial lines. As an example, habitational risks, so apartments, condos, anything coastal, large property schedules or large property risks, we're seeing an additional firming in that.
Commercial auto, of course, we're seeing that there. Commercial auto would be the area that we would track with the industry. Those other areas, we certainly have larger property risks, larger property schedules. We have some [ tougher ] casualty, we have a little coastal as well. But on a relative basis, not to the rest of the industry. So I think that's what's driving some of the muting of what you're seeing there as well. Does it make sense?"

And so I think the deeper that we dig into it and the confidence we have in our consistent approach to setting the reserves gives us great confidence.

I think one thing that we've done that was -- the way to do it on the Cincinnati Re was to not establish a separate company there.

To that point, we have a very small but talented group. I think there's about 20 in the Cincinnati Re that are performing, I think, at a high level in there. It puts them in a position where they can just, on a risk-adjusted basis, look policy by policy. It's not at all top-down dictated, it's very much our people getting more and more opportunities.
As we see in the marketplace, Cincinnati Re is just developing their reputation and getting a lot more looks, maintaining their underwriting discipline. And we can be very selective in the risks that we entertain and the contracts that we entertain.
In terms of Cincinnati Global, our Lloyd's subsidiary, again very happy with the way they're started. They're a talented group that's been profitable 20 out of the last 24 years. We think we have sufficient capital there to execute on the business plans that they have submitted and received approval for, and we will keep a close eye on that.
So in the sense that I don't want to show any lack of confidence in it either by not saying we're going to pour more capital into it. But we think we have adequate capital in both places, and we think that both are executing at a high level."

When we look at the tax rate for the dividends received deduction as it was changed a bit by the new tax reform and jobs creation act, it really didn't affect the overall tax rate for the dividends because the rate came down, but the part that could be offset there went up a little bit, and the overall effective tax rate for the dividends that we receive remained really pretty much unchanged.

It really hasn't changed between the different subsidiaries, if you will. So for the Life Insurance Company, there is -- no dividends received deduction, so you're still going to have a 21% rate there. So therefore, we don't hold any stocks where we get dividend income in the life company.
For the property casualty companies, you do get partial dividends received deduction. So our effective tax rate on dividend income there would be about 13%. And then for the noninsurance subsidiaries, which would be like the parent company or CFCI, again, we do get a dividends received deduction. The effective tax rate there is going to be about 10.5%.
So there still are benefits for holding that. There were also a few changes on the tax-exempt interest. But if I think about it in total, related to our investment income, whether it's interest income or dividend income, our effective tax yield or effective tax rate would be about 16%. If you add that on top of the noninvestment income, so through operations, gains and losses, which will come in at 21%, our effective tax rate will probably be in the 17%, 18% range if you have the same mix.
This quarter, our effective tax rate was around 19%, a little bit higher, but that's primarily because of the movement of unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio were so much that kind of skewed it a little bit more towards the 21%."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We believe our improving results reflect our winning strategy and dedication to executing it well. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2019 was very good. Although, it did not match our results from a year ago when changes in the fair value of equity securities represented nearly 2/3 of the total. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up an impressive 31% and is up 26% for the first 9 months of this year. 
Every segment of our business performed well, and it was nice to see an underwriting profit in each of our property casualty operating units for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. 
Our 94.2% third quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 2.6 percentage points better than a year ago, and it improved 2.7 points on a year-to-date basis. 
We continue to see benefits from work in recent years to diversify risk by product line and geography. 
We also are pleased with results from ongoing segmentation of risks, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business. 
That gives us increasing confidence to decline opportunities when we determine profit margins are unsatisfactory. 
We also benefit from having outstanding independent insurance agents, representing the company. They understand how to communicate value to their clients, and they continue to produce more premium revenues for us as we earn a larger share of their business. 
Our consolidated property casualty net written premium rose 8%, including renewal price increases and healthy growth in new business written premiums. 
The commercial lines segment's third quarter 2019 estimated average price increases were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the second quarter. 
The combined ratio for commercial lines was 2.5 percentage points better than the third quarter a year ago and 1.8 points better on a year-to-date basis. 
Our personal lines segment also continued to experience average rate increases similar to the second quarter of 2019. 
We're encouraged by 2 consecutive quarters with the personal lines underwriting profit, and believe we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment continues to perform very well, including a third quarter combined ratio below 85% and net written premium growth of 25%. 
Cincinnati Re continues to perform as planned with the year-to-date combined ratio in the low 90s. Cincinnati global experience a very profitable quarter and has a post-acquisition combined ratio in the low 80s, including some favorable effects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continue to grow its business with third quarter term life insurance premiums up 12% on an earned basis. 
While as net income contribution was not as strong as last year, Cincinnati life provides value diversification to our insurance risks and our earnings. 
More importantly, agents appreciate the ability to add life insurance solutions for their clients, all under the Cincinnati umbrella. 
Our investment performance also continues to be outstanding. Investment income continues to grow and our equity portfolio during the first 3 quarters of this year has outperformed the S&P 500. 
I'll wrap up with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. 
Improving operating results and favorable securities markets resulted in a third quarter BCR of 3.6%, boosting the 9-month measure to 22.8%, well above our targeted annual average of 10% to 13%. 
The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 6.3% for the first 9 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. 
While our equity portfolio supported our healthy VCR, we understand the risk of short-term variability due to market effects. We believe it's potential for long-term appreciation is important for creating value for shareholders overtime. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will share insights on other important areas of our financial results."

Our investment income rose again, up 5% for the third quarter of 2019 before income tax effects. 
Dividend growth from our equity portfolio was 11% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. 
Net purchases of stocks during the third quarter totaled $77 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio declined slightly from the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.03% for the third quarter, down 16 basis points from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to invest in bonds with third quarter net purchases of $208 million. As we reported our 10-Q, the average pretax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax-exempt bonds was roughly 60 basis points lower than the same period in 2018, so interest income may continue to be pressured. 
Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2019 were again favorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. 
The overall net gain was $186 million before tax effects. That included $89 million for equity portfolio and $99 million for our bond portfolio. 
We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of $4.2 billion, including $3.6 billion in our equity portfolio. 
Cash flow remained strong and fueled investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $880 million for the first 9 months of 2019, up 7% or $54 million, even after paying $114 million more this year in catastrophe losses. 
Another important area for management is balancing expense controls with strategic investments to aid in the profitable growth of our business. 
The third quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter. But on a 9-month basis, it matched the average of full years 2016 through 2018. 
Regarding reserving, doing so carefully is imperative. We aim for a consistent approach as we target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. 
During the third quarter 2019, we experienced a satisfactory amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. 
Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points. 
On a year-to-date, all lines basis by accident year, it included 33% for accident year 2018, 27% for accident year 2017 and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years.
Regardless of whether the root cause of particular changes and loss control trends is from social inflation or other matters, we do our best to establish adequate reserves. For example, we have disclosed that since the end of 2015, we've increased our commercial casualty total loss reserves by $324 million or 26%. 
The IBNR component of that total is up $220 million or 49%. During the same period, annualized earned premiums one way to estimate the change in insured exposure is up only 8%. 
For commercial auto, total loss reserves are up 44% with the IBNR component up 158%, while earned premiums are up 25%. 
Turning to managing capital, another critical function for the company. Our approach remains stable. Our financial strength is excellent as is our financial flexibility. 
As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. 
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.08. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.62. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.48. 
Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.43, and we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. 
The net effect was a book value increase of $1.45 during the third quarter to a record high $57.37 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

If I look at your year-to-date losses paid versus incurred levels for commercial casualty and commercial auto, they -- just the ratio does seems to be higher year-over-year, I think, or could be wrong year-over-year but it's close to 100%. Does that indicate that you potentially are seeing a rise in loss inflation trends? 
I don't know your view there. Are you guys seeing any changes, some of your competitors, the larger ones, have said that they are seeing an increase in trend. And they also pointed out that they're getting more pricing, so maybe you could comment on that?"

As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the lowest paid in incurred that we had. So if we look at it more over the long term, we think we've addressed our reserving position in casualty and commercial auto and really all the lines very consistently over time. And I think I break it down, going back to 2015, 2016 as Mike pointed out in this conference call. 
We look at inflation in total. So social inflation or any other kind of inflation would be a part of that, and we have a very talented actuarial team. They use a very sophisticated basket of techniques to come up with the estimate. 
One of them that they use is a multiple regression method that regresses not only over the accident years, the development years but also the calendar years. And that regression over the calendar years makes an explicit estimation of inflation effects. 
And so I thought it was important that Mike pointed out that while the total reserve has been increasing much more than the earned premium or our proxy for exposure. Within that increase, the IBNR was up significantly. The IBNR for casualty over that period of time was up 49%; the auto, up to 158%. And if you think about it, we like most people, that IBNR component has a provision for both the development on case incurred losses, which our claims department does a great job of estimating, and those are claims that have actually been reported and we put an estimate on it. So within that IBNR, there's a good bit of -- for pure IBNR, pure incurred but not reported claims. And so I think a lot of the inflationary effects, no matter how we described them, would be in those ones that we really don't know about yet. The incurred but not reporting. And I think over the history of our company, we've just really done a good job of being prudent in terms of estimating the total reserve. And I think this increase in IBNR that we've had over a period of time has put us really in a good position. I think it's manifested in now 29 years in a row that we've had our reserves developed favorably, and we really just think our best to estimate for our lines of business, we're all in a good position right now. So that's part of it. That's the reserving part of your question, I think. 
And I think that that's an important part of it because you don't want to have to be paying for adverse development on prior years. So we feel we're in a good position in terms of our current reserves. 
On the pricing side of it, again, and I might ask Steve Spray to contribute a bit here too. But I think between where we estimate the loss cost trends and where we think we're getting rate. And when we throw in that rate, we really throw in the contribution of the segmentation that we're doing in terms of not treating every risk the same. We really differentiating segmenting, treating each risk on its own merits. And so we are -- we feel good about our position in commercial casualty. If you take just the overall commercial expense ratios of 32% and add it to either are accident year x-cap, loss ratio of the calendar year, and we're under 100. And so we feel both on the reserve side and on the property or on the pricing and underwriting side, we're in a good spot too."

So is that trend mostly due to decreases in pricing? And on the other hand, what's causing so much of reserve releases to come out. Is it both severity and frequency are better, or is it mostly more recent accident years or the older accident years? Any color would be helpful."

On the reserving said, I'll touch on that, and then Steve Spray will touch on the pricing side. But on the reserving side, we -- whenever we set these, we set our reserves with certain assumptions as to inflation settlement practices in all the data that we can look at. And basically what's been happening with the workers compensation is, and I think it's a real team effort around here in terms of every area the company contribute, particularly our claims department, our underwriting department, the pricing department. 
The actuals have just been coming in underneath, what we said is our expectation for the reserve development. So it's just been a matter of actuals comparing favorable to what we put in in terms of the expectation. And you have to be careful with setting those expectations. I'm sure you know in the workers comp, longtail line, a lot of trends have been favorable over time but you have to be careful to keep an eye out for any turning point that there might be.

Professional liability is a much smaller segment. But I think it shows the discipline we have in risk selection and in pricing on the work comp book. 
Just looking at the -- as Steve talked about the segmentation, specifically the workers compensation, and we use the analytics and the tools that we have there.

The majority of that book, about 88% of it, is really traditional casualty business, albeit a little tougher, all right? So it might be -- well, inherently it's going to be a risk that is not eligible for the admitted market. As an example, you might have borrowed tab and the admitted market doesn't feel that it can get the proper terms and conditions or pricing, so that would end up in the E&S market. 
Where I think our differences, and why we are outperforming the industry on our E&S operation is we've stuck to our knitting, like I said before, the underwriters, the entire team has been consistent in their appetite in terms of condition and the pricing. And the value proposition we have for our agents and the policyholders in their the community is different. The traditional E&S route is for a retail agent to go to the wholesale market, and then the wholesale market go to the broader E&S carriers. 
We've formed our own brokerage, our underwriters are employees of the brokerage, our agents have direct access to the decision-makers in our E&S company. 
The other big thing is, now there's several of them. But we gave our agents I think will work confidence on that E&S business because we use all the local resources of Cincinnati Insurance company to bare with our E&S company as well. 
Most importantly, our claims operation. So our agents have a relationship with that local claims adjuster that will handle both the admitted market business as well as nonadmitted. We run our brokerage lean and mean. We can return more of the commission to our agents. And on top of that, we include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the Cincinnati Insurance company overall profit sharing arrangements. So we're aligned with our agent but they send us business that they feel is going to perform better than maybe some other E&S might."

We have had consistent average net rate change that we've reported over the last several quarters. But that doesn't tell the full story. What we're really trying to execute. And I think we're doing a great job in all segments. At the underwriting level working with our agents is focused on segmentation. We're really focused on retaining the most profitable business, the business that we feel we have an opportunity to have a better margin. We are really focused on getting larger rate that's needed on that business that we feel is less apt to drive a profit for us. And our retention spreads look very good there as well. So we are retaining more of that -- more profitable business. We're either getting rate or we're losing some of that business to the market, and we're comfortable with that. It's changing our mix, and I think -- you're seeing it in our results. 
Now that's primarily, what I'm talking about there as commercial lines. The same story is going on in personal lines. You can see it in our auto results. We continue to improve our sophistication on pricing both in the auto in home. That continues to evolve. It's good number that's going to continue to get better. And as everybody is reported, you're seeing better personal auto results, and we're seeing that as well. But there is certainly some variability and volatility going on in the homeowner book and we've seen that as well. And the good news there is we feel like we're in a positive rate environment on homeowner, and we think the runaway is long, and we'll continue that we'll serve everybody well and it's needed. Our E&S company has continued to get low single-digit rate even with the levels of profit that they have generated. They've gotten low single-digit rate quarter over quarter over quarter for quite a while.

We really saw back in 2016 is where we really took a sense of urgency and started taking serious action on the commercial auto book. And again, it goes, to what I mentioned before, we really focused on the segmentation piece of it and risk selection. But just from a pricing standpoint, we really got aggressive starting in 2016, and I really believe that we're out in front of this issue. And the reason I can -- why I am measure that is we have such a close relationship with our agents. We have so few of them, you know our distribution model. But we on a daily basis, we're delivering necessary auto rate change back starting in 2016. We were causing considerable pain, and we heard pretty regularly that we were, quote unquote, an outlier from our agents as far as how hard we were pushing. 
Well, fast forward to fourth quarter '18, really beginning in '19, that pain has really, kind of, gone away. I think it's because others really started noticing and started taking similar action. So if you look at our x-cap accident year on the commercial auto, it is continuing to improve. We haven't crossed the finish line. Now that loss ratio isn't where we wanted to be.

It's -- right now, it's about 28% of our total personal lines book. It's how we would break out high net worth. When we started really focusing on high net worth, being deliberate about it. A little over 5 years ago our book was at about $100 million, and it's now approaching $400 million, written premium this year is up over 30% and new business was up about 25% to give you a little flavor there. 
I will tell you that we've cut an experienced team [indiscernible] will lead personal -- leads all personal lines, came to us with 25 years of high net worth experience, has brought nearly 40 people with him who had many years of high net worth experience as well. 
So overnight, we became a 25-year high net worth experienced company. We were deliberate to get into that business because over time, historically, it is outperformed the broader personal lines market. 
Plus we like the value we bring as a company through claims and our coverage forms and all of that. So it was a natural progression for us there. I will tell you that on the homeowner front, from the very beginning as we're growing this business, we fully expected quarter-to-quarter variability. We're writing larger risks that can have larger losses may also bring larger premiums with them, but we have experienced some of that inherent variability. We did in the third quarter this year with some large losses on high net worth homes as well. 
We've dug in to each one of those. We don't see any trend on geography by agency. You name it. So we think it's, again, it's just inherent variability from quarter-to-quarter, it's expected. We expect it to continue on that front going forward as well. 
Now I think, if you look at the industry, we're seeing many of the competitors are reporting some pain in the high net worth homeowner area as well, and that kind of goes to what I was saying earlier is we think the runaway for rate will remain positive there. It's going to benefit us as well."

We really don't do a lot of different in the fixed income portfolio. The exception in the last couple of years being skewed more favoring taxable versus tax-exempt bonds. There's really 2  kind of 2 variables as to what determines our interest income, that will be kind of the yields on purchase, which would detain you treasure in 100 basis points year-to-date, that's really seeing some pressure on that front. 
On the other hand, I've mentioned in the prior calls, bonds that we have lost through maturities or cost, those yields were very high about a lot of corporate bonds [ 10-year  ] on a call paper during an aftermath of the financial crisis. So we've been bleeding fairly good out of the back door on yields lost, that seems to be abating now. The rest of that we feel confident is over. So if we can get the 10-year treasury, for example, up to, say, 2.5% or 3% range. We think we can get some traction on interest income growth. So we -- again, we typically will choose the point on the yield curve that's got those risk-adjusted, tax adjusted yields and kind of go with that. So and short answer is, we're not really doing anything much different."

The other thing that I would add there is about between 40% to 50% of the time when we write and E&S say casualty line, Cincinnati Insurance company is picking up the other lines of business on the admitted side. So it might be a manufacturing concern as an example that hasn't really tough exposure were not in this company can underwrite it term, condition and pricing appropriately, and then Cincinnati Insurance will write the property, will write the premises liability, the auto workers compensation. So that happens 40% to 50% of the time. So that's driving us more towards casualty as well."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We believe our improving results reflect our winning strategy and dedication to executing it well. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2019 was very good. Although, it did not match our results from a year ago when changes in the fair value of equity securities represented nearly 2/3 of the total. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up an impressive 31% and is up 26% for the first 9 months of this year. Every segment of our business performed well, and it was nice to see an underwriting profit in each of our property casualty operating units for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. 
Our 94.2% third quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 2.6 percentage points better than a year ago, and it improved 2.7 points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to see benefits from work in recent years to diversify risk by product line and geography. We also are pleased with results from ongoing segmentation of risks, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business. That gives us increasing confidence to decline opportunities when we determine profit margins are unsatisfactory. 
We also benefit from having outstanding independent insurance agents, representing the company. They understand how to communicate value to their clients, and they continue to produce more premium revenues for us as we earn a larger share of their business. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 8%, including renewal price increases and healthy growth in new business written premiums. 
The commercial lines segment's third quarter 2019 estimated average price increases were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the second quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 2.5 percentage points better than the third quarter a year ago and 1.8 points better on a year-to-date basis. Our personal lines segment also continued to experience average rate increases similar to the second quarter of 2019.  
We're encouraged by 2 consecutive quarters with the personal lines underwriting profit, and believe we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. Our excess and surplus lines segment continues to perform very well, including a third quarter combined ratio below 85% and net written premium growth of 25%. Cincinnati Re continues to perform as planned with the year-to-date combined ratio in the low 90s. Cincinnati Global experienced a very profitable quarter and has a post-acquisition combined ratio in the low 80s, including some favorable effects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow its business with third quarter term life insurance premiums up 12% on an earned basis. While as net income contribution was not as strong as last year, Cincinnati Life provides valuable diversification to our insurance risks and our earnings. More importantly, agents appreciate the ability to add life insurance solutions for their clients, all under the Cincinnati umbrella. Our investment performance also continues to be outstanding. Investment income continues to grow and our equity portfolio during the first 3 quarters of this year has outperformed the S&P 500. 
I'll wrap up with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Improving operating results and favorable securities markets resulted in a third quarter VCR of 3.6%, boosting the 9-month measure to 22.8%, well above our targeted annual average of 10% to 13%. The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 6.3% for the first 9 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. 
While our equity portfolio supported our healthy VCR, we understand the risk of short-term variability due to market effects. We believe its potential for long-term appreciation is important for creating value for shareholders overtime. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will share insights on other important areas of our financial results."

Our investment income rose again, up 5% for the third quarter of 2019 before income tax effects. Dividend growth from our equity portfolio was 11% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. Net purchases of stocks during the third quarter totaled $77 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio declined slightly from the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.03% for the third quarter, down 16 basis points from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to invest in bonds with third quarter net purchases of $208 million. As we reported in our 10-Q, the average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds was roughly 60 basis points lower than the same period in 2018, so interest income may continue to be pressured. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2019 were again favorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $186 million before tax effects. That included $89 million for equity portfolio and $99 million for our bond portfolio. 
We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of $4.2 billion, including $3.6 billion in our equity portfolio. Cash flow remained strong and fueled investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $880 million for the first 9 months of 2019, up 7% or $54 million, even after paying $114 million more this year in catastrophe losses. Another important area for management is balancing expense controls with strategic investments to aid in the profitable growth of our business. 
The third quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter. But on a 9-month basis, it matched the average of full years 2016 through 2018. Regarding reserving, doing so carefully is imperative. We aim for a consistent approach as we target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the third quarter 2019, we experienced a satisfactory amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefit our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points. 
On a year-to-date, all lines basis by accident year, it included 33% for accident year 2018, 27% for accident year 2017 and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years. Regardless of weather, the root cause of particular changes and loss control trends is from social inflation or other matters, we do our best to establish adequate reserves. For example, we have disclosed that since the end of 2015, we've increased our commercial casualty total loss reserves by $324 million or 26%. 
The IBNR component of that total is up $220 million or 49%. During the same period, annualized earned premiums, one way to estimate the change in insured exposure is up only 8%. For commercial auto, total loss reserves are up 44% with the IBNR component up 158%, while earned premiums are up 25%. 
Turning to managing capital, another critical function for the company. Our approach remains stable. Our financial strength is excellent as is our financial flexibility. As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.08. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.62. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.48. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.43, and we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.45 during the third quarter to a record high, $57.37 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Does that indicate that you potentially are seeing a rise in loss inflation trends? 
I don't know your view there. Are you guys seeing any changes, some of your competitors, the larger ones, have said that they are seeing an increase in trend? And they also pointed out that they're getting more pricing, so maybe you could comment on that."
260681,639175782,1840233,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2019",2019-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And that does seem to be the question of this earning season. As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the",634,"Okay. Thanks, Mike. And that does seem to be the question of this earning season. As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the lowest paid incurred that we had. So if we look at it more over the long term, we think we've addressed our reserving position in casualty, commercial auto and really all the lines very consistently over time. And I think I break it down, going back to 2015, 2016 as Mike pointed out in his conference call. 
We look at inflation in total. So social inflation or any other kind of inflation would be a part of that, and we have a very talented actuarial team. They use a very sophisticated basket of techniques to come up with the estimate. 
One of them that they use is a multiple regression method that regresses not only over the accident years, the development years but also the calendar years. And that regression over the calendar years makes an explicit estimation of inflation effects. 
And so I thought it was important that Mike pointed out that while the total reserve has been increasing much more than the earned premium or our proxy for exposure. Within that increase, the IBNR was up significantly. The IBNR for casualty over that period of time was up 49%; the auto, up 158%. And if you think about it, we like, most people, that IBNR component has a provision for both the development on case incurred losses, which our claims department does a great job of estimating, and those are claims that have actually been reported and we put an estimate on it. So within that IBNR, there's a good bit of -- for pure IBNR, pure incurred but not reported claims. And so I think a lot of the inflationary effects, no matter how we described them, would be in those ones that we really don't know about yet. The incurred but not reporting. And I think over the history of our company, we've just really done a good job of being prudent in terms of estimating the total reserve. And I think this increase in IBNR that we've had over a period of time has put us really in a good position. I think it's manifested in now 29 years in a row that we've had our reserves developed favorably, and we really just think our best to estimate for our lines of business are all in a good position right now. So that's part of it. That's the reserving part of your question, I think. 
And I think that that's an important part of it because you don't want to have to be paying for adverse development on prior years. So we feel we're in a good position in terms of our current reserves. 
On the pricing side of it, again, and I might ask Steve Spray to contribute a bit here too. But I think between where we estimate the loss cost trends and where we think we're getting rate. And when we throw in that rate, we really throw in the contribution of the segmentation that we're doing in terms of not treating every risk the same. We're really differentiating, segmenting, treating each risk on its own merits. And so we are -- we feel good about our position in commercial casualty.

But the top line is coming down a lot and the underlying loss ratio is deteriorating. 
So is that trend mostly due to decreases in pricing? And on the other hand, what's causing so much of reserve releases to come out. Is it both severity and frequency are better, or is it mostly more recent accident years or the older accident years? Any color would be helpful."

On the reserving said, I'll touch on that, and then Steve Spray will touch on the pricing side.

And basically what's been happening with the workers compensation is, and I think it's a real team effort around here in terms of every area the company contribute in, particularly our claims department, our underwriting department, the pricing department. The actuals have just been coming in underneath, what we said is our expectation for the reserve development. 
So it's just been a matter of actuals comparing favorable to what we put in in terms of the expectation. And you have to be careful with setting those expectations. I'm sure you know in the workers comp, longtail line, a lot of the trends have been favorable over time but you have to be careful to keep an eye out for any turning points that there might be.

Of all of our lines, commercial lines, lines of business, the new business is really only off in 2 lines, workers compensation and professional liability. Professional liability is a much smaller segment. But I think it shows the discipline we have in risk selection and in pricing on the work comp book. 
Just looking at the -- as Steve talked about the segmentation, specifically the workers compensation, and we use the analytics and the tools that we have there. We still feel good about our overall pricing of that book of business, but it's no doubt the accident year results are under pressure from the base rate declines."

The majority of that book, about 88% of it, is really traditional casualty business, albeit a little tougher, all right? So it might be -- well, inherently it's going to be a risk that is not eligible for the admitted market. As an example, you might have a borrowed tab and the admitted market doesn't feel that it can get the proper terms and conditions or pricing, so that would end up in the E&S market. 
Where I think our differences, and why we are outperforming the industry on our E&S operation is we've stuck to our knitting, like I said before, the underwriters, the entire team has been consistent in their appetite in terms, conditions and the pricing. And the value proposition we have for our agents and the policyholders and their community is different. The traditional E&S route is for a retail agent to go to the wholesale market, and then the wholesale market go to the broader E&S carriers. 
We've formed our own brokerage, our underwriters are employees of the brokerage, our agents have direct access to the decision-makers in our E&S company. 
The other big thing is, now there's a several of them. But we gave our agents, I think more confidence on that E&S business because we use all the local resources of Cincinnati Insurance company to bear with our E&S company as well. Most importantly, our claims operation. So our agents have a relationship with that local claims adjuster that will handle both the admitted market business as well as the nonadmitted. We run our brokerage lean and mean. We can return more of the commission to our agents. And on top of that, we include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the Cincinnati Insurance company overall profit sharing arrangements. So we're aligned with our agents but they send us business that they feel is going to perform better than maybe some other E&S might."

We have had consistent average net rate change that we've reported over the last several quarters. But that doesn't tell the full story. What we're really trying to execute. And I think we're doing a great job in all segments. At the underwriting level working with our agents is focused on segmentation. We're really focused on retaining the most profitable business, the business that we feel we have an opportunity to have a better margin. We are really focused on getting larger rate that's needed on that business that we feel is less apt to drive a profit for us. And our retention spreads look really good there as well. So we are retaining more of that -- more profitable business. We're either getting rate or we're losing some of that business to the market, and we're comfortable with that. It's changing our mix, and I think it's -- you're seeing it in our results. 
Now that's primarily, what I'm talking about there is commercial lines. The same story is going on in personal lines. You can see it in our auto results. We continue to improve our sophistication on pricing both on the auto, in home. That continues to evolve. It's good number that's going to continue to get better. And as everybody is reporting, you're seeing better personal auto results, and we're seeing that as well. But there is certainly some variability and volatility going on in the homeowner book and we've seen that as well. 
And the good news there is we feel like we're in a positive rate environment on homeowner, and we think the runaway is long, and we'll continue that we'll serve everybody well and it's needed. Our E&S company has continued to get low single-digit rate even with the levels of profit that they've generated. They've gotten low single-digit rate quarter over quarter over quarter for quite a while. 
So that really sums up the way we look at rate, and the way we look at execution, the way we work day-to-day with our agents, Paul."

We really saw back in 2016 is where we really took a sense of urgency and started taking serious action on the commercial auto book. And again, it goes, to what I mentioned before, we really focused on the segmentation piece of it and risk selection. But just from a pricing standpoint, we really got aggressive starting in 2016, and I really believe that we're out in front of this issue. And the reason I can -- why I measure that is we have such a close relationship with our agents. We have so few of them, you know our distribution model. But we on a daily basis, we're delivering necessary auto rate change back starting in 2016. We were causing considerable pain, and we heard pretty regularly that we were, ""an outlier"" from our agents as far as how hard we were pushing. 
Well, fast forward to fourth quarter '18, really beginning in '19, that pain has really, kind of, gone away. And I think it's because others really started noticing and started taking similar action. So if you look at our x-cap accident year on the commercial auto, it is continuing to improve. We haven't crossed the finish line. Now that loss ratio isn't where we wanted to be.

It's -- right now, it's about 28% of our total personal lines book. It's how we would break out high net worth. When we started really focusing on high net worth, being deliberate about it. A little over 5 years ago, our book was at about $100 million, and it's now approaching $400 million, written premium this year is up over 30% and new business was up about 25% to give you a little flavor there. 
I will tell you that we've got an experienced, Will Van Den Heuvel leads personal -- leads all personal lines, came to us with 25 years of high net worth experience, has brought nearly 40 people with him who had many years of high net worth experience as well. 
So overnight, we became a 25-year high net worth experienced company. We were deliberate to get into that business because over time, historically, it has outperformed the broader personal lines market. 
Plus we like the value we bring as a company through claims and our coverage forms and all of that. So it was a natural progression for us there. I will tell you that on the homeowner front, from the very beginning as we're growing this business, we fully expected quarter-to-quarter variability. We're writing larger risks that can have larger losses may also bring larger premiums with them, but we have experienced some of that inherent variability. We did in the third quarter this year with some larger losses on high net worth homes as well. 
We've dug in to each one of those. We don't see any trend on geography by agency. You name it. So we think it's, again, it's just inherent variability from quarter-to-quarter, it's expected. We expect it to continue on that front going forward as well. 
Now I think, if you look at the industry, we're seeing many of the competitors are reporting some pain in the high net worth homeowner area as well, and that kind of goes to what I was saying earlier is we think the runaway for rate will remain positive there. And it's going to benefit us as well."

On the other hand, and I've mentioned in the prior calls, bonds that we have lost through maturities or calls, those yields were very high, it was about a lot of corporate bonds 10-year not a call paper during and in the aftermath of the financial crisis. So we've been bleeding fairly good out the back door on yields lost, that seems to be abating now. The worst of that, we feel confident is over. So if we can get the 10-year treasury, for example, up to, let's say, the 2.5% to 3% range. We think we can get some traction on interest income growth.

The other thing that I would add there is about -- it's between 40% and 50% of the time when we write an E&S, say casualty line, Cincinnati Insurance company is picking up the other lines of business on the admitted side. So it might be a manufacturing concern as an example that has a really tough product liability exposure where our E&S company can underwrite it term, condition and price it appropriately, and then Cincinnati Insurance will write the property, will write the premises liability, the auto workers compensation. So that happens 40% to 50% of the time. So that's driving us more towards casualty as well."

Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We beli",678,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We believe our improving results reflect our winning strategy and dedication to executing it well. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2019 was very good. Although, it did not match our results from a year ago when changes in the fair value of equity securities represented nearly 2/3 of the total. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up an impressive 31% and is up 26% for the first 9 months of this year. Every segment of our business performed well, and it was nice to see an underwriting profit in each of our property casualty operating units for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. 
Our 94.2% third quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 2.6 percentage points better than a year ago, and it improved 2.7 points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to see benefits from work in recent years to diversify risk by product line and geography. We also are pleased with results from ongoing segmentation of risks, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business. That gives us increasing confidence to decline opportunities when we determine profit margins are unsatisfactory. 
We also benefit from having outstanding independent insurance agents, representing the company. They understand how to communicate value to their clients, and they continue to produce more premium revenues for us as we earn a larger share of their business. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 8%, including renewal price increases and healthy growth in new business written premiums. 
The commercial lines segment's third quarter 2019 estimated average price increases were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the second quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 2.5 percentage points better than the third quarter a year ago and 1.8 points better on a year-to-date basis. Our personal lines segment also continued to experience average rate increases similar to the second quarter of 2019.  
We're encouraged by 2 consecutive quarters with the personal lines underwriting profit, and believe we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. Our excess and surplus lines segment continues to perform very well, including a third quarter combined ratio below 85% and net written premium growth of 25%. Cincinnati Re continues to perform as planned with the year-to-date combined ratio in the low 90s. Cincinnati Global experienced a very profitable quarter and has a post-acquisition combined ratio in the low 80s, including some favorable effects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow its business with third quarter term life insurance premiums up 12% on an earned basis. While as net income contribution was not as strong as last year, Cincinnati Life provides valuable diversification to our insurance risks and our earnings. More importantly, agents appreciate the ability to add life insurance solutions for their clients, all under the Cincinnati umbrella. Our investment performance also continues to be outstanding. Investment income continues to grow and our equity portfolio during the first 3 quarters of this year has outperformed the S&P 500. 
I'll wrap up with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Improving operating results and favorable securities markets resulted in a third quarter VCR of 3.6%, boosting the 9-month measure to 22.8%, well above our targeted annual average of 10% to 13%. The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 6.3% for the first 9 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. 
While our equity portfolio supported our healthy VCR, we understand the risk of short-term variability due to market effects. We believe its potential for long-term appreciation is important for creating value for shareholders over time. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will share insights on other important areas of our financial results."

Dividend growth from our equity portfolio was 11% as dividend rates have increased for many",658,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 
Our investment income rose again, up 5% for the third quarter of 2019 before income tax effects. Dividend growth from our equity portfolio was 11% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. Net purchases of stocks during the third quarter totaled $77 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio declined slightly from the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.03% for the third quarter, down 16 basis points from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to invest in bonds with third quarter net purchases of $208 million. As we reported in our 10-Q, the average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds was roughly 60 basis points lower than the same period in 2018, so interest income may continue to be pressured. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2019 were again favorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $186 million before tax effects. That included $89 million for equity portfolio and $99 million for our bond portfolio. 
We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of $4.2 billion, including $3.6 billion in our equity portfolio. Cash flow remained strong and fueled investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $880 million for the first 9 months of 2019, up 7% or $54 million, even after paying $114 million more this year in catastrophe losses. Another important area for management is balancing expense controls with strategic investments to aid in the profitable growth of our business. 
The third quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter. But on a 9-month basis, it matched the average of full years 2016 through 2018. Regarding reserving, doing so carefully is imperative. We aim for a consistent approach as we target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the third quarter 2019, we experienced a satisfactory amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefit our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points. 
On a year-to-date, all lines basis by accident year, it included 33% for accident year 2018, 27% for accident year 2017 and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years. Regardless of weather, the root cause of particular changes and loss control trends is from social inflation or other matters, we do our best to establish adequate reserves. For example, we have disclosed that since the end of 2015, we've increased our commercial casualty total loss reserves by $324 million or 26%. 
The IBNR component of that total is up $220 million or 49%. During the same period, annualized earned premiums, one way to estimate the change in insured exposure is up only 8%. For commercial auto, total loss reserves are up 44% with the IBNR component up 158%, while earned premiums are up 25%. 
Turning to managing capital, another critical function for the company. Our approach remains stable. Our financial strength is excellent as is our financial flexibility. As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.08. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.62. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.48. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.43, and we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.45 during the third quarter to a record high, $57.37 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Does that indicate that you potentially are seeing a rise in loss inflation trends? 
I don't know your view there. Are you guys seeing any changes, some of your competitors, the larger ones, have said that they are seeing an increase in trend? And they also pointed out that they're getting more pricing, so maybe you could comment on that."
260681,639175782,1841938,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2019",2019-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And that does seem to be the question of this earning season. As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the",635,"Okay. Thanks, Mike. And that does seem to be the question of this earning season. As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the lowest paid incurred that we had. So if we look at it more over the long term, we think we've addressed our reserving position in casualty, commercial auto and really all the lines very consistently over time. And I think I break it down, going back to 2015, 2016 as Mike pointed out in his conference call. 
We look at inflation in total. So social inflation or any other kind of inflation would be a part of that, and we have a very talented actuarial team. They use a very sophisticated basket of techniques to come up with the estimate. 
One of them that they use is a multiple regression method that regresses not only over the accident years, the development years but also the calendar years. And that regression over the calendar years makes an explicit estimation of inflation effects. 
And so I thought it was important that Mike pointed out that while the total reserve has been increasing much more than the earned premium or our proxy for exposure. Within that increase, the IBNR was up significantly. The IBNR for casualty over that period of time was up 49%; the auto, up 158%. And if you think about it, we like, most people, that IBNR component has a provision for both the development on case incurred losses, which our claims department does a great job of estimating, and those are claims that have actually been reported and we put an estimate on it. So within that IBNR, there's a good bit of -- for pure IBNR, pure incurred but not reported claims. And so I think a lot of the inflationary effects, no matter how we described them, would be in those ones that we really don't know about yet. The incurred but not reporting. And I think over the history of our company, we've just really done a good job of being prudent in terms of estimating the total reserve. And I think this increase in IBNR that we've had over a period of time has put us really in a good position. I think it's manifested in now 29 years in a row that we've had our reserves developed favorably, and we really just think our best to estimate for our lines of business are all in a good position right now. So that's part of it. That's the reserving part of your question, I think. 
And I think that that's an important part of it because you don't want to have to be paying for adverse development on prior years. So we feel we're in a good position in terms of our current reserves. 
On the pricing side of it, again, and I might ask Steve Spray to contribute a bit here too. But I think between where we estimate the loss cost trends and where we think we're getting rate. And when we throw in that rate, we really throw in the contribution of the segmentation that we're doing in terms of not treating every risk the same. We're really differentiating, segmenting, treating each risk on its own merits. And so we are -- we feel good about our position in commercial casualty. If you take just the overall commercial expense ratio of 32% and add it to either our accident year or x-cat, loss ratio or the calendar year, and we're under 100. And so we feel both on the reserve side and on the property or on the pricing and underwriting side, we're in a good spot too."

And I guess, I think, I've tried to ask this in previous quarter just because there's a number of moving parts, and it's -- workers comps are meaningful beneficiary and the -- to earnings mostly from reserve releases. But the top line is coming down a lot and the underlying loss ratio is deteriorating. 
So is that trend mostly due to decreases in pricing? And on the other hand, what's causing so much of reserve releases to come out. Is it both severity and frequency are better, or is it mostly more recent accident years or the older accident years? Any color would be helpful."

On the reserving said, I'll touch on that, and then Steve Spray will touch on the pricing side. But on the reserving side, we -- whenever we set these, we set our reserves with certain assumptions as to inflation settlement practices in all the data that we can look at. And basically what's been happening with the workers compensation is, and I think it's a real team effort around here in terms of every area of the company contributing, particularly our claims department, our underwriting department, the pricing department. The actuals have just been coming in underneath what we said is our expectation for the reserve development. 
So it's just been a matter of actuals comparing favorable to what we put in in terms of the expectation. And you have to be careful with setting those expectations. I'm sure you know in the workers comp, longtail line, a lot of the trends have been favorable over time but you have to be careful to keep an eye out for any turning points that there might be. And again, we take a prudent approach to the reserving of all lines. 
And Steve, you might want to comment on the pricing."

Our field reps, our renewal underwriters are working with our agents on work comp pricing, making sure that our risk selection's where it needs to be that we're getting the right rate. Of all of our lines, commercial lines, lines of business, the new business is really only off in 2 lines, workers compensation and professional liability. Professional liability is a much smaller segment. But I think it shows the discipline we have in risk selection and in pricing on the work comp book. 
Just looking at the -- as Steve talked about the segmentation, specifically the workers compensation, and we use the analytics and the tools that we have there. We still feel good about our overall pricing of that book of business, but it's no doubt the accident year results are under pressure from the base rate declines."

The majority of that book, about 88% of it, is really traditional casualty business, albeit a little tougher, all right? So it might be -- well, inherently it's going to be a risk that is not eligible for the admitted market. As an example, you might have a borrowed tab and the admitted market doesn't feel that it can get the proper terms and conditions or pricing, so that would end up in the E&S market. 
Where I think our difference is, and why we are outperforming the industry on our E&S operation is we've stuck to our knitting, like I said before, the underwriters, the entire team has been consistent in their appetite in terms, conditions and the pricing. And the value proposition we have for our agents and the policyholders and their community is different. The traditional E&S route is for a retail agent to go to the wholesale market, and then the wholesale market go to the broader E&S carriers. 
We've formed our own brokerage, our underwriters are employees of the brokerage, our agents have direct access to the decision-makers in our E&S company. 
The other big thing is, now there's a several of them. But we gave our agents, I think more confidence on that E&S business because we use all the local resources of Cincinnati Insurance company to bear with our E&S company as well. Most importantly, our claims operation. So our agents have a relationship with that local claims adjuster that will handle both the admitted market business as well as the nonadmitted. We run our brokerage lean and mean. We can return more of the commission to our agents. And on top of that, we include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the Cincinnati Insurance company overall profit sharing arrangements. So we're aligned with our agents but they send us business that they feel is going to perform better than maybe some other E&S might."

We have had consistent average net rate change that we've reported over the last several quarters. But that doesn't tell the full story. What we're really trying to execute. And I think we're doing a great job in all segments. At the underwriting level working with our agents is focused on segmentation. We're really focused on retaining the most profitable business, the business that we feel we have an opportunity to have a better margin. We are really focused on getting larger rate that's needed on that business that we feel is less apt to drive a profit for us. And our retention spreads look really good there as well. So we are retaining more of that -- more profitable business. We're either getting rate or we're losing some of that business to the market, and we're comfortable with that. It's changing our mix, and I think it's -- you're seeing it in our results. 
Now that's primarily, what I'm talking about there is commercial lines. The same story is going on in personal lines. You can see it in our auto results. We continue to improve our sophistication on pricing both on the auto, in home. That continues to evolve. It's good now but that's going to continue to get better. And as everybody is reporting, you're seeing better personal auto results, and we're seeing that as well. But there is certainly some variability and volatility going on in the homeowner book and we've seen that as well. 
And the good news there is we feel like we're in a positive rate environment on homeowner, and we think the runaway is long, and will continue that will serve everybody well and it's needed. Our E&S company has continued to get low single-digit rate even with the levels of profit that they've generated. They've gotten low single-digit rate quarter over quarter over quarter for quite a while. 
So that really sums up the way we look at rate, and the way we look at execution, the way we work day-to-day with our agents, Paul."

We really saw back in 2016 is where we really took a sense of urgency and started taking serious action on the commercial auto book. And again, it goes, to what I mentioned before, we really focused on the segmentation piece of it and risk selection. But just from a pricing standpoint, we really got aggressive starting in 2016, and I really believe that we're out in front of this issue. And the reason I can -- why I measure that is we have such a close relationship with our agents. We have so few of them, you know our distribution model. But we on a daily basis, we're delivering necessary auto rate change back starting in 2016. We were causing considerable pain, and we heard pretty regularly that we were, ""an outlier"" from our agents as far as how hard we were pushing. 
Well, fast forward to fourth quarter '18, really beginning in '19, that pain has really, kind of, gone away. And I think it's because others really started noticing and started taking similar action. So if you look at our x-cat accident year on the commercial auto, it is continuing to improve. We haven't crossed the finish line. Now that loss ratio isn't where we wanted to be.

It's -- right now, it's about 28% of our total personal lines book. It's how we would break out high net worth. When we started really focusing on high net worth, being deliberate about it. A little over 5 years ago, our book was at about $100 million, and it's now approaching $400 million, written premium this year is up over 30% and new business was up about 25% to give you a little flavor there. 
I will tell you that we've got an experienced team. Will Van Den Heuvel leads personal -- leads all personal lines, came to us with 25 years of high net worth experience, has brought nearly 40 people with him who had many years of high net worth experience as well. 
So overnight, we became a 25-year high net worth experienced company. We were deliberate to get into that business because over time, historically, it has outperformed the broader personal lines market. 
Plus we like the value we bring as a company through claims and our coverage forms and all of that. So it was a natural progression for us there. I will tell you that on the homeowner front, from the very beginning as we're growing this business, we fully expected quarter-to-quarter variability. We're writing larger risks that can have larger losses may also bring larger premiums with them, but we have experienced some of that inherent variability. We did in the third quarter this year with some larger losses on high net worth homes as well. 
We've dug in to each one of those. We don't see any trend on geography by agency. You name it. So we think it's, again, it's just inherent variability from quarter-to-quarter, it's expected. We expect it to continue on that front going forward as well. 
Now I think, if you look at the industry, we're seeing many of the competitors are reporting some pain in the high net worth homeowner area as well, and that kind of goes to what I was saying earlier is we think the runaway for rate will remain positive there. And it's going to benefit us as well."

On the other hand, and I've mentioned in the prior calls, bonds that we have lost through maturities or calls, those yields were very high. We bought a lot of corporate bonds 10-year not a call paper during and in the aftermath of the financial crisis. So we've been bleeding fairly good out the back door on yields lost, that seems to be abating now. The worst of that, we feel confident is over. So if we can get the 10-year treasury, for example, up to, let's say, the 2.5% to 3% range. We think we can get some traction on interest income growth. So we -- again, we typically will choose the point on the yield curve that's got the most risk-adjusted, tax adjusted yields and kind of go with that.

The other thing that I would add there is about -- it's between 40% and 50% of the time when we write an E&S, say casualty line, Cincinnati Insurance company is picking up the other lines of business on the admitted side. So it might be a manufacturing concern as an example that has a really tough product liability exposure where our E&S company can underwrite it term, condition and price it appropriately, and then Cincinnati Insurance will write the property, will write the premises liability, the auto workers compensation. So that happens 40% to 50% of the time. So that's driving us more towards casualty as well."

Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We beli",678,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. 
Our operating performance was again strong, and we're making steady progress on profitably growing our insurance business overtime. We believe our improving results reflect our winning strategy and dedication to executing it well. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2019 was very good. Although, it did not match our results from a year ago when changes in the fair value of equity securities represented nearly 2/3 of the total. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up an impressive 31% and is up 26% for the first 9 months of this year. Every segment of our business performed well, and it was nice to see an underwriting profit in each of our property casualty operating units for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. 
Our 94.2% third quarter 2019 property casualty combined ratio was 2.6 percentage points better than a year ago, and it improved 2.7 points on a year-to-date basis. We continue to see benefits from work in recent years to diversify risk by product line and geography. We also are pleased with results from ongoing segmentation of risks, retaining more profitable accounts and getting better pricing on less profitable business. That gives us increasing confidence to decline opportunities when we determine profit margins are unsatisfactory. 
We also benefit from having outstanding independent insurance agents, representing the company. They understand how to communicate value to their clients, and they continue to produce more premium revenues for us as we earn a larger share of their business. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 8%, including renewal price increases and healthy growth in new business written premiums. 
The commercial lines segment's third quarter 2019 estimated average price increases were similar to the low single-digit percentage increases of the second quarter. The combined ratio for commercial lines was 2.5 percentage points better than the third quarter a year ago and 1.8 points better on a year-to-date basis. Our personal lines segment also continued to experience average rate increases similar to the second quarter of 2019.  
We're encouraged by 2 consecutive quarters with the personal lines underwriting profit, and believe we are well-positioned for profitable growth in the future. Our excess and surplus lines segment continues to perform very well, including a third quarter combined ratio below 85% and net written premium growth of 25%. Cincinnati Re continues to perform as planned with the year-to-date combined ratio in the low 90s. Cincinnati Global experienced a very profitable quarter and has a post-acquisition combined ratio in the low 80s, including some favorable effects of purchase accounting for the first few periods following an acquisition. 
Our life insurance subsidiary continued to grow its business with third quarter term life insurance premiums up 12% on an earned basis. While as net income contribution was not as strong as last year, Cincinnati Life provides valuable diversification to our insurance risks and our earnings. More importantly, agents appreciate the ability to add life insurance solutions for their clients, all under the Cincinnati umbrella. Our investment performance also continues to be outstanding. Investment income continues to grow and our equity portfolio during the first 3 quarters of this year has outperformed the S&P 500. 
I'll wrap up with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Improving operating results and favorable securities markets resulted in a third quarter VCR of 3.6%, boosting the 9-month measure to 22.8%, well above our targeted annual average of 10% to 13%. The contribution from our operations measured as net income before investment gains was 6.3% for the first 9 months of 2019, up 0.9 percentage points from a year ago. 
While our equity portfolio supported our healthy VCR, we understand the risk of short-term variability due to market effects. We believe its potential for long-term appreciation is important for creating value for shareholders over time. 
Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will share insights on other important areas of our financial results."

Our investment income rose again, up 5% for the third quarter of 2019 before income tax effects. Dividend growth from our equity portfolio was 11% as dividend rates have increased for many of our holdings. Net purchases of stocks during the third quarter totaled $77 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio declined slightly from the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.03% for the third quarter, down 16 basis points from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to invest in bonds with third quarter net purchases of $208 million. As we reported in our 10-Q, the average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds was roughly 60 basis points lower than the same period in 2018, so interest income may continue to be pressured. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2019 were again favorable for both our stock and bond portfolios. The overall net gain was $186 million before tax effects. That included $89 million for equity portfolio and $99 million for our bond portfolio. 
We ended the quarter with net appreciated value of $4.2 billion, including $3.6 billion in our equity portfolio. Cash flow remained strong and fueled investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities generated $880 million for the first 9 months of 2019, up 7% or $54 million, even after paying $114 million more this year in catastrophe losses. Another important area for management is balancing expense controls with strategic investments to aid in the profitable growth of our business. 
The third quarter 2019 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.3 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter. But on a 9-month basis, it matched the average of full years 2016 through 2018. Regarding reserving, doing so carefully is imperative. We aim for a consistent approach as we target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the third quarter 2019, we experienced a satisfactory amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. Favorable reserve development for the quarter benefit our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points. 
On a year-to-date, all lines basis by accident year, it included 33% for accident year 2018, 27% for accident year 2017 and 40% for 2016 and prior accident years. Regardless of weather, the root cause of particular changes and loss control trends is from social inflation or other matters, we do our best to establish adequate reserves. For example, we have disclosed that since the end of 2015, we've increased our commercial casualty total loss reserves by $324 million or 26%. 
The IBNR component of that total is up $220 million or 49%. During the same period, annualized earned premiums, one way to estimate the change in insured exposure is up only 8%. For commercial auto, total loss reserves are up 44% with the IBNR component up 158%, while earned premiums are up 25%. 
Turning to managing capital, another critical function for the company. Our approach remains stable. Our financial strength is excellent as is our financial flexibility. As usual, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.40. Life insurance operations added $0.08. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.62. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.48. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.43, and we declared $0.56 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.45 during the third quarter to a record high, $57.37 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Does that indicate that you potentially are seeing a rise in loss inflation trends? 
I don't know your view there. Are you guys seeing any changes, some of your competitors, the larger ones, have said that they are seeing an increase in trend? And they also pointed out that they're getting more pricing, so maybe you could comment on that."
260681,639175782,1842795,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2019",2019-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Mike.

But last year was actually one of the",635,"Okay. Thanks, Mike. And that does seem to be the question of this earning season. As we look at the paid-to-incurred ratios, the paid -- as you mentioned, the paid to incurred this year is a bit higher than last year. But last year was actually one of the lowest paid incurred that we had. So if we look at it more over the long term, we think we've addressed our reserving position in casualty, commercial auto and really all the lines very consistently over time. And I think I break it down, going back to 2015, 2016 as Mike pointed out in his conference call. 
We look at inflation in total. So social inflation or any other kind of inflation would be a part of that, and we have a very talented actuarial team. They use a very sophisticated basket of techniques to come up with the estimate. 
One of them that they use is a multiple regression method that regresses not only over the accident years, the development years but also the calendar years. And that regression over the calendar years makes an explicit estimation of inflation effects. 
And so I thought it was important that Mike pointed out that while the total reserve has been increasing much more than the earned premium or our proxy for exposure. Within that increase, the IBNR was up significantly. The IBNR for casualty over that period of time was up 49%; the auto, up 158%. And if you think about it, we like, most people, that IBNR component has a provision for both the development on case incurred losses, which our claims department does a great job of estimating, and those are claims that have actually been reported and we put an estimate on it. So within that IBNR, there's a good bit of -- for pure IBNR, pure incurred but not reported claims. And so I think a lot of the inflationary effects, no matter how we described them, would be in those ones that we really don't know about yet. The incurred but not reporting. And I think over the history of our company, we've just really done a good job of being prudent in terms of estimating the total reserve. And I think this increase in IBNR that we've had over a period of time has put us really in a good position. I think it's manifested in now 29 years in a row that we've had our reserves developed favorably, and we really just think our best to estimate for our lines of business are all in a good position right now. So that's part of it. That's the reserving part of your question, I think. 
And I think that that's an important part of it because you don't want to have to be paying for adverse development on prior years. So we feel we're in a good position in terms of our current reserves. 
On the pricing side of it, again, and I might ask Steve Spray to contribute a bit here too. But I think between where we estimate the loss cost trends and where we think we're getting rate. And when we throw in that rate, we really throw in the contribution of the segmentation that we're doing in terms of not treating every risk the same. We're really differentiating, segmenting, treating each risk on its own merits. And so we are -- we feel good about our position in commercial casualty. If you take just the overall commercial expense ratio of 32% and add it to either our accident year or x-cat, loss ratio or the calendar year, and we're under 100. And so we feel both on the reserve side and on the property or on the pricing and underwriting side, we're in a good spot too."

And I guess, I think, I've tried to ask this in previous quarter just because there's a number of moving parts, and it's -- workers comps are meaningful beneficiary and the -- to earnings mostly from reserve releases. But the top line is coming down a lot and the underlying loss ratio is deteriorating. 
So is that trend mostly due to decreases in pricing? And on the other hand, what's causing so much of reserve releases to come out. Is it both severity and frequency are better, or is it mostly more recent accident years or the older accident years? Any color would be helpful."

On the reserving said, I'll touch on that, and then Steve Spray will touch on the pricing side. But on the reserving side, we -- whenever we set these, we set our reserves with certain assumptions as to inflation settlement practices in all the data that we can look at. And basically what's been happening with the workers compensation is, and I think it's a real team effort around here in terms of every area of the company contributing, particularly our claims department, our underwriting department, the pricing department. The actuals have just been coming in underneath what we said is our expectation for the reserve development. 
So it's just been a matter of actuals comparing favorable to what we put in in terms of the expectation. And you have to be careful with setting those expectations. I'm sure you know in the workers comp, longtail line, a lot of the trends have been favorable over time but you have to be careful to keep an eye out for any turning points that there might be. And again, we take a prudent approach to the reserving of all lines.

Our field reps, our renewal underwriters are working with our agents on work comp pricing, making sure that our risk selection's where it needs to be that we're getting the right rate. Of all of our lines, commercial lines, lines of business, the new business is really only off in 2 lines, workers compensation and professional liability. Professional liability is a much smaller segment. But I think it shows the discipline we have in risk selection and in pricing on the work comp book. 
Just looking at the -- as Steve talked about the segmentation, specifically the workers compensation, and we use the analytics and the tools that we have there. We still feel good about our overall pricing of that book of business, but it's no doubt the accident year results are under pressure from the base rate declines."

The majority of that book, about 88% of it, is really traditional casualty business, albeit a little tougher, all right? So it might be -- well, inherently it's going to be a risk that is not eligible for the admitted market. As an example, you might have a borrowed tab and the admitted market doesn't feel that it can get the proper terms and conditions or pricing, so that would end up in the E&S market. 
Where I think our difference is, and why we are outperforming the industry on our E&S operation is we've stuck to our knitting, like I said before, the underwriters, the entire team has been consistent in their appetite in terms, conditions and the pricing. And the value proposition we have for our agents and the policyholders and their community is different. The traditional E&S route is for a retail agent to go to the wholesale market, and then the wholesale market go to the broader E&S carriers. 
We've formed our own brokerage, our underwriters are employees of the brokerage, our agents have direct access to the decision-makers in our E&S company. 
The other big thing is, now there's a several of them. But we gave our agents, I think more confidence on that E&S business because we use all the local resources of Cincinnati Insurance company to bear with our E&S company as well. Most importantly, our claims operation. So our agents have a relationship with that local claims adjuster that will handle both the admitted market business as well as the nonadmitted. We run our brokerage lean and mean. We can return more of the commission to our agents. And on top of that, we include the premium and losses from our E&S company into the Cincinnati Insurance company overall profit sharing arrangements. So we're aligned with our agents but they send us business that they feel is going to perform better than maybe some other E&S might."

We have had consistent average net rate change that we've reported over the last several quarters. But that doesn't tell the full story. What we're really trying to execute. And I think we're doing a great job in all segments. At the underwriting level working with our agents is focused on segmentation. We're really focused on retaining the most profitable business, the business that we feel we have an opportunity to have a better margin. We are really focused on getting larger rate that's needed on that business that we feel is less apt to drive a profit for us. And our retention spreads look really good there as well. So we are retaining more of that -- more profitable business. We're either getting rate or we're losing some of that business to the market, and we're comfortable with that. It's changing our mix, and I think it's -- you're seeing it in our results. 
Now that's primarily, what I'm talking about there is commercial lines. The same story is going on in personal lines. You can see it in our auto results. We continue to improve our sophistication on pricing both on the auto, in home. That continues to evolve. It's good now but that's going to continue to get better. And as everybody is reporting, you're seeing better personal auto results, and we're seeing that as well. But there is certainly some variability and volatility going on in the homeowner book and we've seen that as well. 
And the good news there is we feel like we're in a positive rate environment on homeowner, and we think the runaway is long, and will continue that will serve everybody well and it's needed. Our E&S company has continued to get low single-digit rate even with the levels of profit that they've generated. They've gotten low single-digit rate quarter over quarter over quarter for quite a while. 
So that really sums up the way we look at rate, and the way we look at execution, the way we work day-to-day with our agents, Paul."

I lived this real time. So I think I can speak to it. This is Steve Spray. 
We really saw back in 2016 is where we really took a sense of urgency and started taking serious action on the commercial auto book. And again, it goes, to what I mentioned before, we really focused on the segmentation piece of it and risk selection. But just from a pricing standpoint, we really got aggressive starting in 2016, and I really believe that we're out in front of this issue. And the reason I can -- why I measure that is we have such a close relationship with our agents. We have so few of them, you know our distribution model. But we on a daily basis, we're delivering necessary auto rate change back starting in 2016. We were causing considerable pain, and we heard pretty regularly that we were, ""an outlier"" from our agents as far as how hard we were pushing. 
Well, fast forward to fourth quarter '18, really beginning in '19, that pain has really, kind of, gone away. And I think it's because others really started noticing and started taking similar action. So if you look at our x-cat accident year on the commercial auto, it is continuing to improve. We haven't crossed the finish line. Now that loss ratio isn't where we wanted to be.

It's -- right now, it's about 28% of our total personal lines book. It's how we would break out high net worth. When we started really focusing on high net worth, being deliberate about it. A little over 5 years ago, our book was at about $100 million, and it's now approaching $400 million, written premium this year is up over 30% and new business was up about 25% to give you a little flavor there. 
I will tell you that we've got an experienced team. Will Van Den Heuvel leads personal -- leads all personal lines, came to us with 25 years of high net worth experience, has brought nearly 40 people with him who had many years of high net worth experience as well. 
So overnight, we became a 25-year high net worth experienced company. We were deliberate to get into that business because over time, historically, it has outperformed the broader personal lines market. 
Plus we like the value we bring as a company through claims and our coverage forms and all of that. So it was a natural progression for us there. I will tell you that on the homeowner front, from the very beginning as we're growing this business, we fully expected quarter-to-quarter variability. We're writing larger risks that can have larger losses may also bring larger premiums with them, but we have experienced some of that inherent variability. We did in the third quarter this year with some larger losses on high net worth homes as well. 
We've dug in to each one of those. We don't see any trend on geography by agency. You name it. So we think it's, again, it's just inherent variability from quarter-to-quarter, it's expected. We expect it to continue on that front going forward as well. 
Now I think, if you look at the industry, we're seeing many of the competitors are reporting some pain in the high net worth homeowner area as well, and that kind of goes to what I was saying earlier is we think the runaway for rate will remain positive there. And it's going to benefit us as well."

On the other hand, and I've mentioned in the prior calls, bonds that we have lost through maturities or calls, those yields were very high. We bought a lot of corporate bonds 10-year not a call paper during and in the aftermath of the financial crisis. So we've been bleeding fairly good out the back door on yields lost, that seems to be abating now. The worst of that, we feel confident is over. So if we can get the 10-year treasury, for example, up to, let's say, the 2.5% to 3% range. We think we can get some traction on interest income growth. So we -- again, we typically will choose the point on the yield curve that's got the most risk-adjusted, tax adjusted yields and kind of go with that.

And just to give you a little flavor of what the book looks like, it's -- our average premium size for the general liability on E&S is just a little over $6,000. So certainly on the small end, our limits profile there, 80% of our limits are $3 million or less. So kind of gives you a feel for that too. The other thing that I would add there is about -- it's between 40% and 50% of the time when we write an E&S, say casualty line, Cincinnati Insurance company is picking up the other lines of business on the admitted side. So it might be a manufacturing concern as an example that has a really tough product liability exposure where our E&S company can underwrite it term, condition and price it appropriately, and then Cincinnati Insurance will write the property, will write the premises liability, the auto workers compensation. So that happens 40% to 50% of the time. So that's driving us more towards casualty as well."
