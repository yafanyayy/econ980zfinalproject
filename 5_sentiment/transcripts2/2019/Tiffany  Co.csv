Mark Erceg and I will address these results in a broad sense and as they pertain to our key strategic priorities. And then, we will allow plenty of time for your questions. 
The specific details of our financial results can be found in today's news release and 10-K filing. 
Broadly speaking, I'm pleased with Tiffany's annual results in 2018 and with what our global team accomplished. 
For the full year, sales rose in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe, and increased in most product categories, and we were encouraged to experience higher sales attributed to local customers in the full year, even though sales attributed to foreign tourists were volatile. 
As you know our sales growth decelerated in the second half. We can talk about external factors that benefited as in the first half and then went against us in the second half. But I believe it is more productive to focus on the journey that we started exactly one year ago, when we presented to you our [ 6 ] strategic priorities as well as our decision to increase investments spending in several areas to support sustainable, long-term growth. And we made substantial progress in the past year and a lot is going to happen in 2019. 
Our strategy to amplify and evolve the brand message was highlighted with both the messaging in the ""Believing Love"", ""Believe in Dreams"" and holiday campaigns. These campaigns came as a pleasant surprise to our audience and signaled that something new and exciting was starting to happen at Tiffany. 
I'm pleased that as a result, sales growth in 2018 came from our existing customer base as well as from new customers, and former customers who have not shopped at Tiffany in a number of years. 
Then since January 2019, we have strengthened our message on diamonds. Hashtag Tiffany diamond that they campaign on social media. Our leading innovation of providing to customers the country or region of origin of our individually registered diamonds and the enormous visibility of the legendary 128 carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond with Lady Gaga at the Oscars are a synchronized [indiscernible] of the beauty, traceability and glamor of our superlative Tiffany diamonds. 
Another strategies to renew our product offering and factor base, in 2018 we unveiled the PAPER FLOWERS jewelry line, introduced new [indiscernible] expansions of existing collections, made a significant investment in high jewelry inventory to be a more powerful assortment in some of our key locations around the world, and we began to offer expensive customization through the [ Make it My Tiffany product ]. 
For holiday 2018, we launched in the U.S. a limited assortment of the TIFFANY TRUE collection. We are now excited to rollout the launch of the TIFFANY TRUE solitaire and the boldy designed jewelry in all the regions and with increasing new styles throughout 2019. 
For our priority to deliver an exciting customer experience, in 2018, we expanded Tiffany's true presence with the opening of 10 stores in high potential markets around the world, while we're locating a number of existing stores and closing 4 stores, for a net increase of 6 stores. 
And of course, we announced the bold initiative to transform our New Year flagship store into an exciting 21st century retailer experience by the end of 2021. 
In 2019, we will have some important openings in key cities. 
We just completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, a significant market for Tiffany. It's a beautiful store in Sydney at the corner of Pip and King streets that has surprised customers, press and the entire industry for his stylish aesthetics, imposing size and refine experience. 
And next week, we will celebrate the grand opening of our newest location in the U.S., the -- our first store in Washington, D.C. in city center and new luxury destination for local customers and tourists. 
We plan to announce other important new stores in key markets such as in Greater China during the course of the year. 
In addition to opening new stores, we are also holding our presentations within existing stores through our fresh and innovative global display announcement initiative in North America, which we are now pleased to extend in 2019 to the rest of the world. 
In terms of delivering a more exciting omni-channel experience, we are now up driving our website globally, which provides a number of benefits to both the consumer experience and Tiffany's ability to innovate. 
We are offering a rich blended experience of content and commerce, elevating the brand, while reducing the friction in the users journey as much as possible. 
The enhancements give Tiffany more agility in testing, personalizing and content optimization. 
For example, on our U.S. website, we have just begun offselling for sale select love and engagement diamond rings online. These clients can now filter available inventory for purchase on tiffany.com in addition to consulting a diamond expert to find the perfect ring. 
In recent years, Tiffany has been accepting phone orders for diamond rings from customers beyond our store distribution, so we believe this is a natural and complementary expansion of our in-store experience for the love and engagement category. 
And we look forward to a process of continued improvement in our digital capabilities going forward, including plans to introduce a company operated e-commerce enabled website in China later this year. 
In summary, we are feeling the early stages of the long and exciting journey that I referred to one year ago. The Tiffany brand is increasingly recognizing the size, our talented organization is aligned with our strategic priorities, and is getting more proactive and agile every day. 
I believe that the long term outlook is very promising. I will now turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve with just a little over one year ago we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities, fiscal 201",755,"Thanks, Alex. From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve with just a little over one year ago we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities, fiscal 2018 would be an investment year. 
Since Alex has already commented on our sales performance, let me say just a few words about earnings from operations, diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. 
You will recall us stating that fiscal 2018 operating earnings were expected to be flat to slightly down in order to fund meaningful investments across a number of areas we felt were essential to support sustainable, long-term mid single-digit sales growth. 
Consistent with that, earnings from operations came in at $790 million versus $809 million during fiscal 2017, a decline of approximately 2%. 
We also passed along significant benefits associated with U.S. tax reform, specifically, we started the year expecting an overall 2018 effective tax rate somewhere in the high [ 20s ] and as more information became available and we completed our analysis, we ultimately ended the year just a fraction over 21%. 
While our 2018 effective tax rate did include some onetime benefits not directly associated with the lower U.S. statutory tax rate, a lower effective tax rate was the primary driver that allowed us to finish the year with diluted net EPS at $4.75 per share, which was towards the higher end of the last guidance range we provided, a $4.65 to $4.80 per share and well above our initial fiscal 2018 guidance of being somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per share. 
Finally, we started the year projecting approximately $380 million of free cash flow and after revising our projections to account for higher inventory levels, including for high jewelry and increased cash payments from income taxes related to U.S. tax reform, we ended the year at $250 million of free cash flow. 
So in total, and across our key financial performance indicators of sales growth, operating earnings, net earnings and free cash flow, I think it is fair to say we delivered what we set out to achieve. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the year with $855 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus roughly $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This means that after spending more than $400 million to purchase shares of our common stock, and after increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 10%, which was a [ 17th ] increase in the past 16 years, our balance sheet remains a major source of strength and flexibility. 
In terms of our outlook for 2019, we are maintaining the preliminary guidance we provided on January 18 when we reported holiday sales results. 
Low single digit sales growth for the full year as reported and slightly higher on a constant exchange rate basis and a mid single-digit increase and diluted EPS. 
It's worth noting that our forecast for mid single EPS growth and our expectation of modest operating margin expansion includes a number of unique factors, first, incremental SG&A expense related to the New York flagship store project, which was $0.07 per share in 2018 is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
Second, our 2019 forecasts accounts for the fact that we will no longer be able to recognize an $8 million a year deferred gain on previous sale-leaseback's due to a new accounting standard. 
Finally, we expect an all-in effective income tax rate of approximately 23% in 2019, which is roughly 200 basis points higher than fiscal 2018. 
From a timing standpoint and consistent with January results, while we expect full year reported sales to grow by a low single-digit percentage, we expect sales in the first half to be adversely affected by several factors. A meaningful FX headwind, lower foreign tourist spending and a difficult comparison to strong base period comps. 
In addition to these items, first half earnings will also be negatively affected by incremental strategic investment spending that began in the second quarter of 2018 and has not yet fully annualized. 
We anticipate that these pressures will lessen throughout the year and as additional new products are introduced, our marketing message continues to resonate and our in-store experience becomes even stronger, we expect reported sales growth to strengthen and earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year. 
That wraps up my brief remarks. So I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

As far as what happens in any given quarter on gross margin, I don't think that's overly helpful to unpack. There's always mix effect, there is many number of things that can fall in that and of course, our sales growth in the fourth quarter was lower than balance of the year and so there's going to less fixed cost leverage even through the COGS line. As far as SG&A is concerned, I think one of the things that we've talked about a lot in the past is the need to ensure that our cost take out programs are robust and strong and that takes a little bit of time to gear up, so to the extent that SG&A growth in the fourth quarter was lower than you might've seen throughout the year, I think that's a positive indicator and as we think about the guidance we provided for 2019, we're basically saying that we're going to an operating margin expansion on low single digit sales growth. So I think again our cost takeout programs continue to ramp up and I think you're seeing some of that in the fourth quarter at this point."

So we are working on it, going ahead, but we were not perfect. We have done a lot, a lot of new things, also things were we had made some mistakes, we are learning, and we are addressing it.

There is a clear divide in the year between first half and second half and PAPER FLOWERS were launched in mid 2018, and you have been through a lot of marketing, branding, in-store experience, remodeling. So I was wondering what your incremental, let's say, comments could be in terms of how to drive growth irrespective of favorable top down trends, given that so much had been done with impact in the second half, rather than the first half? And the second question is a follow-up on SG&A. The fact that leverage seems to be so much better and the combination of efficiencies and gross margin seem to be affecting some of what we thought were going to be higher investment needs. Is this leaving you in a comfortable position when the luxury framework is becoming very competitive and using deep pockets to fuel the visibility of the competing brands?

We try not to distinguish, again, the whole lot between gross margin expansion, SG&A margin expansion. At the end of the day, it's all about operating margin expansion, in this past year, we clearly, stated that we expect operating margin to be down and it was for the year that we just provided guidance for, we expect it to be up modestly and our long term algorithms still would suggest that we would expect to see about a 50 basis point improvement in margin thereafter and that's still what we're working in. As far as the answer your question on the flagships store, this past year, we had about $0.07 of the dilution, related to that, we said for next year, it would be somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15. It's not driven by an expectation of sales disruption, it really comes down to a number of things, it's the incremental rent for the temporary space, it's the accelerated depreciation, a shift associated with the project itself because now that we're transforming elements of the existing store, we need to depreciate and accelerate the depreciation over now and when the project will go live and then there are certain expense dollars related to some consultants and others that really can't be capitalized, those are the 3 elements that come into play as it relates to that but we don't expect a sales disruption in that map."

We stood this up this past year in China and 7 other Asia Pacific countries, as I intimated earlier, that's one of the reasons that we can now support a Chinese Tiffany enabled website because we now have the ability to provide that product to the customer's through those new portals. We're going to continue to stand up additional geographies as we go forward as it relates to that endeavor, it will continue to take a number of years though between now and when we get the entire world stood up on that system. Second thing we always talked about was our digitally platforming and if you get a chance to look at our new website, which we just stood up this week, I think you'll see a dramatic step forward in the capabilities of the site. We've obviously done very well in the past with our e-commerce portals. We won a lot of awards, a lot of that frankly was through sheer force of will and just the dedication of the team, but they didn't have the proper tools to really allow them to do a lot of the things that we'll now be able to do from a clienteling from that reach standpoint, from an [ AV ] testing standpoint and so we're now well underway on our digitally platforming and once we get the China e-com site up later this year that will be a big step forward.

So I think it's still early to assess, also because especially, for diamond rings and engagement rings, the decision process of the customer is very long, typically, it takes several months and several interactions with that brand on the website in the stores et cetera before making a decision.

The specific details of our financial results can be found in today's news release and 10-K filing. 
Broadly speaking, I'm pleased with Tiffany's annual results in 2018 and with what our global team accomplished. For the full year, sales rose in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe and increased in most product categories, and we were encouraged to experience higher sales attributed to local customers in the full year even though sales attributed to foreign tourists were volatile. 
As you know our sales growth decelerated in the second half. We can talk about external factors that benefited us in the first half and then went against us in the second half. But I believe it is more productive to focus on the journey that we started exactly 1 year ago, when we presented to you our 6 strategic priorities as well as our decision to increase investment spending in several areas to support sustainable long-term growth. And we made substantial progress in the past year and a lot is going to happen in 2019. 
Our strategy to amplify and evolve the brand message was highlighted with bolder messaging in the BELIEVE IN LOVE, ""Believe in Dreams"" and holiday campaigns. These campaigns came as a pleasant surprise to our audience and signaled that something new and exciting was starting to happen at Tiffany. 
I am pleased that as a result, sales growth in 2018 came from our existing customer base as well as from new customers and former customers who have not shopped at Tiffany in a number of years. 
Then since January 2019, we have strengthened our message on diamonds. A #ATiffanyDiamondADay campaign on social media. Our leading innovation of providing to customers the country or region of origin of our individually registered diamonds and the enormous visibility of the legendary 128 carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond with Lady Gaga at the Oscars are a synchronized ascertain of the beauty, traceability and glamour of our superlative Tiffany diamonds. 
Another strategy is to renew our product offering, set a faster pace, and in 2018 we unveiled the PAPER FLOWERS jewelry line, introduced numerous extensions of existing collections, made a significant investment in high jewelry inventory to build a more powerful assortment in some of our key locations around the world. And we began to offer expensive jewelry customizations through the Make It My Tiffany program.
For holiday 2018, we launched in the U.S. a limited assortment of the TIFFANY TRUE collection. We are now excited to rollout the launch of the TIFFANY TRUE solitaire and the boldly designed jewelry in all the regions and with increasing new styles throughout 2019. 
For our priority to deliver an exciting customer experience, in 2018, we expanded Tiffany's store presence with the opening of 10 stores in high potential markets around the world, while relocating a number of existing stores and closing 4 stores for a net increase of 6 stores. 
And of course, we announced the bold initiative to transform our New York flagship store into an exciting 21st century retail experience by the end of 2021. 
In 2019, we will have some important openings in key cities. We just completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, a significant market for Tiffany. It's a beautiful store in Sydney at the corner of Pitt and King Streets that has surprised customers, press and the entire industry for its stylish aesthetics, imposing size and refined experience. And next week, we will celebrate the grand opening of our newest location in the U.S., the first -- our first store in Washington, D.C. In city center CityCenterDc, a new luxury destination for local customers and tourists. 
We plan to announce other important new stores in key markets, such as in Greater China, during the course of the year. In addition to opening new stores, we are also evolving our presentations within existing stores through our fresh and innovative global display announcement initiatives in North America, which we are now pleased to extend in 2019 to the rest of the world. 
In terms of delivering a more exciting omnichannel experience, we are now upgrading our websites globally, which provides a number of benefits to both the consumer experience and Tiffany's ability to innovate. We are offering a rich, blended experience of content and commerce, elevating the brand, while reducing the friction in the user's journey as much as possible. The enhancements give Tiffany more agility in testing, personalizing and content optimization. 
For example, on our U.S. website, we have just begun offering for sale select love and engagement diamond rings online. U.S. clients can now filter available inventory for purchase on tiffany.com in addition to consulting a diamond expert to find the perfect ring. 
In recent years, Tiffany has been accepting phone orders for diamond rings from customers surely beyond our store distribution, so we believe this is a natural and complementary expansion of our in-store experience for the love and engagement category. And we look forward to a process of continuous improvement in our digital capabilities going forward, including plans to introduce a company-operated, e-commerce-enabled website in China later this year. 
In summary, we are still in the early stages of the long and exciting journey that I referred to 1 year ago. The Tiffany brand is increasingly recognizing the size, our talented organization is aligned with our strategic priorities and is getting more proactive and agile every day. 
I believe that the long-term outlook is very promising. I will now turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve with just a little over 1 year ago, we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities fiscal 2018",749,"Thanks, Alex. From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve with just a little over 1 year ago, we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities fiscal 2018 would be an investment year. 
Since Alex has already commented on our sales performance, let me say just a few words about earnings from operations, diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. 
You will recall us stating that fiscal 2018 operating earnings were expected to be flat to slightly down in order to fund meaningful investments across a number of areas we felt were essential to support sustainable, long-term, mid-single-digit sales growth. Consistent with that, earnings from operations came in at $790 million versus $809 million during fiscal 2017, a decline of approximately 2%. 
We also passed along significant benefits associated with U.S. tax reform. Specifically, we started the year expecting an overall 2018 effective tax rate somewhere in the high 20s and as more information became available and we completed our analysis, we ultimately ended the year just a fraction over 21%. 
While our 2018 effective tax rate did include some onetime benefits not directly associated with the lower U.S. statutory tax rate, a lower effective tax rate was the primary driver that allowed us to finish the year with diluted net EPS at $4.75 per share, which was towards the higher end of the last guidance range we provided of $4.65 to $4.80 per share, and well above our initial fiscal 2018 guidance of being somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per share. 
Finally, we started the year projecting approximately $380 million of free cash flow and after revising our projections to account for higher inventory levels, including for high jewelry and increased cash payments from income taxes related to U.S. tax reform, we ended the year at $250 million of free cash flow. 
So in total, and across our key financial performance indicators of sales growth, operating earnings, net earnings and free cash flow, I think it is fair to say we delivered what we set out to achieve. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the year with $855 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus roughly $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This means that after spending more than $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and after increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 10%, which was a 17th increase in the past 16 years, our balance sheet remains a major source of strength and flexibility. 
In terms of our outlook for 2019, we are maintaining the preliminary guidance we provided on January 18 when we reported holiday sales results. Low single digit sales growth for the full year as reported and slightly higher on a constant exchange-rate basis and a mid-single-digit increase and diluted EPS. 
It's worth noting that our forecast for mid-single EPS growth and our expectation of modest operating margin expansion includes a number of unique factors. First, incremental SG&A expense related to the New York flagship store project, which was $0.07 per share in 2018 is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Second, our 2019 forecast accounts for the fact that we will no longer be able to recognize an $8 million a year deferred gain on previous sale leasebacks, due to a new accounting standard. Finally, we expect an all-in effective income tax rate of approximately 23% in 2019, which is roughly 200 basis points higher than fiscal 2018. 
From a timing standpoint and consistent with January results, while we expect full year reported sales to grow by a low single digit percentage, we expect sales in the first half to be adversely affected by several factors. A meaningful FX headwind, lower foreign tourist spending and a difficult comparison to strong base period comps. In addition to these items, first half earnings will also be negatively affected by incremental strategic investment spending that began in the second quarter of 2018 and has not yet fully annualized. 
We anticipate that these pressures will lessen throughout the year and as additional new products are introduced, our marketing message continues to resonate and our in-store experience becomes even stronger, we expect reported sales growth to strengthen and earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year. 
That wraps up my brief remarks. So I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

As far as what happens in any given quarter on gross margin, I don't think that's overly helpful to unpack. There's always mix effects, there is any number of things that can fall within that. And of course, our sales growth in the fourth quarter was lower than balance of the year, and so there's going to less fixed cost leverage even through the COGS line. As far as SG&A is concerned, I think one of the things that we've talked about a lot in the past is the need to ensure that our cost takeout programs are robust and strong and that takes a little bit of time to gear up, so to the extent that SG&A growth in the fourth quarter was lower than you might've seen throughout the year, I think that's a positive indicator. And as we think about the guidance we provided for 2019, we're basically saying that we're going to get operating margin expansion on low single digit sales growth.

As far the profitability, as you could imagine, the cost of running an e-com portal is less than that of running a brick-and-mortar operation, and if you look at the products that we tend to sell on e-com, they tend to be lower priced items, more silver items that have higher margins associated with them, you're not going to sell a lot of high jewelry pieces off your website. So I think it's fair to say that e-com is more profitable than brick-and-mortar, but again, we don't necessarily look at it that way, we're running a business and we want to serve our customers however they choose to shop, which kind of gets to your question on inventory as well. What we're driving towards is a seamless inventory model whereby we can get the product to our customers in any market at any time, any way that they would choose to receive it.

Obviously, when we introduce new products, we typically try and engineer and price those in a way that they're accretive to margin as well.

The first one is on domestic U.S. consumers. There is a clear divide in the year between first half and second half and PAPER FLOWERS were launched in mid-2018, and you have been through a lot of marketing, branding, in-store experience, remodeling. So I was wondering what your incremental, let's say, comments could be in terms of how to drive growth irrespective of favorable top-down trends given that so much had been done with impact in the second half rather than the first half. And the second question is a follow-up on SG&A. The fact that leverage seems to be so much better and the combination of efficiencies and gross margin seem to be affecting some of what we thought were going to be higher investment needs, is this leaving you in a comfortable position when the luxury framework is becoming very competitive in using deep pockets to fuel the visibility of the competing brands? And within the SG&A, if the expected increase coming from the New York store remodeling is also including some assumptions on potential sales disruptions that you may be facing?"

Now I don't have to say this to any specific product because we saw it affecting all different product categories and price points. So that I really see it more linked to something bigger and more to do with the consumer confidence of the U.S. in [ third ] quarter. Don't forget that the stock price, the stock market did very poorly, exactly in the -- in November and December, and there were several factors that for sure affected our kind of consumers that of course are related also with the macroeconomic environment."

We try not to distinguish, again, a whole lot between gross margin expansion and SG&A margin expansion. At the end of the day, it's all about operating margin expansion. In this past year, we clearly stated that we expect operating margin to be down and it was for the year that we just provided guidance for, we expect it to be up modestly, and then our long-term algorithms still would suggest that we would expect to see about a 50 basis point improvement in margin thereafter and that's still what we're working against. As far as your question on the flagship store, this past year we had about $0.07 of dilution related to that, we said for next year, it would be somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15. It's not driven by an expectation of sales disruption, it really comes down to a number of things, it's the incremental rent for the temporary space, it's the accelerated depreciation associated with the project itself because now that we're transforming elements of the existing store, we need to depreciate and accelerate the depreciation over now and when the project will go live. And then there are certain expense dollars related to some consultants and others that really can't be capitalized. Those are the 3 elements principally that come into play as it relates to that. But we don't expect a sales disruption in that map."

One is, what we call the foundational systems, that's what we're standing up a common order management system, a common financial tube. It's letting us bring on Coupa, which is an indirect procurement module. It also is going to give us one common inventory management system. We stood that up this past year in China and 7 other Asia Pacific countries. As I intimated earlier, that's one of the reasons that we can now support a Chinese Tiffany enabled website because we now have the ability to provide that product to the customers through those new portals. We're going to continue to stand up additional geographies as we go forward as it relates to that endeavor. It will continue to take a number of years though between now and when we get the entire world stood up on that system. Second thing we always talked about was our digital replatforming, and if you get a chance to look at our new website, which we just stood up this week, I think you'll see a dramatic step forward in the capabilities of the site. We've, obviously, done very well in the past with our e-commerce portals. We've won a lot of awards, though a lot of that frankly was through sheer just force of will and just the dedication of the teams here, but they didn't have the proper tools to really allow them to do a lot of the things that we'll now be able to do from a clienteling, from an outreach standpoint, from an AB testing standpoint. And so we're now well on our way on our digital replatforming, and once we get the China e-com site up later this year that'll be another big step forward. And then we're looking at a lot of the work that we need to do in order to put together the data hub so we can do a lot of predictive work and get a lot of analytical packages in place. We've also been working on advance planning systems for our production teams, and obviously, we've also working on a lot of the CAD/CAM elements related to the JDIW, which is our Jewelry Design and Innovation Workshop.

Now of course out of TIFFANY TRUE, we expect an improvement -- I mean, an improvement in our sales in engagement rings, but consider that what we did in the U.S. has been a prelaunch, very limited, I'll just give you an example in terms of carat stone, it was limited to the 1 carat, 1.5 carat stone that is pretty expensive part of the assortment and also the jewelry that goes with it, and this really part of the concept will be just launched from now going onwards in the year. So I think it's still early to assess, also because, especially, for diamond rings and engagement rings, the decision process of the customer is very long. Typically, it takes several months and several interactions with that brand on the website in the stores, et cetera, before making a decision. So it's not really an impulse kind of purchase, but we are very confident there."

For example, the sterling silver is not a strong category with Chinese customers because there is not a big tradition there, it's more an Anglo-Saxon tradition. So all these brings the average purchase of the Chinese customer higher, much higher than the equivalent American or European one. Now about the difference between the purchase of Chinese in Mainland China versus when they are traveling around the world is not really material. It depends more on the destination, in the sense that there are destinations that are more for mid-customers that come from second-, third-tier cities with a smaller budget, there are destinations that are more for -- more affluent customers.

Mark Erceg and I will address these results in a broad sense and as they pertain to our key-strategic priorities. And then we will allow plenty of time for your questions. 
The specific details of our financial results can be found in today's news release and 10-K filing. 
Broadly speaking, I'm pleased with Tiffany's annual results in 2018 and with what our global team accomplished. For the full year, sales rose in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe and increased in most product categories, and we were encouraged to experience higher sales attributed to local customers in the full year, even though sales attributed to foreign tourists were volatile. 
As you know, our sales growth decelerated in the second half. We can talk about external factors that benefited us in the first half and then went against us in the second half. But I believe it is more productive to focus on the journey that we started exactly 1 year ago, when we presented to you our 6 strategic priorities as well as our decision to increase investment spending in several areas to support sustainable long-term growth. And we made substantial progress in the past year and a lot is going to happen in 2019. 
Our strategy to amplify and evolve the brand message was highlighted with bolder messaging in the BELIEVE IN LOVE, ""Believe in Dreams"" and holiday campaigns. These campaigns came as a pleasant surprise to our audience and signaled that something new and exciting was starting to happen at Tiffany. 
I am pleased that as a result, sales growth in 2018 came from our existing customer base as well as from new customers and former customers who have not shopped at Tiffany in a number of years. 
Then since January 2019, we have strengthened our message on diamonds. A #ATiffanyDiamondADay campaign on social media. Our leading innovation of providing to customers the country or region of origin of our individually registered diamonds and the enormous visibility of the legendary 128 carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond with Lady Gaga at the Oscars are a synchronized assertion of the beauty, traceability and glamor of our superlative Tiffany diamonds. 
Another strategy is to renew our product offerings, at a faster pace, and in 2018 we unveiled the PAPER FLOWERS jewelry line, introduced numerous extensions of existing collections, made a significant investment in high jewelry inventory to build a more powerful assortment in some of our key locations around the world. And we began to offer expansive jewelry customizations through the Make It My Tiffany program.
For holiday 2018, we launched in the U.S. a limited assortment of the TIFFANY TRUE collection. We are now excited to rollout the launch of the TIFFANY TRUE solitaire and the boldly designed jewelry in all the regions and with increasing new styles throughout 2019. 
For our priority to deliver an exciting customer experience, in 2018 we expanded Tiffany's store presence with the opening of 10 stores in high potential markets around the world, while relocating a number of existing stores and closing 4 stores for a net increase of 6 stores. 
And of course, we announced the bold initiative to transform our New York flagship store into an exciting 21st century retail experience by the end of 2021. 
In 2019, we will have some important openings in key cities. We just completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, a significant market for Tiffany. It's a beautiful store in Sydney at the corner of Pitt and King Street that has surprised customers, press and the entire industry for its stylish esthetics, imposing size and refined experience. And next week, we will celebrate the grand opening of our newest location in the U.S., the first -- our first store in Washington, D.C. In CityCenterDc, a new luxury destination for local customers and tourists. 
We plan to announce other important new stores in key markets, such as in Greater China, during the course of the year. In addition to opening new stores, we are also evolving our presentations within existing stores through our fresh and innovative global display announcement initiatives in North America, which we are now pleased to extend in 2019 to the rest of the world. 
In terms of delivering a more exciting omnichannel experience, we are now upgrading our websites globally, which provides a number of benefits to both the consumer experience and Tiffany's ability to innovate. We are offering a rich, blended experience of content and commerce, elevating the brand, while reducing the friction in the user's journey as much as possible. The enhancements give Tiffany more agility in testing, personalizing and content optimization. 
For example, on our U.S. website, we have just begun offering for sale select love and engagement diamond rings online. U.S. clients can now filter available inventory for purchase on tiffany.com in addition to consulting a diamond expert to find the perfect ring. 
In recent years, Tiffany has been accepting phone orders for diamond rings from customers who live beyond our store distribution, so we believe this is a natural and complementary expansion of our in-store experience for the love and engagement category. And we look forward to a process of continuous improvement in our digital capabilities going forward, including plans to introduce a company-operated, e-commerce-enabled website in China later this year. 
In summary, we are still in the early stages of the long and exciting journey that I referred to 1 year ago. The Tiffany brand is increasingly recognized and desired, our talented organization is aligned with our strategic priorities and is getting more proactive and agile every day. 
I believe that the long-term outlook is very promising. I will now turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve when just a little over 1 year ago, we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities, fiscal 2018",747,"Thanks, Alex. From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve when just a little over 1 year ago, we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities, fiscal 2018 would be an investment year. 
Since Alex has already commented on our sales performance, let me say just a few words about earnings from operations, diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. 
You will recall us stating that fiscal 2018 operating earnings were expected to be flat to slightly down in order to fund meaningful investments across a number of areas we felt were essential to support sustainable, long-term, mid-single-digit sales growth. Consistent with that, earnings from operations came in at $790 million versus $809 million during fiscal 2017, a decline of approximately 2%. 
We also passed along significant benefits associated with U.S. tax reform. Specifically, we started the year expecting an overall 2018 effective tax rate somewhere in the high 20s and as more information became available and we completed our analysis, we ultimately ended the year just a fraction over 21%. 
While our 2018 effective tax rate did include some onetime benefits not directly associated with the lower U.S. statutory tax rate, a lower effective tax rate was the primary driver that allowed us to finish the year with diluted net EPS at $4.75 per share, which was towards the higher end of the last guidance range we provided of $4.65 to $4.80 per share, and well above our initial fiscal 2018 guidance of being somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per share. 
Finally, we started the year projecting approximately $380 million of free cash flow and after revising our projections to account for higher inventory levels, including for high jewelry and increased cash payments from income taxes related to U.S. tax reform, we ended the year at $250 million of free cash flow. 
So in total, and across our key financial performance indicators of sales growth, operating earnings, net earnings and free cash flow, I think it is fair to say we delivered what we set out to achieve. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the year with $855 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus roughly $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This means that after spending more than $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and after increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 10%, which was the 17th increase in the past 16 years, our balance sheet remains a major source of strength and flexibility. 
In terms of our outlook for 2019, we are maintaining the preliminary guidance we provided on January 18 when we reported holiday sales results. Low single-digit sales growth for the full year as reported and slightly higher on a constant exchange-rate basis and a mid-single-digit increase in diluted EPS. 
It's worth noting that our forecast for mid-single EPS growth and our expectation of modest operating margin expansion includes a number of unique factors. First, incremental SG&A expense related to the New York flagship store project, which was $0.07 per share in 2018 is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Second, our 2019 forecast accounts for the fact that we will no longer be able to recognize an $8 million a year deferred gain on previous sale leasebacks, due to a new accounting standard. Finally, we expect an all-in effective income tax rate of approximately 23% in 2019, which is roughly 200 basis points higher than fiscal 2018. 
From a timing standpoint and consistent with January results, while we expect full year reported sales to grow by a low single-digit percentage, we expect sales in the first half to be adversely affected by several factors. A meaningful FX headwind, lower foreign tourist spending and a difficult comparison to strong base period comps. In addition to these items, first half earnings will also be negatively affected by incremental strategic investment spending that began in the second quarter of 2018 and has not yet fully annualized. 
We anticipate that these pressures will lessen throughout the year and as additional new products are introduced, our marketing message continues to resonate and our in-store experience becomes even stronger, we expect reported sales growth to strengthen and earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year. 
That wraps up my brief remarks. So I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

As far as what happens in any given quarter on gross margin, I don't think that's overly helpful to unpack. There's always mix effects, there is any number of things that can fall within that. And of course, our sales growth in the fourth quarter was lower than balance of the year, and so there's going to be less fixed cost leverage even through the COGS line. As far as SG&A is concerned, I think one of the things that we've talked about a lot in the past is the need to ensure that our cost takeout programs are robust and strong and that takes a little bit of time to gear up, so to the extent that SG&A growth in the fourth quarter was lower than you might have seen throughout the year, I think that's a positive indicator. And as we think about the guidance we provided for 2019, we're basically saying that we're going to get operating margin expansion on low single-digit sales growth. So I think, again, our cost takeout programs continue to ramp up, and I think you're seeing some of that in the fourth quarter at this point."

Well, about the messaging, it was a big change in 2018, and we are pleased to see that sales, both to existing customers as well as new customers, are increasing. And so we are happy with it and we have seen also in the last quarter, even if it was softer, a nice result in terms of sales to existing customers, which is reassuring that the new message is not putting away customers from our brand, but on the contrary, bringing them back. Now in terms of disappointment, well, of course, the last quarter, I think it was a mix of external factors, we have seen it also in general in the industry, especially in our luxury, that the last quarter has not been as fantastic as the first part of the year, so Tiffany was affected by this. But on the other side, there were surely internal factors because we are really at the first year of our transformative journey, and we are working very hard on it, but we are far from having all the pieces of the puzzle put together. So we are working on it, going ahead, but we were not perfect. We have done a lot, a lot of new things. Also things where we have made some mistakes and we are learning and we are addressing it. So I will say it's a mix of external but also reasonably expected internal factors."

Our e-com business this past year grew at roughly twice the rate of our overall business, and we would expect that trend to continue at least for the next several years. As far the profitability, as you could imagine, the cost of running an e-com portal is less than that of running a brick-and-mortar operation, and if you look at the products that we tend to sell on e-com, they tend to be lower priced items, more silver items that have higher margins associated with them, you're not going to sell a whole lot of high jewelry pieces off your website. So I think it's fair to say that e-com is more profitable than brick-and-mortar, but again, we don't necessarily look at it that way, we're running a business and we want to serve our customers however they choose to shop, which kind of gets to your question on inventory as well.

Obviously, when we introduce new products, we typically try and engineer and price those in a way that they're accretive to margin as well.

And so towards the end of the year, we are working in order to have a critical month for the holiday. When you start seeing the work on the network, like I referred that this year we have several important stores that are opening, that of course are the result of the last 1.5 year of negotiation of renovations, et cetera. And this is why I mentioned in my remarks, Sydney, Washington, D.C. and there is [ important ] more to come. And the -- I think it is important also to remark the work that we have started doing, since the beginning, on efficiency that it didn't show for several quarters because as you know efficiencies take a lot to be achieved, but you started seeing a sign of that in the fourth quarter and this is something we committed to. So a lot of things going on. Honestly, how much we achieved, well, I think we are probably at the -- we are for sure at the beginning of our plan. Then probably in the first third of our plan. And there is a crescendo, there is a critical month that will be reached going forward. So we are very excited for all the things we are doing. We are confident and we are fighting for it."

And the second question is a follow-up on SG&A. The fact that leverage seems to be so much better and the combination of efficiencies and gross margin seem to be affecting some of what we thought were going to be higher investment needs, is this leaving you in a comfortable position when the luxury framework is becoming very competitive in using deep pockets to fuel the visibility of the competing brands?

We try not to distinguish, again, a whole lot between gross margin expansion and SG&A margin expansion. At the end of the day, it's all about operating margin expansion. In this past year, we clearly stated that we expect operating margin to be down and it was for the year that we just provided guidance for, we expect it to be up modestly., And then our long-term algorithms still would suggest that we would expect to see about a 50 basis point improvement in margin thereafter and that's still what we're working against. As far as your question on the flagship store, this past year we had about $0.07 of dilution related to that, we said for next year, it would be somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15. It's not driven by an expectation of sales disruption, it really comes down to a number of things, it's the incremental rent for the temporary space, it's the accelerated depreciation associated with the project itself because now that we're transforming elements of the existing store, we need to depreciate and accelerate the depreciation over now and when the project will go live. And then there are certain expense dollars related to some consultants and others that really can't be capitalized. Those are the 3 elements principally that come into play as it relates to that.

One is, what we call the foundational systems, that's where we're standing up a common order management system, a common financial tube.

We stood that up this past year in China and 7 other Asia Pacific countries. As I intimated earlier, that's one of the reasons that we can now support a Chinese Tiffany-enabled website because we now have the ability to provide that product to the customers through those new portals. We're going to continue to stand up additional geographies as we go forward as it relates to that endeavor. It will continue to take a number of years though between now and when we get the entire world stood up on that system. Second thing we always talked about was our digital replatforming, and if you get a chance to go take a look at our new website, which we just stood up this week, I think you'll see a dramatic step forward in the capabilities of the site. We've, obviously, done very well in the past with our e-commerce portals. We've won a lot of awards, though a lot of that frankly was through sheer just force of will and just the dedication of the teams here, but they didn't have the proper tools to really allow them to do a lot of the things that we'll now be able to do from a clientele and from an outreach standpoint, from an AB testing standpoint. And so we're now well on our way on our digital replatforming, and once we get the China e-com site up later this year that'll be another big step forward. And then we're looking at a lot of the work that we need to do in order to put together the data hub so we can do a lot of predictive work and get a lot of analytical packages in place. We've also been working on advance planning systems for our production teams, and obviously, we've been also working on a lot of the CAD/CAM elements related to the JDIW, which is our Jewelry Design and Innovation Workshop.

So I think it's still early to assess, also because, especially for diamond rings and engagement rings, the decision process of the customer is very long. Typically, it takes several months and several interactions with that brand on the website in the stores, et cetera, before making a decision.

So that's really what you're seeing and of course, we do that at a competitive cost, we benchmark all of our internal productions versus external purchases, and we're confident that we're actually margin accretive through bringing that effectively in-house and we end up with a better product as well."

Two things that I think are fair for me to point out specifically though, one relates to FX, so if you sit here today and you take spot, what you would see is that we're going to have 3-point headwind in the first quarter versus the prior period, by the second quarter that becomes roughly a 1-point headwind based on spot right now, by the third quarter it's a push and by the time you get to the fourth quarter it's maybe a 50 basis point help.

They are big lovers of gold and platinum, especially, with diamonds, engagement rings is very strong with them. For example, the sterling silver is not a strong category with Chinese customers because there is not a big tradition there, it's more an Anglo-Saxon tradition. So all this brings the average purchase of the Chinese customer higher, much higher than the equivalent American or European one. Now about the difference between the purchase of Chinese in Mainland China versus when they are traveling around the world is not really material. It depends more on the destination, in the sense that there are destinations that are more for customers that come from second-, third-tier cities with a smaller budget, there are destinations that are more -- for more affluent customers. So it has more to do with that than really the nature of the customer because at the end of the day, the customer is the same when he's at home or abroad."

The specific details of our financial results can be found in today's news release and 10-K filing. 
Broadly speaking, I'm pleased with Tiffany's annual results in 2018 and with what our global team accomplished. For the full year, sales rose in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe and increased in most product categories, and we were encouraged to experience higher sales attributed to local customers in the full year, even though sales attributed to foreign tourists were volatile. 
As you know, our sales growth decelerated in the second half. We can talk about external factors that benefited us in the first half and then went against us in the second half. But I believe it is more productive to focus on the journey that we started exactly 1 year ago when we presented to you our 6 strategic priorities as well as our decision to increase investment spending in several areas to support sustainable long-term growth. And we made substantial progress in the past year and a lot is going to happen in 2019. 
Our strategy to amplify and evolve the brand message was highlighted with bolder messaging in the BELIEVE IN LOVE, ""Believe in Dreams"" and holiday campaigns. These campaigns came as a pleasant surprise to our audience and signaled that something new and exciting was starting to happen at Tiffany. 
I am pleased that as a result, sales growth in 2018 came from our existing customer base as well as from new customers and former customers who have not shopped at Tiffany in a number of years. 
Then since January 2019, we have strengthened our message on diamonds. A #ATiffanyDiamondADay campaign on social media. Our leading innovation of providing to customers the country or region of origin of our individually registered diamonds and the enormous visibility of the legendary 128 carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond with Lady Gaga at the Oscars are a synchronized assertion of the beauty, traceability and glamor of our superlative Tiffany diamonds. 
Another strategy is to renew our product offerings, at a faster pace, and in 2018 we unveiled the PAPER FLOWERS jewelry line, introduced numerous extensions of existing collections, made a significant investment in high jewelry inventory to build a more powerful assortment in some of our key locations around the world. And we began to offer expansive jewelry customizations through the Make It My Tiffany program.
For holiday 2018, we launched in the U.S. a limited assortment of the TIFFANY TRUE collection. We are now excited to roll out the launch of the TIFFANY TRUE solitaire and the boldly designed jewelry in all the regions and with increasing new styles throughout 2019. 
For our priority to deliver an exciting customer experience, in 2018 we expanded Tiffany's store presence with the opening of 10 stores in high potential markets around the world while relocating a number of existing stores and closing 4 stores for a net increase of 6 stores. 
And of course, we announced the bold initiative to transform our New York flagship store into an exciting 21st century retail experience by the end of 2021. 
In 2019, we will have some important openings in key cities. We just completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, a significant market for Tiffany. It's a beautiful store in Sydney at the corner of Pitt and King Street that has surprised customers, press and the entire industry for its stylish esthetics, imposing size and refined experience. And next week, we will celebrate the grand opening of our newest location in the U.S., the first -- our first store in Washington, D.C. In CityCenterDc, a new luxury destination for local customers and tourists. 
We plan to announce other important new stores in key markets, such as in Greater China, during the course of the year. In addition to opening new stores, we are also evolving our presentations within existing stores through our fresh and innovative global display announcement initiatives in North America, which we are now pleased to extend in 2019 to the rest of the world. 
In terms of delivering a more exciting omnichannel experience, we are now upgrading our websites globally, which provides a number of benefits to both the consumer experience and Tiffany's ability to innovate. We are offering a rich, blended experience of content and commerce, elevating the brand, while reducing the friction in the user's journey as much as possible. The enhancements give Tiffany more agility in testing, personalizing and content optimization. 
For example, on our U.S. website, we have just begun offering for sale select love and engagement diamond rings online. U.S. clients can now filter available inventory for purchase on tiffany.com in addition to consulting a diamond expert to find the perfect ring. 
In recent years, Tiffany has been accepting phone orders for diamond rings from customers who live beyond our store distribution, so we believe this is a natural and complementary expansion of our in-store experience for the love and engagement category. And we look forward to a process of continuous improvement in our digital capabilities going forward, including plans to introduce a company-operated, e-commerce-enabled website in China later this year. 
In summary, we are still in the early stages of the long and exciting journey that I referred to 1 year ago. The Tiffany brand is increasingly recognized and desired, our talented organization is aligned with our strategic priorities and is getting more proactive and agile every day. 
I believe that the long-term outlook is very promising. I will now turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve when just a little over 1 year ago, we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities, fiscal 2018",748,"Thanks, Alex. From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve when just a little over 1 year ago, we shared our 6 strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities, fiscal 2018 would be an investment year. 
Since Alex has already commented on our sales performance, let me say just a few words about earnings from operations, diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. 
You will recall us stating that fiscal 2018 operating earnings were expected to be flat to slightly down in order to fund meaningful investments across a number of areas we felt were essential to support sustainable, long-term, mid-single-digit sales growth. Consistent with that, earnings from operations came in at $790 million versus $809 million during fiscal 2017, a decline of approximately 2%. 
We also passed along significant benefits associated with U.S. tax reform. Specifically, we started the year expecting an overall 2018 effective tax rate somewhere in the high 20s and as more information became available and we completed our analysis, we ultimately ended the year just a fraction over 21%. 
While our 2018 effective tax rate did include some onetime benefits not directly associated with the lower U.S. statutory tax rate, a lower effective tax rate was the primary driver that allowed us to finish the year with diluted net EPS at $4.75 per share, which was towards the higher end of the last guidance range we provided of $4.65 to $4.80 per share, and well above our initial fiscal 2018 guidance of being somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per share. 
Finally, we started the year projecting approximately $380 million of free cash flow and after revising our projections to account for higher inventory levels, including for high jewelry and increased cash payments from income taxes related to U.S. tax reform, we ended the year at $250 million of free cash flow. 
So in total, and across our key financial performance indicators of sales growth, operating earnings, net earnings and free cash flow, I think it is fair to say we delivered what we set out to achieve. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the year with $855 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus roughly $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This means that after spending more than $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and after increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 10%, which was the 17th increase in the past 16 years, our balance sheet remains a major source of strength and flexibility. 
In terms of our outlook for 2019, we are maintaining the preliminary guidance we provided on January 18 when we reported holiday sales results. Low single-digit sales growth for the full year as reported and slightly higher on a constant exchange rate basis and a mid-single-digit increase in diluted EPS. 
It's worth noting that our forecast for mid-single EPS growth and our expectation of modest operating margin expansion includes a number of unique factors. First, incremental SG&A expense related to the New York flagship store project, which was $0.07 per share in 2018 is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Second, our 2019 forecast accounts for the fact that we will no longer be able to recognize an $8 million a year deferred gain on previous sale leasebacks due to a new accounting standard. Finally, we expect an all-in effective income tax rate of approximately 23% in 2019, which is roughly 200 basis points higher than fiscal 2018. 
From a timing standpoint and consistent with January results, while we expect full year reported sales to grow by a low single-digit percentage, we expect sales in the first half to be adversely affected by several factors. A meaningful FX headwind, lower foreign tourist spending and a difficult comparison to strong base period comps. In addition to these items, first half earnings will also be negatively affected by incremental strategic investment spending that began in the second quarter of 2018 and has not yet fully annualized. 
We anticipate that these pressures will lessen throughout the year and as additional new products are introduced, our marketing message continues to resonate and our in-store experience becomes even stronger, we expect reported sales growth to strengthen and earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year. 
That wraps up my brief remarks. So I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

And of course, our sales growth in the fourth quarter was lower than balance of the year, and so there's going to be less fixed cost leverage even through the COGS line. As far as SG&A is concerned, I think one of the things that we've talked about a lot in the past is the need to ensure that our cost takeout programs are robust and strong and that takes a little bit of time to gear up, so to the extent that SG&A growth in the fourth quarter was lower than you might have seen throughout the year, I think that's a positive indicator. And as we think about the guidance we provided for 2019, we're basically saying that we're going to get operating margin expansion on low single-digit sales growth.

Now in terms of disappointment, well, of course, the last quarter, I think it was a mix of external factors, we have seen it also in general in the industry, especially in our luxury, that the last quarter has not been as fantastic as the first part of the year, so Tiffany was affected by this. But on the other side, there were surely internal factors because we are really at the first year of our transformative journey, and we are working very hard on it, but we are far from having all the pieces of the puzzle put together. So we are working on it, going ahead, but we were not perfect. We have done a lot, a lot of new things. Also things where we have made some mistakes and we are learning and we are addressing it.

Our e-com business this past year grew at roughly twice the rate of our overall business, and we would expect that trend to continue at least for the next several years. As for the profitability, as you could imagine, the cost of running an e-com portal is less than that of running a brick-and-mortar operation, and if you look at the products that we tend to sell on e-com, they tend to be lower priced items, more silver items that have higher margins associated with them, you're not going to sell a whole lot of high jewelry pieces off your website. So I think it's fair to say that e-com is more profitable than brick-and-mortar, but again, we don't necessarily look at it that way, we're running a business and we want to serve our customers however they choose to shop, which kind of gets to your question on inventory as well. What we're driving towards is a seamless inventory model whereby we can get the product to our customers in any market, at any time, any way that they would choose to receive it. And we just talked about the new digital platform that we've put up across our e-com sites, but Alex also alluded to the fact that we're going to be standing up in our China e-com website later this year, which we're very excited about and we've talked in the past about the need to put in the right structure inventory management systems, order management systems, distribution systems, in order to enable that and clearly, that's what we've been doing."

Obviously, when we introduce new products, we typically try and engineer and price those in a way that they're accretive to margin as well. We've talked about in the past, us having pricing power, we continue to believe we have pricing power and we plan to be taking modest pricing in the current fiscal year.

The first one is on domestic U.S. consumers. There is a clear divide in the year between first half and second half and PAPER FLOWERS were launched in mid-2018, and you have been through a lot of marketing, branding, in-store experience, remodeling. So I was wondering what your incremental, let's say, comments could be in terms of how to drive growth irrespective of favorable top-down trends given that so much had been done with impact in the second half rather than the first half. And the second question is a follow-up on SG&A. The fact that leverage seems to be so much better and the combination of efficiencies and gross margin seem to be affecting some of what we thought were going to be higher investment needs, is this leaving you in a comfortable position when the luxury framework is becoming very competitive in using deep pockets to fuel the visibility of the competing brands? And within the SG&A, if the expected increase coming from the New York store remodeling is also including some assumptions on potential sales disruptions that you may be facing?"

Now, I don't associate this to any specific product because we saw it affecting all different product categories and price points. So that I really see it more linked to something bigger and more to do with the consumer confidence of the U.S. in [ this ] quarter. Don't forget that the stock price, the stock market, did very poorly, exactly in the -- in November and December, and there were several factors that for sure affected our kind of consumers that of course, are related also with the macroeconomic environment."

We try not to distinguish, again, a whole lot between gross margin expansion and SG&A margin expansion. At the end of the day, it's all about operating margin expansion. In this past year, we clearly stated that we expect operating margin to be down and it was for the year that we just provided guidance for, we expect it to be up modestly., And then our long-term algorithms still would suggest that we would expect to see about a 50 basis point improvement in margin thereafter and that's still what we're working against. As far as your question on the flagship store, this past year we had about $0.07 of dilution related to that, we said for next year, it would be somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15. It's not driven by an expectation of sales disruption, it really comes down to a number of things, it's the incremental rent for the temporary space, it's the accelerated depreciation associated with the project itself because now that we're transforming elements of the existing store, we need to depreciate and accelerate the depreciation over now and when the project will go live. And then there are certain expense dollars related to some consultants and others that really can't be capitalized. Those are the 3 elements principally that come into play as it relates to that.

One is, what we call the foundational systems, that's where we're standing up a common order management system, a common financial tube. It's letting us bring on Coupa, which is an indirect procurement module. It also is going to give us one common inventory management system. We stood that up this past year in China and 7 other Asia Pacific countries. As I intimated earlier, that's one of the reasons that we can now support a Chinese Tiffany-enabled website because we now have the ability to provide that product to the customers through those new portals. We're going to continue to stand up additional geographies as we go forward as it relates to that endeavor. It will continue to take a number of years though between now and when we get the entire world stood up on that system. Second thing we always talked about was our digital replatforming, and if you get a chance to go take a look at our new website, which we just stood up this week, I think you'll see a dramatic step forward in the capabilities of the site. We've, obviously, done very well in the past with our e-commerce portals. We've won a lot of awards, though a lot of that frankly was through sheer just force of will and just the dedication of the teams here, but they didn't have the proper tools to really allow them to do a lot of the things that we'll now be able to do from a clientele and from an outreach standpoint, from an AB testing standpoint. And so we're now well on our way on our digital replatforming, and once we get the China e-com site up later this year that'll be another big step forward. And then we're looking at a lot of the work that we need to do in order to put together the data hub so we can do a lot of predictive work and get a lot of analytical packages in place. We've also been working on advance planning systems for our production teams, and obviously, we've been also working on a lot of the CAD/CAM elements related to the JDIW, which is our Jewelry Design and Innovation Workshop. So there's a lot of big elements associated with our transformation of our IT systems that will continue."

Now of course, out of TIFFANY TRUE, we expect an improvement in our sales in engagement rings, but consider that what we did in the U.S. has been a prelaunch, very limited, I'll just give you an example, in terms of carat stone, it was limited to the 1 carat, 1.5 carat stone that is a pretty expensive part of the assortment and also the jewelry that goes with it, and this really part of the concept will be just launched from now going onwards in the year. So I think it's still early to assess, also because, especially for diamond rings and engagement rings, the decision process of the customer is very long. Typically, it takes several months and several interactions with that brand on the website in the stores, et cetera, before making a decision. So it's not really an impulse kind of purchase, but we are very confident with it.."

For example, the sterling silver is not a strong category with Chinese customers because there is not a big tradition there, it's more an Anglo-Saxon tradition. So all this brings the average purchase of the Chinese customer higher, much higher than the equivalent American or European one. Now about the difference between the purchase of Chinese in Mainland China versus when they are traveling around the world is not really material. It depends more on the destination, in the sense that there are destinations that are more for customers that come from second-, third-tier cities with a smaller budget, there are destinations that are more -- for more affluent customers. So it has more to do with that than really the nature of the customer because at the end of the day, the customer is the same when he's at home or abroad."

35576,607251084,1752080,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth, and I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you this update. I will",1175,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth, and I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you this update. 
I will first state the obvious. Tiffany's results in recent quarters had not been up to the long-term growth standards we have set for ourselves. Regional results in the first quarter were slightly softer than what we expected. Worldwide sales declined 3% following a strong 15% increase in last year's first quarter. However, worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis were equal to the prior year with sales growth in Asia Pacific and Europe on the same basis offset by a decline in the Americas and then changed the results in Japan. 
We believe that external pressures had a significant impact on sales. For example, we believe that the strong dollar had a meaningful impact on first quarter retail sales attributing to foreign tourists in the Americas. Our internal estimates indicate that those tourist sales represents a lower double-digit percentage of our American retail sales. Those sales were down approximately 25% from 1 year ago with sharper declines among Chinese tourists which in fact were even more pronounced than declines in the second half of last year. However, our internal estimates also indicate that constant currency retail sales to local customers, which we believe are much more -- much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, were up by approximately 3% from a global basis during the first quarter with strong growth in mainland China being particularly noteworthy. This is why he we remain focused on the strategic priorities which are within our control and that identify and are aggressively pursuing numerous ways we can enhance the excitement and relevance of this amazing brand. We strongly believe that effectively executing our strategic priorities, first and foremost, will be what takes this company to new heights of success. 
Let me give you a few examples. Our strategy to renew our product offerings continues to gain momentum. After successfully launching the platinum and diamond-based PAPER FLOWERS collection last year, we are continuing to add new design to this collection. Another major collection we recently introduced is the TIFFANY TRUE collection featuring an innovative modern engagement ring design with a new diamond cut in a gold or platinum as well as with a combining. 
Finally, on a smaller scale, we have recently introduced to further Love Bugs that complements our Return to Tiffany collection. Importantly, we have also included a gold version of Return to Tiffany Love Bugs in addition to silver, which is consistent with our strategy to continue driving higher than average transaction value across all of our categories. And I can tell you that we have a substantial amount of newness planned for the second half of the year with additions to the Tiffany T and HardWear collections among others. And I'm also pleased that we now have even greater visibility into our product innovation pipeline for the next several years, and I'm excited about what is being developed. 
We are also steadily progressing with our strategic [indiscernible] and evolving message focused on our most iconic collections and especially Tiffany T. The current campaign showcases beautiful Tiffany jewels worn by a cast of some of the most recognizable and richly diverse fashion models in the world. The brand's unique joyful attitude and iconic blue color made the campaign unexpectedly Tiffany. Importantly, the campaign is truly a digital first campaign with most of the investment and assets directly -- directed towards social and other digital media. 
I should also highlight the publicity we have received and substantially that were made in social media after Lady Gaga appeared at the Academy Awards in late February wearing the legendary 128 carat Tiffany diamond, and we are making substantial progress to enhance our in-store presentations. We launched our global display enhancement initiative last year to have fresh and innovative elements of visual merchandising for those in North America, and we are now on track to complete the rollout of that initiative to all stores globally by this fall. 
We have also added some new stores in the first quarter. We opened our first store in Washington d.C. in the new CityCenterDc luxury complex. We also completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, where we opened the magnificent new store at the corner of Pitt and King streets in Sydney. 
We are continuing our exciting development in mainland China this year, and total sales continued to grow by double-digit rate in local currency in the first quarter. Our recent initiatives included relocating our store in Beijing's China world to an exceptional location with redesigned 6,000 square-foot format, showcasing an innovative and distinctive retail experience that encourages international fashion. 
Also, we opened a concept store in Japan on Tokyo's Cat street located in Harajuku. That experiential design for Tiffany at Cat Street showcases the wit, creativity and of the brand. From jewelry to home and accessories, the store offers a thematically curated selection and presentation of iconic designs and [indiscernible] houses, take effect at the top floor. 
In terms of our projects to transform the New York lectured store into 21st century experience, construction has begun on the adjusted space with an anticipated completion of the temporary space by year-end. Once completed, we will shift most of our retailing space to that adjacent location for 2020 and 2021. Complementing the store base, we relaunched all of our global websites in the first quarter which, going forward, will allow us to offer a blended experience of content and commerce with demands that we expect will enable us to more effectively test, personalize and optimize content and ultimately ensure a better customer experience in the long term. In addition, for the first time, customers in the U.S. can now order online from a select assortment of band and engagement rings. 
While we are understandably excited about these new capabilities, we did make the conscious decision to suspend digital marketing for a portion of the first quarter to ensure that our newly revamped website could handle the load balances associated with the complete digital replatforming, and we believe that decision, while prudent, negatively impacted first quarter sales, although e-commerce sales still grew faster than total company sales. 
It is probably also worth a second to mention that we are getting closer to introducing an e-commerce-enabled website in China which we believe will further strengthen our business in this important market. 
So in closing, we are pursuing a substantial number of initiatives to benefit our customers and drive sales and earnings growth as we move forward on this long journey. We certainly do not believe that first quarter results are indicative of our longer-term earnings power, and recent external pressures will not sway us from the growth opportunities available to us. And now Mark Erceg has a few comments before we open up the call to all the questions."
35576,607251084,1752080,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign to",840,"Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign tourist spending and meaningful FX headwind follows by stronger second half results as year-over-year comparisons get easier, foreign exchange pressures lessened and the bulk of our 2019 new product launches and associated marketing support reaches the market. 
Since we expected first quarter sales to be under pressure and we knew that the incremental strategic investment spending which began during the second quarter 2018 needed to be fully annualized, we correctly anticipated downward earnings pressure in the first quarter, which is consistent with the results we just released. Gross margin was below last year, which reflected negative sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales as well as shifts in sales mix, including an increase in higher-priced jewelry that earns a lower gross margin and an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that earn as little as gross margin partially offset by lower product-related costs. 
SG&A expense growth was restrained in the quarter through tight expense management including cost savings from our global procurement program, labor cost reductions through organizational efficiencies and of course variable cost savings tied directly to sales. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due primarily to an increase in estimated 2018 foreign derived intangible income benefit we realized as a result of recently issued U.S. Treasury guidance. That said, we continue to believe that our all-in effective tax rate for the full year will be in the low 20s. 
Net inventories as of April 30 were 6% above the prior year as we continue to work off higher-than-expected postholiday levels, but importantly, we continue to expect minimal year-over-year growth by year-end. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, having finished the quarter with $763 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with just over $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This enables us to reinvest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders. For example, we are spending more on capital expenditures for the next couple of years to support the transformation of our New York flagship store while we also continue to invest in the modernization of our IT infrastructure. At the same time that we're investing in the future of our business we are returning cash to shareholders apps evidenced by $25 million we spent during the quarter to repurchase approximately 270,000 shares of common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which is consistent with our stated objective to move over time our dividend payout ratio closer to 50%. This will be the 18th dividend increase in the past 17 years. 
Operationally, we are pleased with the progress being made with our IT system upgrades. Since our last earnings release, we have upgraded our e-commerce digital platforms and activated a new advanced supply chain planning system which had enabled more sophisticated load management and production scheduling across our suppliers and our vertically integrated manufacturing network. 
So all in all, we just reported an admittedly soft but mostly anticipated and overall productive start to 2019, during which a number of strategic initiatives continued to advance. From a guidance standpoint and relative to the top line, we are being impacted by further declines in foreign tourist spending where we continue to look for low single-digit sales growth for the year. Relative to the bottom line, we implemented some modest pricing actions toward the end of the first quarter and have plans for cost management throughout the balance of the year, but we are being affected by the softness in foreign tourist spending and, to a lesser extent, the recent imposition of higher tariff rates on jewelry product that we export from the U.S. into China and our decision to not meaningfully increase our retail prices in China at the present time. Since we are determined to properly support and protect our business in mainland China against our principal competitors, we do not have to contend with higher import costs into China based on their unique sourcing locations. And after taking everything else we've discussed today into account, we think it's prudent to modestly widen our earnings per share guidance range from mid-single-digit growth to low to mid-single-digit growth. And of course, as we mentioned on our last call, we should not lose sight of the fact that EPS growth in 2019 is expected to be affected by incremental expenses tied to New York flagship store renovations which we estimate at $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2019 versus $0.07 per share last year as well as a change in accounting standards that no longer allows us to recognize approximately $8 million per year of deferred gains on previous sale-leasebacks. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Mark."

And this is in line -- it's not even a little bit stronger trend than we have seen in the past couple of quarters. Now this is -- of course, has a negative impact on the comp sales in the U.S. because double-digit percentage of sales depends on tourists, and so of course, this affects the overall. And as I said, the local -- the domestic customers were positive, but with -- I would say, quite cautious.

Now realistically and practically, we are hoping that once we get the third quarter, the rate of reduction that we've seen in Chinese tourism, we're hoping that, that moderates because, frankly, it was such a swift decline and it will be kind of hard to believe that year-over-year, we could see a continuing step-down of that magnitude.

We get the rough boxes. Sometimes we get to reprocess those and push them back out with Tiffany quality. We also saw some negative sales leverage on fixed costs. I would expect that to continue for another quarter or so, but certainly by the second half of the year when we're ramping back up for our second half product launches and things, we expect our factory loads to be much more balanced. So that should be kind of a temporary phenomenon. And then as far as the mix is concerned, we talked about was the fact that we sold a lot of additional higher price point items in the first quarter and that's really at the end of the day probably a good thing for us. So as we think about the full year on a margin basis, we knew the first half would be tough. We expect to make a ground in the second half, and so when the dust settles out in the full year based on the guidance we've given, we expect operating margin to be flat to maybe slightly up as we sit here today."

And in terms of plans for the second part of the year, we will keep on pursuing the strategy that we have started last year and that, first and foremost, the process which is the most important we have because what we have been doing has been to launch starting from PAPER FLOWERS in platinum, then TIFFANY TRUE in platinum and gold and the jewelry in gold. We will continue with this approach of introducing newness, mainly in gold, at a very accelerated pace. And so far, even if it is only 1 year, we are seeing that in our results, the growth in revenues comes from the newness and especially, from the newness in gold, and the higher the price, the higher the performance. So this, we find it very reassuring for the strategy we have taken and also reinforcing the brand and clearing if anybody had a doubt that Tiffany is a luxury brand -- clearing definitely this out because we are seeing increasing average transaction value and strong performance in the gold and more precious categories. We believe this is positive for the brand in the short term and the long term and the launches that we have foreseen for the second part of the year continue in the same strategy."

From this point forward, I would say the run rate you're going to see as far as investment spending, marketing support, [indiscernible] I think it will be fairly steady and constant from Q2 throughout the year. And then perhaps once elevated and stepped up, the amount of spending we think is appropriate in order to sustainably grow the business. So I think at this point, most of that is now behind us which is important. As far as the cost takeout efforts are concerned, however, I think I would tell you that we felt [indiscernible] with respect to that.

We're standing up as we speak which will give them visibility into all of our [indiscernible] which is something we haven't had at this point in time.

It's going to allow us to make better buy decisions. It will enable much more of specific capacity planning. I mean frankly, we've been managing our production levels on Excel spreadsheets for this point in time across our factory network. So we will be scheduling across our facilities and vendors, details of the production scheduling for each manufacturer, those types of things are big enablers for us.

So for me, that is strategically very important. The 2% negative in Engagement Jewelry actually it's a little bit -- it's a flattish kind of situation. We have to also remember that we are comparing it to last year when we grew at constant exchange rate, it's 11%. At engagement, it's plus 11% that was astonishing last year.

And as soon as we will get closer to the date, I will be pleased to share which are these lines. But let me say, I feel very confident about the work we are doing. It's -- I can imagine that some of you, there is a sense of frustration because you hear me being positive about these introductions, and on the other side, you see sales that are constant or basically flat. Now the reason is and that [indiscernible] tourism and we believe there is a factor that to modify, to evolve the assortment of a brand like Tiffany, it takes time. And we have to keep on going and adding newness. We are seeing that newness is paying back but of course the customer in front of the newness -- prefers the newness and [indiscernible] existing products. So we will see -- we have to reach the critical amount of units in order to give to the customer an option in our stores that is wider than it is now. And we are working very fast about this but there are limits that are not just -- not really about the manufacturing but is also the marketing and the time that is required in order to introduce [indiscernible] in the market without creating a [indiscernible] consciousness in the customers.

35576,607251084,1752204,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. I w",1179,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. 
I will first state the obvious. Tiffany's results in recent quarters have not been up to the long-term growth standards we have set for ourselves. Regional results in the first quarter were slightly softer than what we expected. Worldwide sales declined 3% following a strong 15% increase in last year's first quarter. However, worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis were equal to the prior year with sales growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe on the same basis, offset by a decline in the Americas and then changed the results in Japan.  
We believe that external pressures had a significant impact on sales. For example, we believe that the strong dollar had a meaningful impact on first quarter retail sales attributed to foreign tourists in the Americas. Our internal estimates indicate that those tourist sales represents a low double-digit percentage of our American retail sales. Those sales were down approximately 25% from a year ago with sharper declines among Chinese tourists, which in fact were even more pronounced than declines in the second half of last year. 
However, our internal estimates also indicate that constant currency retail sales to local customers, which we believe are much more -- much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, were up by approximately 3% from a global basis during the first quarter with strong growth in mainland China being particularly noteworthy. This is why we remain focused on the strategic priorities which are within our control and then identified and are aggressively pursuing numerous ways we can enhance the excitement and relevance of this amazing brand. We strongly believe that effectively executing our strategic priorities, first and foremost, will be what takes this company to new heights of success. 
Let me give you a few examples. Our strategy to renew our product offerings continues to gain momentum. After successfully launching the platinum- and diamond-based PAPER FLOWERS collection last year, we are continuing to add new designs to this collection. Another major collection we recently introduced is the TIFFANY TRUE collection, featuring an innovative modern engagement ring design with a new diamond cut in a gold or platinum setting as well as with accompanying band rings. 
Finally, on a smaller scale, we have recently introduced Tiffany Love Bugs that complements our Return to Tiffany collection. Importantly, we have also included a gold version of Return to Tiffany Love Bugs in addition to silver, which is consistent with our strategy to continue driving higher-than-average transaction value across all of our product categories. And I can tell you that we have a substantial amount of newness planned for the second half of the year with additions to the Tiffany T and HardWear collections among others. And I'm also pleased that we now have even greater visibility into our product innovation pipeline for the next several years. And I'm excited about what is being developed. 
We are also steadily progressing with our strategy to amply and evolve brand message. Focused on our most iconic collections and especially Tiffany T., the current campaign showcases beautiful Tiffany jewels worn by a cast of some of the most recognizable and richly diverse fashion models in the world. The brand's unique joyful attitude and iconic blue color made the campaign unexpectedly Tiffany. Importantly, the campaign is truly a digital-first campaign with most of the investment and assets directly -- directed towards social and other digital media.  
I should also highlight the publicity we have received and substantial impressions that were made in social media after Lady Gaga appeared at the Academy Awards in late February wearing the legendary 128-carat Tiffany Diamond. And we are making substantial progress to enhance our in-store presentations. We launched our global display enhancement initiative last year to add fresh and innovative elements of visual merchandising for our stores in North America. And we are now on track to complete the rollout of that initiative to all stores globally by this fall. 
We have also added some new stores in the first quarter. We opened our first store in Washington, D.C. in the new CityCenterDC luxury complex. We also completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, where we opened a magnificent new store at the corner of Pitt and King Streets in Sydney. We are continuing our exciting development in mainland China this year. And total sales continued to grow by a double-digit rate in local currency in the first quarter. Our recent initiatives included relocating our store in Beijing's China World to an exceptional location with a redesigned 6,000-square foot format, showcasing an innovative and distinctive retail experience that encourages interaction and self-expression. 
Also we opened a concept store in Japan on Tokyo's Cat Street. Located in Harajuku, the experiential design for Tiffany at Cat Street showcases the wit, creativity and timelessness of the brand. From jewelry to home and accessories, the store offers a thematically curated selection and presentation of iconic designs and even houses a café at the top floor. In terms of our projects to transform the New York flagship store into 21st century experience, construction has begun on the adjacent space with an anticipated completion of that temporary space by year-end. Once completed, we will shift most of our retailing space to that adjacent location for 2020 and 2021. 
Complementing the store base, we relaunched all of our global websites in the first quarter which, going forward, will allow us to offer a blended experience of content and commerce with enhancements that we expect will enable us to more effectively test, personalize and optimize content and ultimately ensure a better customer experience in the long term. In addition, for the first time, customers in the U.S. can now order online from a select assortment of band engagement rings. 
While we are understandably excited about these new capabilities, we did make the conscious decision to suspend digital marketing for a portion of the first quarter to ensure that our newly revamped websites could handle the load balances associated with a complete digital replatforming. And we believe that decision, while prudent, negatively impacted first quarter sales, although e-commerce sales still grew faster than total company sales. It is probably also worth a second to mention that we are getting closer to introducing an e-commerce-enabled website in China, which we believe will further strengthen our business in this important market. 
So in closing, we are pursuing a substantial number of initiatives to benefit our customers and drive sales and earnings growth as we move forward on this long journey. We certainly do not believe that first quarter results are indicative of our longer-term earnings power and recent external pressures will not sway us from the growth opportunities available to us. 
And now Mark Erceg has a few comments before we open up the call to all the questions."
35576,607251084,1752204,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign to",849,"Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign tourist spending and meaningful FX headwind followed by stronger second half results as year-over-year comparisons get easier, foreign exchange pressures lessen and the bulk of our 2019 new product launches and associated marketing support reaches the market. 
Since we expected first quarter sales to be under pressure, and we knew that the incremental strategic investment spending, which began during the second quarter of 2018, needed to be fully annualized, we correctly anticipated downward earnings pressure in the first quarter, which is consistent with the results we just released. Gross margin was below last year, which reflected negative sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales as well as shifts in sales mix, including an increase in higher price point jewelry that earns a lower gross margin and an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that earn as little if any gross margin, partially offset by lower product-related costs. 
SG&A expense growth was restrained in the quarter through tight expense management, including cost savings from our global procurement program, labor cost reductions through organizational efficiencies and, of course, variable cost savings tied directly to sales. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due primarily to an increase in estimated 2018 Foreign Derived Intangible Income benefit we realized as a result of recently issued U.S. Treasury guidance. That said, we continue to believe that our all-in effective tax rate for the full year will be in the low 20s. 
Net inventories as of April 30 were 6% above the prior year as we continue to work off higher-than-expected postholiday levels. But importantly, we continue to expect minimal year-over-year growth by year-end. Our balance sheet remains strong, having finished the quarter with $763 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with just over $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This enables us to reinvest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders. For example, we are spending more on capital expenditures for the next couple of years to support the transformation of our New York flagship store while we also continue to invest in the modernization of our IT infrastructure. 
At the same time that we're investing in the future of our business, we are returning cash to shareholders as evidenced by $25 million we spent during the quarter to repurchase approximately 270,000 shares of common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which is consistent with our stated objective to move over time our dividend payout ratio closer to 50%. This will be the 18th dividend increase in the past 17 years. 
Operationally, we are pleased with the progress being made with our IT system upgrades. Since our last earnings release, we have upgraded our e-commerce digital platforms and activated a new advanced supply chain planning system, which should enable more sophisticated load management and production scheduling across our suppliers and our vertically integrated manufacturing network. 
So all in all, we just reported an admittedly soft but mostly anticipated and overall productive start to 2019, during which a number of strategic initiatives continued to advance. From a guidance standpoint and relative to the top line, we are being impacted by further declines in foreign tourist spending, where we continue to look for low single-digit sales growth for the year. Relative to the bottom line, we implemented some modest pricing actions towards the end of the first quarter and have plans for strict cost control management throughout the balance of the year. But we are being affected by the softness in foreign tourist spending and, to a lesser extent, the recent imposition of higher tariff rates on jewelry products that we export from the U.S. into China and our decision to not meaningfully increase our retail prices in China at the present time. 
Since we are determined to properly support and protect our business in mainland China against our principal competitors, we do not have to contend with higher import costs into China based on their unique sourcing locations. And after taking everything else we have discussed today into account, we think it is prudent to modestly widen our earnings per share guidance range from mid-single-digit growth to low to mid-single-digit growth. And of course, as we mentioned on our last call, we should not lose sight of the fact that EPS growth in 2019 is expected to be affected by incremental expenses tied to the New York flagship store renovations, which we estimate at $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2019 versus $0.07 per share last year as well as a change in accounting standards that no longer allows us to recognize approximately $8 million per year of deferred gains on previous sale-leasebacks. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Mark."

And we have recorded a very strong increase in brand power in China for the Tiffany brand. So I'm feeling very confident about the step we have taken in the last 12 months in terms of new communication because at least in these 2 key markets, we're showing that it has strengthened the brand and gives, I think, answer to your question about both existing customers and new customers, we are seeing progress in both of them."

That is easier for holiday, not only the ground floor but the entire flagship -- current flagship building will be open. And now let's go to the other questions that are more articulated. So first of all, it's about the tourists in the U.S. The tourists in the U.S. represent a low double-digit percentage of our total sales in the U.S. And we have you seen a sharper decrease to sales to tourists in the U.S. in the range of 25%, even sharper for Chinese tourists. And this is in line -- it's not even a little bit stronger trend than we have seen in the past couple of quarters. Now this is -- of course, it has a negative impact on the comp sales in the U.S. because double-digit percentage of sales depends on tourists. And so of course, this affects the overall. And as I said, the local -- the domestic customers were positive but with, I would say, quite cautious. What is important for me is that the relevance of the brand with Chinese customers that keeps on being confirmed by the strong performance in China."

I'd tell you, the tourism one is hard for us to be overly predictive of. But we are trend-takers, so to speak. Just like we take spot FX and presume that what holds through balance of the year, we're kind of doing the same thing here with the tourism. We're not assuming things get any better, but we're also not necessarily assuming things get any worse, just that the trends that we had seen continue on. Now realistically and practically, we are hoping that once we get to the third quarter, the rate of reduction that we've seen in Chinese tourism, we're hoping that, that moderates because frankly with such a swift decline, it would be kind of hard to believe that year-over-year, we could see a continuing step-down of that magnitude. But at this point, we're not being overly optimistic. We don't have our second half plans predicated upon tourism suddenly coming back to us, which is something we can't control. 
As for the gross margin, when you think about what happened in the first quarter, there was really three factors. One was the wholesale sale of diamonds, which we really can't be overly predictive of. We get the rough boxes in, sometimes we get to reprocess those and push them back out though not Tiffany quality. We also saw some negative sales leverage on fixed costs. I would expect that to continue for another quarter or so. But certainly by the second half of the year when we're ramping back up for our second half product launches and things, we expect our factory loads to be much more balanced. So that should be kind of a temporary phenomenon. And then as far as the mix is concerned, we talked about was the fact that we sold a lot of additional higher price point items in the first quarter. And that's really at the end of the day probably a good thing for us. So as we think about the full year on a margin basis, we knew the first half would be tough. We expect to make up ground in the second half. And so when the dust settles out on the full year based on the guidance we've given, we would expect operating margin to be flat to maybe slightly up as we sit here today."

And so far, even if it is only 1 year, we are seeing that in our results, the growth in revenues comes from the newness and especially from the newness in gold. And the higher the price, the higher the performance. 
So this, we find it very reassuring for the strategy we have taken and also reinforcing the brand and clearing, if anybody has a doubt that Tiffany is a luxury brand, clearing definitely this out because we are seeing increasing average transaction value and strong performance in the gold and more precious categories.

And Alex commented in our prepared remarks about [indiscernible] digital marketing elements as we stood up our 13 global e-commerce-enabled sites. So that arguably was a little bit of a push. From this point forward, I would say the run rate you're going to see as far as investment spending, marketing support, in-store [indiscernible], I think it will be fairly steady and constant from Q2 through the balance of the year. And then from that point, we already elevated and stepped up the amount of spending we think is appropriate in order to sustainably grow the business. So I think at this point, most of that is now behind us, which is important. As far as the cost takeout efforts are concerned, however, I think I would tell you that we felt [indiscernible] with respect to that. 
The global procurement group has been around for a number of years. They continue to do really good work. We're standing up a source-to-pay system as we speak, which will give them visibility into all of our global spend pools, which is something they haven't had up to this point in time. We're doing a lot of work with our suppliers and our supplier enablement and putting supplier scorecards in place, doing a lot more diligent tracking as it relates to that. The jewelry design and innovation workshop we talked about before has been a great intervention, where we bring the [indiscernible] and the design group and the engineering group together to let us do [indiscernible] costing, [indiscernible], allows us to do [indiscernible] modeling. I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the advanced planning system we just stood up on the manufacturing side of the house. This was a multimillion-dollar project that spanned well over a year and took a lot of multifunctional participation. But it's going to allow us to optimize our inventory levels. It's going to allow us to make better make-versus-buy decisions. It will enable much more sophisticated capacity planning. I mean frankly, we've been managing our production loads on Excel spreadsheets up to this point in time across our factory network. So to be able to do mass rescheduling across our facilities and vendors, detail the production scheduling for each manufacturer, those types of things are big enablers for us. So I could go on. But I think that should give you some sense of the things that we're working against."

Of course, the 4% is made of this strong growth and also negative on silver, less expensive items and, of course, products that were older in our assortment. But I'm -- while the 4% may seem just a low single digit, actually for me strategically, it's very important that is the average of some very strong growth in the lines in which we have invested for, for the future. So for me, that is strategically very important. 
The 2% negative in Engagement Jewelry, actually it's a little bit -- it's a flattish kind of situation. We have to also remember that we are comparing to last year when we grew at constant exchange rate 11% and engagement plus 11%, that was astonishing last year. So I see it as performance.

It is the engagement on social media. This is why I -- in my prepared remarks, I underscored how the initiative, for example, of the red carpet, Lady Gaga and also the new advertising campaign, where we are using very well-known models, like Carolyn Murphy, Mica Argañaraz, Kendall Jenner, et cetera.

If you look past the current year and you try and get past all these temporal effects that are affecting the business, we still are confident and believe that we should be able to -- through our cost management efforts and through growing the top line in a more consistent fashion, extract margin gains of roughly 50 basis points per annum, and that would over time obviously move us to a much better place.

We will focus for the second part of this year on existing iconic lines, like Tiffany T, like other, where we have a very good response by customers and where we believe there is the opportunity to injecting some newness that can be very, very effective.

And on the other side, you see sales that at constant rates are basically flat.

And we have to keep on going and adding newness. We are seeing that newness is paying back. But of course, the customer in front of the newness prefers the newness and leaves aside the existing products. So we will see -- we have to reach the critical mass in newness in order to give to the customer an option in our stores that is wider than it is now. And we are working very fast about this.

There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. I w",1179,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. 
I will first state the obvious. Tiffany's results in recent quarters have not been up to the long-term growth standards we have set for ourselves. Regional results in the first quarter were slightly softer than what we expected. Worldwide sales declined 3% following a strong 15% increase in last year's first quarter. However, worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis were equal to the prior year with sales growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe on the same basis, offset by a decline in the Americas and then changed the results in Japan.  
We believe that external pressures had a significant impact on sales. For example, we believe that the strong dollar had a meaningful impact on first quarter retail sales attributed to foreign tourists in the Americas. Our internal estimates indicate that those tourist sales represent a low double-digit percentage of our American retail sales. Those sales were down approximately 25% from a year ago with sharper declines among Chinese tourists, which in fact were even more pronounced than declines in the second half of last year. 
However, our internal estimates also indicate that constant currency retail sales to local customers, which we believe are much more -- much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, were up by approximately 3% from a global basis during the first quarter with strong growth in mainland China being particularly noteworthy. This is why we remain focused on the strategic priorities which are within our control and then identified and are aggressively pursuing numerous ways we can enhance the excitement and relevance of this amazing brand. We strongly believe that effectively executing our strategic priorities, first and foremost, will be what takes this company to new heights of success. 
Let me give you a few examples. Our strategy to renew our product offerings continues to gain momentum. After successfully launching the platinum- and diamond-based PAPER FLOWERS collection last year, we are continuing to add new designs to this collection. Another major collection we recently introduced is the TIFFANY TRUE collection, featuring an innovative modern engagement ring design with a new diamond cut in a gold or platinum setting as well as with accompanying band rings. 
Finally, on a smaller scale, we have recently introduced Tiffany Love Bugs that complements our Return to Tiffany collection. Importantly, we have also included a gold version of Return to Tiffany Love Bugs in addition to silver, which is consistent with our strategy to continue driving higher-than-average transaction value across all of our product categories. And I can tell you that we have a substantial amount of newness planned for the second half of the year with additions to the Tiffany T and HardWear collections among others. And I'm also pleased that we now have even greater visibility into our product innovation pipeline for the next several years. And I'm excited about what is being developed. 
We are also steadily progressing with our strategy to amplify and evolve brand message. Focused on our most iconic collections and especially Tiffany T, the current campaign showcases beautiful Tiffany jewels worn by a cast of some of the most recognizable and richly diverse fashion models in the world. The brand's unique joyful attitude and iconic blue color made the campaign unexpectedly Tiffany. Importantly, the campaign is truly a digital-first campaign with most of the investment and assets directly -- directed towards social and other digital media.  
I should also highlight the publicity we have received and substantial impressions that were made in social media after Lady Gaga appeared at the Academy Awards in late February wearing the legendary 128-carat Tiffany Diamond. And we are making substantial progress to enhance our in-store presentations. We launched our global display enhancement initiative last year to add fresh and innovative elements of visual merchandising to our stores in North America. And we are now on track to complete the rollout of that initiative to all stores globally by this fall. 
We have also added some new stores in the first quarter. We opened our first store in Washington, D.C. in the new CityCenterDC luxury complex. We also completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, when we opened a magnificent new store at the corner of Pitt and King Streets in Sydney. We are continuing our exciting development in mainland China this year. And total sales continued to grow by a double-digit rate in local currency in the first quarter. Our recent initiatives included relocating our store in Beijing's China World to an exceptional location with a redesigned 6,000-square foot format, showcasing an innovative and distinctive retail experience that encourages interaction and self-expression. 
Also we opened a concept store in Japan on Tokyo's Cat Street. Located in Harajuku, the experiential design for Tiffany at Cat Street showcases the wit, creativity and timelessness of the brand. From jewelry to home and accessories, the store offers a thematically curated selection and presentation of iconic designs and even houses a café at the top floor. In terms of our projects to transform the New York flagship store into 21st century experience, construction has begun on the adjacent space with an anticipated completion of that temporary space by year-end. Once completed, we will shift most of our retailing space to that adjacent location for 2020 and 2021. 
Complementing the store base, we relaunched all of our global websites in the first quarter which, going forward, will allow us to offer a blended experience of content and commerce with enhancements that we expect will enable us to more effectively test, personalize and optimize content and ultimately ensure a better customer experience in the long term. In addition, for the first time, customers in the U.S. can now order online from a select assortment of band engagement rings. 
While we are understandably excited about these new capabilities, we did make the conscious decision to suspend digital marketing for a portion of the first quarter to ensure that our newly revamped websites could handle the load balances associated with a complete digital replatforming. And we believe that decision, while prudent, negatively impacted first quarter sales, although e-commerce sales still grew faster than total company sales. It is probably also worth a second to mention that we are getting closer to introducing an e-commerce-enabled website in China, which we believe will further strengthen our business in this important market. 
So in closing, we are pursuing a substantial number of initiatives to benefit our customers and drive sales and earnings growth as we move forward on this long journey. We certainly do not believe that first quarter results are indicative of our longer-term earnings power and recent external pressures will not sway us from the growth opportunities available to us. 
And now Mark Erceg has a few comments before we open up the call to all the questions."
35576,607251084,1755243,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign to",850,"Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign tourist spending and meaningful FX headwinds followed by stronger second half results as year-over-year comparisons get easier, foreign exchange pressures lessen and the bulk of our 2019 new product launches and associated marketing support reaches the market. 
Since we expected first quarter sales to be under pressure, and we knew that the incremental strategic investment spending, which began during the second quarter of 2018, needed to be fully annualized, we correctly anticipated downward earnings pressure in the first quarter, which is consistent with the results we just released. Gross margin was below last year, which reflected negative sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales as well as shifts in sales mix, including an increase in higher price point jewelry that earns a lower gross margin and an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that earn as little if any gross margin, partially offset by lower product-related costs. 
SG&A expense growth was restrained in the quarter through tight expense management, including cost savings from our global procurement program, labor cost reductions through organizational efficiencies and, of course, variable cost savings tied directly to sales. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due primarily to an increase in estimated 2018 Foreign Derived Intangible Income benefit we realized as a result of recently issued U.S. Treasury guidance. That said, we continue to believe that our all-in effective tax rate for the full year will be in the low 20s. 
Net inventories as of April 30 were 6% above the prior year as we continue to work off higher-than-expected post holiday levels. But importantly, we continue to expect minimal year-over-year growth by year-end. Our balance sheet remains strong, having finished the quarter with $763 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with just over $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This enables us to reinvest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders. For example, we are spending more on capital expenditures for the next couple of years to support the transformation of our New York flagship store while we also continue to invest in the modernization of our IT infrastructure. 
At the same time that we're investing in the future of our business, we are returning cash to shareholders as evidenced by $25 million we spent during the quarter to repurchase approximately 270,000 shares of common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which is consistent with our stated objective to move over time our dividend payout ratio closer to 50%. This will be the 18th dividend increase in the past 17 years. 
Operationally, we are pleased with the progress being made with our IT system upgrades. Since our last earnings release, we have upgraded our e-commerce digital platforms and activated a new advanced supply chain planning system, which should enable more sophisticated load management and production scheduling across our suppliers and our vertically integrated manufacturing network. 
So all in all, we just reported an admittedly soft but mostly anticipated and overall productive start to 2019, during which a number of strategic initiatives continued to advance. From a guidance standpoint and relative to the top line, we are being impacted by further declines in foreign tourist spending, where we continue to look for low single-digit sales growth for the year. Relative to the bottom line, we implemented some modest pricing actions towards the end of the first quarter and have plans for strict cost control management throughout the balance of the year. But we are being affected by the softness in foreign tourist spending and, to a lesser extent, the recent imposition of higher tariff rates on jewelry products that we export from the U.S. into China and our decision to not meaningfully increase our retail prices in China at the present time. 
Since we are determined to properly support and protect our business in mainland China against our principal competitors, we do not have to contend with higher import costs into China based on their unique sourcing locations. And after taking everything else we have discussed today into account, we think it is prudent to modestly widen our earnings per share guidance range from mid-single-digit growth to low to mid-single-digit growth. And of course, as we mentioned on our last call, we should not lose sight of the fact that EPS growth in 2019 is expected to be affected by incremental expenses tied to the New York flagship store renovations, which we estimate at $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2019 versus $0.07 per share last year as well as a change in accounting standards that no longer allows us to recognize approximately $8 million per year of deferred gains on previous sale-leasebacks. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Mark."

And it's very relevant to share with you is that we have just completed the regular annual health -- brand health survey that we do in the key markets. And so we are now able to compare our brand, how it is perceived now compared to when it was -- when the last survey that was more than 1 year ago, so before the new marketing campaigns that we launched last year. 
And I'm pleased of the results because we have seen, for example, in the U.S., an increase in relevance for -- and distinctiveness of our brand among the consumers, especially sophisticated consumers. And we have recorded a very strong increase in brand power in China for the Tiffany brand. So I'm feeling very confident about the step we have taken in the last 12 months in terms of new communication because at least in these 2 key markets, we're showing that it has strengthened the brand and gives, I think, answer to your question about both existing customers and new customers, we are seeing progress in both of them."

That is easier for holiday, not only the ground floor but the entire flagship -- current flagship building will be open. And now let's go to the other questions that are more articulated. So first of all, it's about the tourists in the U.S. The tourists in the U.S. represent a low double-digit percentage of our total sales in the U.S. And we have you seen a sharper decrease to sales to tourists in the U.S. in the range of 25%, even sharper for Chinese tourists. And this is in line -- it's not even a little bit stronger trend than we have seen in the past couple of quarters. Now this is -- of course, it has a negative impact on the comp sales in the U.S. because double-digit percentage of sales depends on tourists. And so of course, this affects the overall. And as I said, the local -- the domestic customers were positive but with, I would say, quite cautious. What is important for me is that the relevance of the brand with Chinese customers that keeps on being confirmed by the strong performance in China."

I'd tell you, the tourism one is hard for us to be overly predictive of. But we are trend-takers, so to speak. Just like we take spot FX and presume that what holds through balance of the year, we're kind of doing the same thing here with the tourism. We're not assuming things get any better, but we're also not necessarily assuming things get any worse, just that the trends that we had seen continue on. Now realistically and practically, we are hoping that once we get to the third quarter, the rate of reduction that we've seen in Chinese tourism, we're hoping that, that moderates because frankly with such a swift decline, it would be kind of hard to believe that year-over-year, we could see a continuing step-down of that magnitude. But at this point, we're not being overly optimistic. We don't have our second half plans predicated upon tourism suddenly coming back to us, which is something we can't control. 
As for the gross margin, when you think about what happened in the first quarter, there was really three factors. One was the wholesale sale of diamonds, which we really can't be overly predictive of. We get the rough boxes in, sometimes we have to reprocess those and push them back out if it's not Tiffany quality. We also saw some negative sales leverage on fixed costs. I would expect that to continue for another quarter or so. But certainly by the second half of the year when we're ramping back up for our second half product launches and things, we expect our factory loads to be much more balanced. So that should be kind of a temporary phenomenon. And then as far as the mix is concerned, we talked about was the fact that we sold a lot of additional higher price point items in the first quarter. And that's really at the end of the day probably a good thing for us. So as we think about the full year on a margin basis, we knew the first half would be tough. We expect to make up ground in the second half. And so when the dust settles out on the full year based on the guidance we've given, we would expect operating margin to be flat to maybe slightly up as we sit here today."

And so far, even if it is only 1 year, we are seeing that in our results, the growth in revenues comes from the newness and especially from the newness in gold.

So this, we find it very reassuring for the strategy we have taken and also reinforcing the brand and clearing, if anybody has a doubt that Tiffany is a luxury brand, clearing definitely this out because we are seeing increasing average transaction value and strong performance in the gold and more precious categories.

So with respect to the first portion of what you asked, when you think about when we really started stepping up our investment spending profile, last year, it was principally in the second quarter. So we said that we needed to really lap and annualize that. We specifically asked were there any costs or charges or investments in the first quarter of this year that maybe slipped a little bit toward the second quarter or third quarter? And Alex commented in our prepared remarks about the decision to send some digital marketing elements as we stood up our 13 global e-commerce-enabled sites. So that arguably was a little bit of a push. From this point forward, I would say the run rate you're going to see as far as investment spending, marketing support, in-store [indiscernible], I think it will be fairly steady and constant from Q2 through the balance of the year. And then from that point, we already elevated and stepped up the amount of spending we think is appropriate in order to sustainably grow the business. So I think at this point, most of that is now behind us, which is important. As far as the cost takeout efforts are concerned, however, I think I would tell you that we felt [indiscernible] with respect to that. 
The global procurement group has been around for a number of years. They continue to do really good work. We're standing up a source-to-pay system as we speak, which will give them visibility into all of our global spend pools, which is something they haven't had up to this point in time. We're doing a lot of work with our suppliers and our supplier enablement and putting supplier scorecards in place, doing a lot more diligent tracking as it relates to that. The jewelry design and innovation workshop we talked about before has been a great intervention, where we bring the model makers and the designers and the engineering group together to let us do rapid costing, build rapid prototypes, allows us to do [indiscernible] modeling. I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the advanced planning system we just stood up on the manufacturing side of the house. This was a multimillion-dollar project that spanned well over a year and took a lot of multifunctional participation. But it's going to allow us to optimize our inventory levels. It's going to allow us to make better make-versus-buy decisions. It will enable much more sophisticated capacity planning. I mean frankly, we've been managing our production loads on Excel spreadsheets up to this point in time across our factory network. So being the master scheduling across all those facilities and vendors, detail the production scheduling for each manufacturer, those types of things are big enablers for us. So I could go on. But I think that should give you some sense of the things that we're working against."

But I wouldn't want to read much month-to-month. I think the quarter-to-quarter trends are probably more relevant."

So I will answer to your first question about the product categories. So in Jewelry Collections, we had a plus 1 -- reported plus 4% exchange rate exchange -- constant exchange rate basis performance. Now in Jewelry Collections, as I said before, we have seen a strong performance in our newest, most iconic and most precious lines. Of course, the 4% is made of this strong growth and also negative on silver, less expensive items and, of course, products that were older in our assortment. But I'm -- while the 4% may seem just a low single digit, actually for me strategically, it's very important that is the average of some very strong growth in the lines in which we have invested for, for the future. So for me, that is strategically very important. 
The 2% negative in Engagement Jewelry, actually it's a little bit -- it's a flattish kind of situation. We have to also remember that we are comparing to last year when we grew at constant exchange rate 11% and engagement plus 11%, that was astonishing last year. So I see it as performance. We have benefited of the launch of T True. But consider that T True engagement ring is now, for the time being, rolled out in the markets in the higher carats and not yet in smaller carats. So the reception by the market has been very positive. And the product is in line with our expectations, but it's not yet in its full potential."

The strongest one has been definitely the China -- mainland China customers. And I have to say that also in Europe, in spite of all the difficulties that, that continent has, we have seen a pretty positive performance there, totally driven by domestic customers. And because also Europe, in France notably but also other markets, had been negatively affected for that tourist component. Now in terms of engagement, I'm looking mostly at the other factors. It is the engagement on social media. This is why I -- in my prepared remarks, I underscored how the initiative, for example, of the red carpet, Lady Gaga and also the new advertising campaign, where we are using very well-known models, like Carolyn Murphy, Mica Argañaraz, Kendall Jenner, et cetera. 
What we are seeing is an enormous increase in engagement on social media for Tiffany by customers. Now this is far from being an assurance of increase of sales in the near future. But for sure, it's very reassuring when it comes to the connection and the relevance of the brand with local customers. So of course, as I said, I was expecting slightly better results than what we have achieved.

It's -- I can imagine that in some of you, there is a sense of frustration because you hear me being positive about these introductions. And on the other side, you see sales that at constant rates are basically flat. 
Now the reason is that, let aside the tourism and all this, there is a factor that to modify, to evolve the assortment of a brand like Tiffany, it takes time. And we have to keep on going and adding newness. We are seeing that newness is paying back. But of course, the customer in front of the newness prefers the newness and leaves aside the existing products. So we will see -- we have to reach the critical mass in newness in order to give to the customer an option in our stores that is wider than it is now. And we are working very fast towards this. But there are limits that are not just -- not really about the manufacturing but is also the marketing and the time that is required in order to introduce new lines in the market without creating a mass unconscious in the customer.

There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth.

There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. 
I will first state the obvious. Tiffany's results in recent quarters have not been up to the long-term growth standards we have set for ourselves. Regional results in the first quarter were slightly softer than what we expected. Worldwide sales declined 3% following a strong 15% increase in last year's first quarter. However, worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis were equal to the prior year with sales growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe on the same basis, offset by a decline in the Americas and then changed the results in Japan. 
We believe that external pressures had a significant impact on sales. For example, we believe that the strong dollar had a meaningful impact on first quarter retail sales attributed to foreign tourists in the Americas. Our internal estimates indicate that those tourist sales represent a low double-digit percentage of our American retail sales. Those sales were down approximately 25% from a year ago with sharper declines among Chinese tourists, which in fact were even more pronounced than declines in the second half of last year. 
However, our internal estimates also indicate that constant currency retail sales to local customers, which we believe are much more -- much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, were up by approximately 3% from a global basis during the first quarter with strong growth in mainland China being particularly noteworthy. This is why we remain focused on the strategic priorities which are within our control and then identified and are aggressively pursuing numerous ways we can enhance the excitement and relevance of this amazing brand. We strongly believe that effectively executing our strategic priorities, first and foremost, will be what takes this company to new heights of success. 
Let me give you a few examples. Our strategy to renew our product offerings continues to gain momentum. After successfully launching the platinum- and diamond-based PAPER FLOWERS collection last year, we are continuing to add new designs to this collection. Another major collection we recently introduced is the TIFFANY TRUE collection, featuring an innovative modern engagement ring design with a new diamond cut in a gold or platinum setting as well as with accompanying band rings. 
Finally, on a smaller scale, we have recently introduced Tiffany Love Bugs that complements our Return to Tiffany collection. Importantly, we have also included a gold version of Return to Tiffany Love Bugs in addition to silver, which is consistent with our strategy to continue driving higher-than-average transaction value across all of our product categories. And I can tell you that we have a substantial amount of newness planned for the second half of the year with additions to the Tiffany T and HardWear collections among others. And I'm also pleased that we now have even greater visibility into our product innovation pipeline for the next several years. And I'm excited about what is being developed. 
We are also steadily progressing with our strategy to amplify and evolve brand message. Focused on our most iconic collections and especially Tiffany T, the current campaign showcases beautiful Tiffany jewels worn by a cast of some of the most recognizable and richly diverse fashion models in the world. The brand's unique joyful attitude and iconic blue color made the campaign unexpectedly Tiffany. Importantly, the campaign is truly a digital-first campaign with most of the investment and assets directly -- directed towards social and other digital media. 
I should also highlight the publicity we have received and substantial impressions that were made in social media after Lady Gaga appeared at the Academy Awards in late February wearing the legendary 128-carat Tiffany Diamond. And we are making substantial progress to enhance our in-store presentations. We launched our global display enhancement initiative last year to add fresh and innovative elements of visual merchandising to our stores in North America. And we are now on track to complete the rollout of that initiative to all stores globally by this fall. 
We have also added some new stores in the first quarter. We opened our first store in Washington, D.C. in the new CityCenterDC luxury complex. We also completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, when we opened a magnificent new store at the corner of Pitt and King Streets in Sydney. We are continuing our exciting development in mainland China this year. And total sales continued to grow by a double-digit rate in local currency in the first quarter. Our recent initiatives included relocating our store in Beijing's China World to an exceptional location with a redesigned 6,000-square foot format, showcasing an innovative and distinctive retail experience that encourages interaction and self-expression. 
Also we opened a concept store in Japan on Tokyo's Cat Street. Located in Harajuku, the experiential design for Tiffany at Cat Street showcases the wit, creativity and timelessness of the brand. From jewelry to home and accessories, the store offers a thematically curated selection and presentation of iconic designs and even houses a café at the top floor. In terms of our projects to transform the New York flagship store into 21st century experience, construction has begun on the adjacent space with an anticipated completion of that temporary space by year-end. Once completed, we will shift most of our retailing space to that adjacent location for 2020 and 2021. 
Complementing the store base, we relaunched all of our global websites in the first quarter which, going forward, will allow us to offer a blended experience of content and commerce with enhancements that we expect will enable us to more effectively test, personalize and optimize content and ultimately ensure a better customer experience in the long term. In addition, for the first time, customers in the U.S. can now order online from a select assortment of band engagement rings. 
While we are understandably excited about these new capabilities, we did make the conscious decision to suspend digital marketing for a portion of the first quarter to ensure that our newly revamped websites could handle the load balances associated with a complete digital replatforming. And we believe that decision, while prudent, negatively impacted first quarter sales, although e-commerce sales still grew faster than total company sales. It is probably also worth a second to mention that we are getting closer to introducing an e-commerce-enabled website in China, which we believe will further strengthen our business in this important market. 
So in closing, we are pursuing a substantial number of initiatives to benefit our customers and drive sales and earnings growth as we move forward on this long journey. We certainly do not believe that first quarter results are indicative of our longer-term earnings power and recent external pressures will not sway us from the growth opportunities available to us. 
And now Mark Erceg has a few comments before we open up the call to all the questions."
35576,607251084,1756665,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign to",850,"Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign tourist spending and meaningful FX headwinds followed by stronger second half results as year-over-year comparisons get easier, foreign exchange pressures lessen and the bulk of our 2019 new product launches and associated marketing support reaches the market. 
Since we expected first quarter sales to be under pressure, and we knew that the incremental strategic investment spending, which began during the second quarter of 2018, needed to be fully annualized, we correctly anticipated downward earnings pressure in the first quarter, which is consistent with the results we just released. Gross margin was below last year, which reflected negative sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales as well as shifts in sales mix, including an increase in higher price point jewelry that earns a lower gross margin and an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that earn as little if any gross margin, partially offset by lower product-related costs. 
SG&A expense growth was restrained in the quarter through tight expense management, including cost savings from our global procurement program, labor cost reductions through organizational efficiencies and, of course, variable cost savings tied directly to sales. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due primarily to an increase in estimated 2018 Foreign Derived Intangible Income benefit we realized as a result of recently issued U.S. Treasury guidance. That said, we continue to believe that our all-in effective tax rate for the full year will be in the low 20s. 
Net inventories as of April 30 were 6% above the prior year as we continue to work off higher-than-expected post holiday levels. But importantly, we continue to expect minimal year-over-year growth by year-end. Our balance sheet remains strong, having finished the quarter with $763 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with just over $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This enables us to reinvest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders. For example, we are spending more on capital expenditures for the next couple of years to support the transformation of our New York flagship store while we also continue to invest in the modernization of our IT infrastructure. 
At the same time that we're investing in the future of our business, we are returning cash to shareholders as evidenced by $25 million we spent during the quarter to repurchase approximately 270,000 shares of common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which is consistent with our stated objective to move over time our dividend payout ratio closer to 50%. This will be the 18th dividend increase in the past 17 years. 
Operationally, we are pleased with the progress being made with our IT system upgrades. Since our last earnings release, we have upgraded our e-commerce digital platforms and activated a new advanced supply chain planning system, which should enable more sophisticated load management and production scheduling across our suppliers and our vertically integrated manufacturing network. 
So all in all, we just reported an admittedly soft but mostly anticipated and overall productive start to 2019, during which a number of strategic initiatives continued to advance. From a guidance standpoint and relative to the top line, we are being impacted by further declines in foreign tourist spending, where we continue to look for low single-digit sales growth for the year. Relative to the bottom line, we implemented some modest pricing actions towards the end of the first quarter and have plans for strict cost control management throughout the balance of the year. But we are being affected by the softness in foreign tourist spending and, to a lesser extent, the recent imposition of higher tariff rates on jewelry products that we export from the U.S. into China and our decision to not meaningfully increase our retail prices in China at the present time. 
Since we are determined to properly support and protect our business in mainland China against our principal competitors, we do not have to contend with higher import costs into China based on their unique sourcing locations. And after taking everything else we have discussed today into account, we think it is prudent to modestly widen our earnings per share guidance range from mid-single-digit growth to low to mid-single-digit growth. And of course, as we mentioned on our last call, we should not lose sight of the fact that EPS growth in 2019 is expected to be affected by incremental expenses tied to the New York flagship store renovations, which we estimate at $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2019 versus $0.07 per share last year as well as a change in accounting standards that no longer allows us to recognize approximately $8 million per year of deferred gains on previous sale-leasebacks. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Mark."

And so we are now able to compare our brand, how it is perceived now compared to when it was -- when the last survey that was more than 1 year ago, so before the new marketing campaigns that we launched last year. 
And I'm pleased of the results because we have seen, for example, in the U.S., an increase in relevance for -- and distinctiveness of our brand among the consumers, especially sophisticated consumers.

That is easier for holiday, not only the ground floor but the entire flagship -- current flagship building will be open. And now let's go to the other questions that are more articulated. So first of all, it's about the tourists in the U.S. The tourists in the U.S. represent a low double-digit percentage of our total sales in the U.S. And we have you seen a sharper decrease to sales to tourists in the U.S. in the range of 25%, even sharper for Chinese tourists. And this is in line -- it's not even a little bit stronger trend than we have seen in the past couple of quarters. 
Now this is -- of course, it has a negative impact on the comp sales in the U.S. because double-digit percentage of sales depends on tourists. And so of course, this affects the overall. And as I said, the local -- the domestic customers were positive but with, I would say, quite cautious.

I'd tell you, the tourism one is hard for us to be overly predictive of. But we are trend-takers, so to speak. Just like we take spot FX and presume that what holds through balance of the year, we're kind of doing the same thing here with the tourism. We're not assuming things get any better, but we're also not necessarily assuming things get any worse, just that the trends that we had seen continue on. Now realistically and practically, we are hoping that once we get to the third quarter, the rate of reduction that we've seen in Chinese tourism, we're hoping that, that moderates because frankly with such a swift decline, it would be kind of hard to believe that year-over-year, we could see a continuing step-down of that magnitude. But at this point, we're not being overly optimistic. We don't have our second half plans predicated upon tourism suddenly coming back to us, which is something we can't control. 
As for the gross margin, when you think about what happened in the first quarter, there was really three factors. One was the wholesale sale of diamonds, which we really can't be overly predictive of. We get the rough boxes in, sometimes we have to reprocess those and push them back out if it's not Tiffany quality. We also saw some negative sales leverage on fixed costs. I would expect that to continue for another quarter or so. But certainly by the second half of the year when we're ramping back up for our second half product launches and things, we expect our factory loads to be much more balanced. So that should be kind of a temporary phenomenon. And then as far as the mix is concerned, we talked about was the fact that we sold a lot of additional higher price point items in the first quarter. And that's really at the end of the day probably a good thing for us. So as we think about the full year on a margin basis, we knew the first half would be tough. We expect to make up ground in the second half. And so when the dust settles out on the full year based on the guidance we've given, we would expect operating margin to be flat to maybe slightly up as we sit here today."

And in terms of plans for the second part of the year, we will keep on pursuing the strategy that we have started last year. And they're, first and foremost, to products, which is the most important things we have. Because what we have been doing has been to launch, starting from PAPER FLOWERS in platinum, then Tiffany T True in platinum and gold and the jewelry in gold. We will continue with this approach of introducing newness, mainly in gold, at a very accelerated pace. And so far, even if it is only 1 year, we are seeing that in our results, the growth in revenues comes from the newness and especially from the newness in gold. And the higher the price, the higher the performance. 
So this, we find it very reassuring for the strategy we have taken and also reinforcing the brand and clearing, if anybody has a doubt that Tiffany is a luxury brand, clearing definitely this out because we are seeing increasing average transaction value and strong performance in the gold and more precious categories. We believe this is positive for the brand in the short term and the long term. And the launches that we are foreseeing for the second part of the year continue in the same strategy."

So was any of that SG&A had to be pushed out to the second half of this year perhaps to support the comp acceleration that you're looking forward around the innovation pipeline? And then I guess as we think about trying to connect that to next year, Mark, maybe you could just remind us what are the components that are allowing you to lever SG&A on a low single-digit comp this year.

So with respect to the first portion of what you asked, when you think about when we really started stepping up our investment spending profile, last year, it was principally in the second quarter. So we said that we needed to really lap and annualize that. We specifically asked were there any costs or charges or investments in the first quarter of this year that maybe slipped a little bit toward the second quarter or third quarter. And Alex commented in our prepared remarks about the decision to send some digital marketing elements as we stood up our 13 global e-commerce-enabled sites. So that arguably was a little bit of a push. 
From this point forward, I would say the run rate you're going to see as far as investment spending, marketing support, in-store [ dollars ], I think it will be fairly steady and constant from Q2 through the balance of the year. And then from that point, we already elevated and stepped up the amount of spending we think is appropriate in order to sustainably grow the business. So I think at this point, most of that is now behind us, which is important. 
As far as the cost takeout efforts are concerned, however, I think I would tell you that we felt [ positively ] with respect to that. The global procurement group has been around for a number of years. They continue to do really good work. We're standing up a source-to-pay system as we speak, which will give them visibility into all of our global spend pools, which is something they haven't had up to this point in time. We're doing a lot of work with our suppliers and our supplier enablement and putting supplier scorecards in place, doing a lot more diligent tracking as it relates to that. The jewelry design and innovation workshop we talked about before has been a great intervention, where we bring the model makers and the designers and the engineering group together to let us do rapid costing, build rapid prototypes, allows us to do [ ship costs ] modeling. 
I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the advanced planning system we just stood up on the manufacturing side of the house. This was a multimillion-dollar project that spanned well over a year and took a lot of multifunctional participation. But it's going to allow us to optimize our inventory levels. It's going to allow us to make better make-versus-buy decisions. It will enable much more sophisticated capacity planning. I mean frankly, we've been managing our production loads on Excel spreadsheets up to this point in time across our factory network. So being the master scheduling across all those facilities and vendors, detail the production scheduling for each manufacturer, those types of things are big enablers for us. So I could go on. But I think that should give you some sense of the things that we're working against."

That said, the reduction that we saw in the first quarter was even more extreme than what we experienced in the third quarter of the last year as well as the fourth quarter of last year. So the good news there, if there is any, is the fact we're trying to come up upon when we should at least start lapping that in the base period. 
As far as the other tourism is concerned, again I mentioned that, that's going to fall off in the fourth quarter. And that has continued as well. Within the quarter itself, I'm really hesitant to say anything about month-to-month because again this is internal data. This is some work that we do. From an estimation standpoint, there's not a third party to fully validate all of this. It's our internal sourcing. Which we believe is good, accurate.

Now in Jewelry Collections, as I said before, we have seen a strong performance in our newest, most iconic and most precious lines. Of course, the 4% is made of this strong growth and also negative on silver, less expensive items and, of course, products that were older in our assortment. But I'm -- while the 4% may seem just a low single digit, actually for me strategically, it's very important that is the average of some very strong growth in the lines in which we have invested for, for the future. So for me, that is strategically very important. 
The 2% negative in Engagement Jewelry, actually it's a little bit -- it's a flattish kind of situation. We have to also remember that we are comparing to last year when we grew at constant exchange rate 11% and engagement plus 11%, that was astonishing last year. So I see it as performance. We have benefited of the launch of T True. But consider that T True engagement ring is now, for the time being, rolled out in the markets in the higher carats and not yet in smaller carats. So the reception by the market has been very positive. And the product is in line with our expectations, but it's not yet in its full potential."

And because also Europe, in France notably but also other markets, had been negatively affected for that tourist component. Now in terms of engagement, I'm looking mostly at the other factors. It is the engagement on social media. This is why I -- in my prepared remarks, I underscored how the initiative, for example, of the red carpet, Lady Gaga and also the new advertising campaign, where we are using very well-known models, like Carolyn Murphy, Mica Argañaraz, Kendall Jenner, et cetera. 
What we are seeing is an enormous increase in engagement on social media for Tiffany by customers. Now this is far from being an assurance of increase of sales in the near future.

And we have to keep on going and adding newness. We are seeing that newness is paying back. But of course, the customer in front of the newness prefers the newness and leaves aside the existing products. So we will see -- we have to reach the critical mass in newness in order to give to the customer an option in our stores that is wider than it is now. And we are working very fast towards this. But there are limits that are not just -- not really about the manufacturing but is also the marketing and the time that is required in order to introduce new lines in the market without creating a mass unconscious in the customer. Thank you, Omar."

35576,607251084,1759628,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. I w",1179,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. 
I will first state the obvious. Tiffany's results in recent quarters have not been up to the long-term growth standards we have set for ourselves. Regional results in the first quarter were slightly softer than what we expected. Worldwide sales declined 3% following a strong 15% increase in last year's first quarter. However, worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis were equal to the prior year with sales growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe on the same basis, offset by a decline in the Americas and then changed the results in Japan. 
We believe that external pressures had a significant impact on sales. For example, we believe that the strong dollar had a meaningful impact on first quarter retail sales attributed to foreign tourists in the Americas. Our internal estimates indicate that those tourist sales represent a low double-digit percentage of our American retail sales. Those sales were down approximately 25% from a year ago with sharper declines among Chinese tourists, which in fact were even more pronounced than declines in the second half of last year. 
However, our internal estimates also indicate that constant currency retail sales to local customers, which we believe are much more -- much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, were up by approximately 3% from a global basis during the first quarter with strong growth in mainland China being particularly noteworthy. This is why we remain focused on the strategic priorities which are within our control and then identified and are aggressively pursuing numerous ways we can enhance the excitement and relevance of this amazing brand. We strongly believe that effectively executing our strategic priorities, first and foremost, will be what takes this company to new heights of success. 
Let me give you a few examples. Our strategy to renew our product offerings continues to gain momentum. After successfully launching the platinum- and diamond-based PAPER FLOWERS collection last year, we are continuing to add new designs to this collection. Another major collection we recently introduced is the TIFFANY TRUE collection, featuring an innovative modern engagement ring design with a new diamond cut in a gold or platinum setting as well as with accompanying band rings. 
Finally, on a smaller scale, we have recently introduced Tiffany Love Bugs that complements our Return to Tiffany collection. Importantly, we have also included a gold version of Return to Tiffany Love Bugs in addition to silver, which is consistent with our strategy to continue driving higher-than-average transaction value across all of our product categories. And I can tell you that we have a substantial amount of newness planned for the second half of the year with additions to the Tiffany T and HardWear collections among others. And I'm also pleased that we now have even greater visibility into our product innovation pipeline for the next several years. And I'm excited about what is being developed. 
We are also steadily progressing with our strategy to amplify and evolve brand message. Focused on our most iconic collections and especially Tiffany T, the current campaign showcases beautiful Tiffany jewels worn by a cast of some of the most recognizable and richly diverse fashion models in the world. The brand's unique joyful attitude and iconic blue color made the campaign unexpectedly Tiffany. Importantly, the campaign is truly a digital-first campaign with most of the investment and assets directly -- directed towards social and other digital media. 
I should also highlight the publicity we have received and substantial impressions that were made in social media after Lady Gaga appeared at the Academy Awards in late February wearing the legendary 128-carat Tiffany Diamond. And we are making substantial progress to enhance our in-store presentations. We launched our global display enhancement initiative last year to add fresh and innovative elements of visual merchandising to our stores in North America. And we are now on track to complete the rollout of that initiative to all stores globally by this fall. 
We have also added some new stores in the first quarter. We opened our first store in Washington, D.C. in the new CityCenterDC luxury complex. We also completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, when we opened a magnificent new store at the corner of Pitt and King Streets in Sydney. We are continuing our exciting development in mainland China this year. And total sales continued to grow by a double-digit rate in local currency in the first quarter. Our recent initiatives included relocating our store in Beijing's China World to an exceptional location with a redesigned 6,000-square foot format, showcasing an innovative and distinctive retail experience that encourages interaction and self-expression. 
Also we opened a concept store in Japan on Tokyo's Cat Street. Located in Harajuku, the experiential design for Tiffany at Cat Street showcases the wit, creativity and timelessness of the brand. From jewelry to home and accessories, the store offers a thematically curated selection and presentation of iconic designs and even houses a café at the top floor. In terms of our projects to transform the New York flagship store into 21st century experience, construction has begun on the adjacent space with an anticipated completion of that temporary space by year-end. Once completed, we will shift most of our retailing space to that adjacent location for 2020 and 2021. 
Complementing the store base, we relaunched all of our global websites in the first quarter which, going forward, will allow us to offer a blended experience of content and commerce with enhancements that we expect will enable us to more effectively test, personalize and optimize content and ultimately ensure a better customer experience in the long term. In addition, for the first time, customers in the U.S. can now order online from a select assortment of band engagement rings. 
While we are understandably excited about these new capabilities, we did make the conscious decision to suspend digital marketing for a portion of the first quarter to ensure that our newly revamped websites could handle the load balances associated with a complete digital replatforming. And we believe that decision, while prudent, negatively impacted first quarter sales, although e-commerce sales still grew faster than total company sales. It is probably also worth a second to mention that we are getting closer to introducing an e-commerce-enabled website in China, which we believe will further strengthen our business in this important market. 
So in closing, we are pursuing a substantial number of initiatives to benefit our customers and drive sales and earnings growth as we move forward on this long journey. We certainly do not believe that first quarter results are indicative of our longer-term earnings power and recent external pressures will not sway us from the growth opportunities available to us. 
And now Mark Erceg has a few comments before we open up the call to all the questions."
35576,607251084,1759628,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 04, 2019",2019-06-04,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign to",850,"Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign tourist spending and meaningful FX headwinds followed by stronger second half results as year-over-year comparisons get easier, foreign exchange pressures lessen and the bulk of our 2019 new product launches and associated marketing support reaches the market. 
Since we expected first quarter sales to be under pressure, and we knew that the incremental strategic investment spending, which began during the second quarter of 2018, needed to be fully annualized, we correctly anticipated downward earnings pressure in the first quarter, which is consistent with the results we just released. Gross margin was below last year, which reflected negative sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales as well as shifts in sales mix, including an increase in higher price point jewelry that earns a lower gross margin and an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that earn as little if any gross margin, partially offset by lower product-related costs. 
SG&A expense growth was restrained in the quarter through tight expense management, including cost savings from our global procurement program, labor cost reductions through organizational efficiencies and, of course, variable cost savings tied directly to sales. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due primarily to an increase in estimated 2018 Foreign Derived Intangible Income benefit we realized as a result of recently issued U.S. Treasury guidance. That said, we continue to believe that our all-in effective tax rate for the full year will be in the low 20s. 
Net inventories as of April 30 were 6% above the prior year as we continue to work off higher-than-expected post holiday levels. But importantly, we continue to expect minimal year-over-year growth by year-end. Our balance sheet remains strong, having finished the quarter with $763 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with just over $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This enables us to reinvest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders. For example, we are spending more on capital expenditures for the next couple of years to support the transformation of our New York flagship store while we also continue to invest in the modernization of our IT infrastructure. 
At the same time that we're investing in the future of our business, we are returning cash to shareholders as evidenced by $25 million we spent during the quarter to repurchase approximately 270,000 shares of common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which is consistent with our stated objective to move over time our dividend payout ratio closer to 50%. This will be the 18th dividend increase in the past 17 years. 
Operationally, we are pleased with the progress being made with our IT system upgrades. Since our last earnings release, we have upgraded our e-commerce digital platforms and activated a new advanced supply chain planning system, which should enable more sophisticated load management and production scheduling across our suppliers and our vertically integrated manufacturing network. 
So all in all, we just reported an admittedly soft but mostly anticipated and overall productive start to 2019, during which a number of strategic initiatives continued to advance. From a guidance standpoint and relative to the top line, we are being impacted by further declines in foreign tourist spending, where we continue to look for low single-digit sales growth for the year. Relative to the bottom line, we implemented some modest pricing actions towards the end of the first quarter and have plans for strict cost control management throughout the balance of the year. But we are being affected by the softness in foreign tourist spending and, to a lesser extent, the recent imposition of higher tariff rates on jewelry products that we export from the U.S. into China and our decision to not meaningfully increase our retail prices in China at the present time. 
Since we are determined to properly support and protect our business in mainland China against our principal competitors, we do not have to contend with higher import costs into China based on their unique sourcing locations. And after taking everything else we have discussed today into account, we think it is prudent to modestly widen our earnings per share guidance range from mid-single-digit growth to low to mid-single-digit growth. And of course, as we mentioned on our last call, we should not lose sight of the fact that EPS growth in 2019 is expected to be affected by incremental expenses tied to the New York flagship store renovations, which we estimate at $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2019 versus $0.07 per share last year as well as a change in accounting standards that no longer allows us to recognize approximately $8 million per year of deferred gains on previous sale-leasebacks. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Mark."

That is easier for holiday, not only the ground floor but the entire flagship -- current flagship building will be open. And now let's go to the other questions that are more articulated. So first of all, it's about the tourists in the U.S. The tourists in the U.S. represent a low double-digit percentage of our total sales in the U.S. And we have you seen a sharper decrease to sales to tourists in the U.S. in the range of 25%, even sharper for Chinese tourists. And this is in line -- it's not even a little bit stronger trend than we have seen in the past couple of quarters. 
Now this is -- of course, it has a negative impact on the comp sales in the U.S. because double-digit percentage of sales depends on tourists. And so of course, this affects the overall.

I'd tell you, the tourism one is hard for us to be overly predictive of. But we are trend-takers, so to speak. Just like we take spot FX and presume that what holds through balance of the year, we're kind of doing the same thing here with the tourism. We're not assuming things get any better, but we're also not necessarily assuming things get any worse, just that the trends that we had seen continue on. Now realistically and practically, we are hoping that once we get to the third quarter, the rate of reduction that we've seen in Chinese tourism, we're hoping that, that moderates because frankly with such a swift decline, it would be kind of hard to believe that year-over-year, we could see a continuing step-down of that magnitude. But at this point, we're not being overly optimistic. We don't have our second half plans predicated upon tourism suddenly coming back to us, which is something we can't control. 
As for the gross margin, when you think about what happened in the first quarter, there was really three factors. One was the wholesale sale of diamonds, which we really can't be overly predictive of. We get the rough boxes in, sometimes we have to reprocess those and push them back out if it's not Tiffany quality. We also saw some negative sales leverage on fixed costs. I would expect that to continue for another quarter or so. But certainly by the second half of the year when we're ramping back up for our second half product launches and things, we expect our factory loads to be much more balanced. So that should be kind of a temporary phenomenon. And then as far as the mix is concerned, we talked about was the fact that we sold a lot of additional higher price point items in the first quarter. And that's really at the end of the day probably a good thing for us. So as we think about the full year on a margin basis, we knew the first half would be tough. We expect to make up ground in the second half. And so when the dust settles out on the full year based on the guidance we've given, we would expect operating margin to be flat to maybe slightly up as we sit here today."

We will continue with this approach of introducing newness, mainly in gold, at a very accelerated pace. And so far, even if it is only 1 year, we are seeing that in our results, the growth in revenues comes from the newness and especially from the newness in gold. And the higher the price, the higher the performance. 
So this, we find it very reassuring for the strategy we have taken and also reinforcing the brand and clearing, if anybody has a doubt that Tiffany is a luxury brand, clearing definitely this out because we are seeing increasing average transaction value and strong performance in the gold and more precious categories. We believe this is positive for the brand in the short term and the long term. And the launches that we are foreseeing for the second part of the year continue in the same strategy."

So with respect to the first portion of what you asked, when you think about when we really started stepping up our investment spending profile, last year, it was principally in the second quarter. So we said that we needed to really lap and annualize that. We specifically asked were there any costs or charges or investments in the first quarter of this year that maybe slipped a little bit toward the second quarter or third quarter. And Alex commented in our prepared remarks about the decision to send some digital marketing elements as we stood up our 13 global e-commerce-enabled sites. So that arguably was a little bit of a push. 
From this point forward, I would say the run rate you're going to see as far as investment spending, marketing support, in-store [ dollars ], I think it will be fairly steady and constant from Q2 through the balance of the year. And then from that point, we already elevated and stepped up the amount of spending we think is appropriate in order to sustainably grow the business. So I think at this point, most of that is now behind us, which is important. 
As far as the cost takeout efforts are concerned, however, I think I would tell you that we felt [ positively ] with respect to that. The global procurement group has been around for a number of years. They continue to do really good work. We're standing up a source-to-pay system as we speak, which will give them visibility into all of our global spend pools, which is something they haven't had up to this point in time. We're doing a lot of work with our suppliers and our supplier enablement and putting supplier scorecards in place, doing a lot more diligent tracking as it relates to that. The jewelry design and innovation workshop we talked about before has been a great intervention, where we bring the model makers and the designers and the engineering group together to let us do rapid costing, build rapid prototypes, allows us to do [ ship costs ] modeling. 
I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the advanced planning system we just stood up on the manufacturing side of the house. This was a multimillion-dollar project that spanned well over a year and took a lot of multifunctional participation. But it's going to allow us to optimize our inventory levels. It's going to allow us to make better make-versus-buy decisions. It will enable much more sophisticated capacity planning. I mean frankly, we've been managing our production loads on Excel spreadsheets up to this point in time across our factory network. So being the master scheduling across all those facilities and vendors, detail the production scheduling for each manufacturer, those types of things are big enablers for us. So I could go on. But I think that should give you some sense of the things that we're working against."

As far as the other tourism is concerned, again I mentioned that, that's going to fall off in the fourth quarter. And that has continued as well. Within the quarter itself, I'm really hesitant to say anything about month-to-month because again this is internal data. This is some work that we do.

Now in Jewelry Collections, as I said before, we have seen a strong performance in our newest, most iconic and most precious lines. Of course, the 4% is made of this strong growth and also negative on silver, less expensive items and, of course, products that were older in our assortment. But I'm -- while the 4% may seem just a low single digit, actually for me strategically, it's very important that is the average of some very strong growth in the lines in which we have invested for, for the future. So for me, that is strategically very important. 
The 2% negative in Engagement Jewelry, actually it's a little bit -- it's a flattish kind of situation. We have to also remember that we are comparing to last year when we grew at constant exchange rate 11% and engagement plus 11%, that was astonishing last year. So I see it as performance. We have benefited of the launch of T True. But consider that T True engagement ring is now, for the time being, rolled out in the markets in the higher carats and not yet in smaller carats.

And because also Europe, in France notably but also other markets, had been negatively affected for that tourist component. Now in terms of engagement, I'm looking mostly at the other factors. It is the engagement on social media. This is why I -- in my prepared remarks, I underscored how the initiative, for example, of the red carpet, Lady Gaga and also the new advertising campaign, where we are using very well-known models, like Carolyn Murphy, Mica Argañaraz, Kendall Jenner, et cetera.

And so for the second part of the year, but I would say also for the first part of next year, we have a pretty robust pipeline of new products. We will focus for the second part of this year on existing iconic lines, like Tiffany T, like HardWear, where we have a very good response by customers and where we believe there is the opportunity to injecting some newness that can be very, very effective. At the same time, we will launch also some new lines in very specific segments that probably are not going to be huge in terms of sales but are very meaningful for the brand positioning and they're totally accretive. And as soon as we will get closer to the date, I will be pleased to share which are these lines. But let me say, I feel very confident about the work we are doing. It's -- I can imagine that in some of you, there is a sense of frustration because you hear me being positive about these introductions. And on the other side, you see sales that at constant rates are basically flat. 
Now the reason is that, let aside the tourism and all this, there is a factor that to modify, to evolve the assortment of a brand like Tiffany, it takes time. And we have to keep on going and adding newness. We are seeing that newness is paying back. But of course, the customer in front of the newness prefers the newness and leaves aside the existing products. So we will see -- we have to reach the critical mass in newness in order to give to the customer an option in our stores that is wider than it is now. And we are working very fast towards this. But there are limits that are not just -- not really about the manufacturing but is also the marketing and the time that is required in order to introduce new lines in the market without creating a mass unconscious in the customer.

Let me start by saying right up front that our second quarter results were mixed.

Let me start by saying right up front that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line, admittedly, came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations, but we are encouraged by the slight over delivery we achieved on the bottom line versus our internal forecast, which Mark will elaborate on during his prepared remarks. But first, let's spend some time putting our second quarter results in context. Global reported sales did drop by  3%, but this was against the backdrop that included last year's strong 12% increase, a significant decline in both sales attributed to Chinese and all other tourists and meaningful disruption in Hong Kong. 
Let's take a few additional on each of these. Last year, during the second quarter of 2018, we generated significant U.S. and global attention behind the holistic launch of PAPER FLOWERS in New York and our BELIEVE IN LOVE campaign, which we believe drove a meaningful increase in both traffic and sales. We expect similar excitement behind our main product applications this year but those will take place during the later stages of the third and the early part of the fourth quarter.
Second quarter sales results were also impacted by a continued sharp decline in sales to both Chinese and all other tourists, which we believe lowers our reported sales by a couple of percentage points. 
In Hong Kong, where we have 10 stores, and we achieved our fourth biggest market relative to total sales only after the United States, Japan and mainland China, has been presented with a unique set of challenges. Obviously, we hope for a quick resolution being experienced there but in the meantime, we must acknowledge that the current situation is taking a toll on our business. In fact, we estimate that during the second quarter, we lost nearly [ 6 full ] selling days due to unplanned store closures. Despite all of this, our internal estimates indicate that during the second quarter, we grew constant currency retail sales to local customers on a global basis by 2%, which we believe is a much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, and within which we once again posted strong double-digit growth with local customers in mainland China. 
Having provided some short-term commentary on the second quarter, let's now pivot to something much more important, our near- and long-term effort to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth rates consistent with our position as global luxury jeweler. We are now 6 quarters into the long and exciting journey we effectively began at the start of fiscal 2018 when we took a bold decision to meaningfully increase investment spending to support our 6 key focus areas. As we stated then and as we continue to believe now, those investments have been carefully designed to be self-enforcing and to working constantly over time in order to ultimately allow us to consistently deliver sustainable top line sales growth. We have also heard that repeatedly stated that we do not expect to deliver sustainable top line sales growth until we have been able to introduce a sufficient number of distinct new products, amplify and evolve marketing message with sufficient impact as to attract a significant number of new customers, reactivate lost ones while continuing to delight our existing customers. Upgrade the key aspects of our physical store network while experiential elements to our in-store environment such as indoor merchandising, jewelry, and et cetera. And develope through enabling technologies a seamless omnichannel customer experience. We are making good progress on all of these fronts. However, as an illustration, since we believe there are inherent limits on the maximum amount of product newness we can be properly supported with 350 degree marketing and PR campaigns as well as robust in-store execution, coming confusing or distracting for our customers, we estimate that it may take until fiscal 2021 to properly refresh our product assortment with enough newness to generate balance and sustainable growth across our entire product portfolio.
We are committed to reinvigorating the business the right way as we aim for industry-leading levels of shareholder value creation, which we believe define long-term success. In the meantime, it may admittedly be a bit hard to see how the strategic investment decisions we have made so far have positively impacted the business, given timing shifts on new product launches as compared to last year, microeconomic noise from lower tourist spending and the disruption taking place in Hong Kong. 
Therefore, we thought it might be helpful to spend a few minutes talking about how all of the decisions we have made over the past 18 months are working together in mainland China, a key strategic market, which from the beginning of this journey, we have identified to receive a high level of management focus and investment. 
For example, mainland China is where we chose to disproportionately increase marketing spending and media penetration last year. It was also mainland China where we took the decision to speed up our retail foundation information technology platform first back in the first quarter of 2018. 
During the first half of 2019, we increased high jewelry presence at our Beijing China store as well that's in a number of additional major stores such as Shanghai and Beijing Then during the second quarter of 2019, we sold through limited quantities of specialty diamond pendant on which [ 4 520 ] or I love you day supported by a famous Chinese actor with nearly 30 million of followers. And we enabled e-commerce on our tiffany.cn website for the first time. We believe that all of these actions plus improvements in the relevance of our message into Chinese consumers and the launch of PAPER FLOWERS last fall have enabled us to significantly improve our scores as surveyed by a third party in mainland China across critical consumer segments, such as self-purchasing women, high spenders and gifters. This, in turn, allowed us to improve our overall brand power ranking in China from fourth to second place during the past year. And even more importantly, we believe these actions plus others have allowed us to dramatically improve our business among domestic Chinese consumers for perspective constant currency comparable sales during the first half of 2019, grew 4x faster than the first half of 2018 and second quarter 2019 sales grew more than  25%. 
In order to maintain this momentum, we have a number of real exciting and strategically important initiatives. Some have already begun and others will take place in the second half of the year across Greater China, all of which are designed to continue to broaden our appeal among Chinese consumers. Such initiatives can be grouped in 4 key strategies. First, we are strengthening our store network by opening or upgrading our flagship stores in 3 key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. in Beijing, the location of our flagship store in China World took place in Q1. In the next 2 quarters, we expect to have 2 major flagship launches in Hong Kong and Shanghai, respectively. In Hong Kong, we plan to open a 3-floor, street-facing flagship store at 1 Peking Road in the most popular shopping area in Hong Kong among Chinese tourists, which we expect to help close the gap back with other major luxury brands, which have prominent stores in that area. In Shanghai, we plan to relocate and enlarge our store to arguably the most prominent corner location in the city at Hong Kong Plaza, an area of Shanghai where other prestigious luxury brands have significant street frontage presents. With our 3 flagship stories in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, we expect customers to be able to more fully experience the refinement assortment, service and ultimately, the power of the Tiffany & Co. brand.
Second, we are in the process of expanding our airport duty-free store network. In Q3, we plan to open the first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing airport with a partner. Next month, we plan to relocate and upgrade our directly own store at the Hong Kong airport, currently the smallest in our airport network, to a full-sized duty-free store. With these 2 stores, we expect to be able to more efficiently target the Chinese traveler retail segment.
Third, we are setting up our digital relevance with the recent e-commerce of our China company website. This is important for us to be able to form and influence, purchasing decisions of customers when they are deciding which brand and specific product to buy. Apart from the additional online sales opportunity, especially in third tier Chinese cities where we don't have a physical presence, we expect these e-commerce efforts to increase traffic and conversion rate in our physical stores and increase the effectiveness of our digital marketing. We are also increasing our weight in the Chinese digital ecosystem with the addition of WeChat limited edition digital program with the Chinese Valentine's Day and August and additional ones for the holiday and for Chinese New Year.
Fourth, we have 3 new marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2019. First, we plan to open Blue Box Cafés in both the new Hong Kong location at 1 Peking Road as well as the Ninth Shanghai at Holcomb Plaza. This will be the first permanent Blue Box Café and Tiffany stores outside of New York and just like in New York, we expect it will generate substantial customer retention and traffic. Secondly, we will be conducting a series of consumer facing documents of Tiffany across Greater China to educate consumers on our unparalleled cutting and polishing craftsmanship to reinforce our diamond authority in this market. 
Last and perhaps most importantly, on September 23, in Shanghai, we will inaugurate Tiffany & Co. vision and the largest ever Tiffany brand exhibition. The brand will celebrate its 180-year history and heritage in a unique experiential setting. Instead of being retrospective over 350 archival products, along with numerous jewelry pieces and exclusive previews from the 2019 Blue Book collection, we'll be displayed in a more experiential dramatic environment, which match the DNA of the Tiffany brand. We expect these initiatives to drastically increase the awareness and the depth of knowledge of our brand among the Chinese, including importantly, the millennial segment.
Now that we have provided additional insight on our efforts are aligning across Greater China. Let a shift back to the broader company, for which we keep progressing on the road map that we shared with you about 18 months ago. Many of you have asked us about our excitement from the second half product neatness, which will be taking place all across the world. While we don't want to take the surprise away from our customers, we can mention that we have already pre-launched a colorful new extension to our iconic Tiffany T collection. We have already pre-launched in selected stores a reinvigorated men's lineup. And as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we are moving forward with an additional fragrance offering later this year. So while we acknowledge that we still have much to do before the full effect of the strategic investments we have made and continued to make across the business are fully implemented across all product categories and key markets, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, particularly in the areas where we have dedicated the most time and resources. 
Let me now turn the call over to Mark, so we can share a few additional thoughts before we open up the call to your questions."
35576,618378690,1812494,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2019",2019-08-28,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings, and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters under want to make sure we have plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just",895,"Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings, and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters under want to make sure we have plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just a few salient matters. 
First, gross margin in the second quarter was 130 basis points below a year ago just like it was during the first quarter. There was a little bit of negative sales leverage on fixed manufacturing and other costs, but our factory loads were better balanced as we built inventory to support our second half launches in anticipation of a stronger holiday season. So the real driver of lower gross margin in the quarter was a mixed impact from a meaningful increase and high jewelry sales, which as you know is an area we've been focusing on this past year. And over the balance of the year, since our second our product launches should increase the sales mix for our gold and diamond Jewelry Collections relative to higher margin silver jewelry, we expect some additional pressure on gross margin. However, that'll be more offset by volume leverage as we expect to regain sales momentum and the absence of certain costs such as the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner we recorded in the third quarter of last year.
Looking even further out, we plan to invest even more behind our high jewelry offerings and continue introducing even more golds with and without documents and diamond products as part of our strategic efforts to put more emphasis on increasing our average unit selling price in the years ahead.
Importantly, our multiyear product and marketing plans call for moving a larger percentage of our overall sales mix to higher price points gradually by focusing on and growing golden diamond Jewelry Collections and high jewelry at a faster pace than engagement in silver jewelry. That said, it is important to note we still have plans to both engagement in silver jewelry to grow going forward just at rates below those expected to be achieved in high jewelry and across our gold and diamond jewelry collections. It is for this reason that if you might notice that we reframe the product imagery and all of our e-commerce sites along with the products featuring our digital and social campaigns recently to showcase gold and diamond Jewelry Collections more prominently. 
Second, SG&A expenses were well-contained during the second quarter with total SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales dropping from 46.3% last year to 45.2% this year, a reduction of 110 basis points. Prudent cost management, particularly on the labor line as we seek to create organizational efficiencies and ongoing global procurement efforts, which achieved a notable milestone this past quarter with the implementation of our new source-to-pay solution in United States, both contributed. We also took the decision to hold back some advertising dollars in the second quarter so that it could be more effectively deployed against our strong second half product introduction plans.
Finally, from a store network perspective and in addition to the Greater China stores out referenced earlier, we just announced the opening of 2 stores in India later this fiscal year and next year, 1 each in New Delhi and Mumbai joint venture with an India-based luxury retail leader, and we're continuing to make good progress on the New York flagship transformation. From a guidance standpoint, you may recall that the start of the year and again, during our first quarter earnings release, we called for a soft first half, followed by a rebound during the second half, which would result in full year recorded sales growth of low single digits. And while our first and second quarter sales results were a couple of points lower than we would've liked for reasons we have discussed, they have been generally speaking consistent with our overall expectations. 
As Alex mentioned earlier, tourist patterns are volatile and the situation in Hong Kong remains very fluid. In addition, the Japanese government has announced intentions to increase its sales consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% in October of this year, which is adding even more unpredictability to an already challenging macroeconomic environment. This is because in the past, business has significantly accelerated in Japan prior to consumer sales tax increases of this magnitude and then decelerated in the months thereafter. But whether or not the same phenomenon will occur this time around is very hard to predict.
Against the backdrop of these uncertainties and after balancing our first half results against our strong second half marketing and product plans, we still expect to grow full year recorded sales by low single digits. And relative to the bottom line, our guidance also remains unchanged at low to mid-single digit growth in diluted earnings per share. 
Now that said, if for example, the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong persist much longer at its current rates, we may find ourselves towards the lower end of our full year reported sales and EPS guidance range. And if the situation would deteriorate even further or if the current level of unrest was maintained for the balance of the fiscal year, we may find ourselves below the bottom end of our ranges.

For us, Hong Kong is a country or is a market that is mid-single-digit of total sales. If that is to be down by 20%, hypothetically, that would take 1 point of the full year sales block. If it was down by 40% and it was mid-single digits, it would take up 2 full points for the year just to give you some sense on it. As far as the gross margin question is concerned, we really talked about happening in the first quarter and the second quarter was very strong high jewelry sales, which has lower gross margin associated with it and we talked about that in the past. As we think about the first half, second half inflection points on gross margin, one of the key things to note we believe will restore our volume momentum, and we will get fixed cost rather just as a result of that going to the second half.

So we're still working on the plan in order to maximize the benefit not only short but also medium term. So we don't have a clearer decision at this point in time."

So the answer is yes, they will be global launches worldwide in the second part of the year. As for the kind of products, let me say there is a good range of price points. Main focus is actually on gold, plain and with diamond. But there is also newness in more entry price, both in gold as well as silver as well, of course, in the fine jewelry, $20,000 up to, I would say, $80,000 that will be introduced.

And this is something, of course, that goes beyond our control. Because it has to do with exchange rates but also simply arrival of customers for tourists in different countries, et cetera. 
Now there are ways, of course, we have put in place in order to try to address this. First of all, when there are there is less spending abroad to concentrate on the domestic market. So try to get to the consumers in the local market where they are. And in this, we have a strong position because we have a network that is truly global and so we are capable to reach out to customers if they travel but also if they stay at home. The second kind of activity we are doing and this was one of the examples I was making about China is to be present selectively but in very important airport locations. Because for example, the reason for having a store in the Beijing airport because Chinese tourists, at that point, can purchase at Beijing while they are flying out regardless of the destination of the flight. Or the reason for enlarging the Hong Kong airport store is because Hong Kong is a crucial point where people, not only as a final destination but also connecting flights and is a very nice shopping environment. So this is another activity we have -- we can do. And then the third we're doing and the third one is that of balancing our inventory. So for example, this is why I mentioned before the prepared remarks, we have shifted high jewelry assortment to mainland China distortion Shanghai and Beijing. Because as Chinese tourists down to spend less abroad, they have more availability products in the country and the way that we can partially offset the sales abroad. Know all of this is what is in our hands. Of course, all this can only partially offset the sales abroad because it's normal that somebody wended tourist tend to spend more freely, more happily with these business what we can do and we are doing it actively."

North America is probably disinterest largest opportunity for us. Last year, we had a relatively soft holiday and with the programs we had in place this year, we really believe that we should be able to do a better job of connecting with U.S. consumer and given its size, that's clearly the largest opportunity for us. Japan, we talked about Japan and the consumption tax change there. That's a little bit of a wildcard back in 2014 when the consumption tax went from 5% to 8%. We saw a meaningful pull forward of business in the 2-month period prior to the implementation of that tax increase and then it kind of fell away. So how that rates over the third and fourth quarters were a little bit of a wildcard for us.

It's important to point out just how much movement there has been. If you go back to before July 1st of 2018 and you look at the product types, whether it's silver or yellow gold, or white gold or platinum or what have you, all in blended weighted average tariff was roughly 28%. Then, in July of 2018 with tariff cuts that went into effect, that dropped down to a high single-digit percentage. We dialed back around September, mid-September of '18. It went up to the mid-teens. And by June of this year, we're basically back to the mid-20s. With the current discussion taking place, what could be triggered in December would actually take us above where we were when this whole thing started. So instead of being 28, we could be in the low 30s potentially. So it's an area where watching very, very closely because of the way we shift products typically from the U.S., there is bit of a lag effect and when that tends to hit us, we don't expect large additional impact if those December tariffs will take effect at this fiscal. That said, we have used some pricing in the past to help mitigate some of these areas. But a surprising also would go in the opposite direction to follow the tariffs down, we had to be very flexible and responsible the biggest concern we have frankly on a longer-term basis is the tariff differential between companies such as ourselves to manufacture most things in the U.S. versus some of the European competitors. And that's where when we've got to the  last quarter, we talked about the fact that we did you feel appropriate to take pricing actions and maybe do that laterally and get ourselves new and competitive price situation. So we did have to eat that last round of tariffs. Whether or not we have to do something like that, again, we have to make that determination over the next many weeks and months. But for now, for the fiscal, I think, we're in a reasonably good place. But longer term, it's an area that we obviously have a lot of concern about and are watching very closely."

Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved",1972,"Thanks, Jason, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved on the bottom line versus our internal forecast, which Mark will elaborate on during his prepared remarks. 
But first, let's spend some time putting our second quarter sales results in context. Global reported sales did drop by  3%. But this was against a backdrop that included last year's strong 12% increase, a significant decline in both sales attributed to Chinese and all other tourists and meaningful business disruption in Hong Kong. 
Let's take a few additional seconds on each of this. Last year, during the second quarter of 2018, we generated significant U.S. and global attention behind the holistic launch of PAPER FLOWERS in New York and our ""Believe in Dreams"" campaign, which we believe drove a meaningful increase in both traffic and sales. We expect similar excitement behind our main product activations this year. But those will take place during the later stages of the third and the early part of the fourth quarter.
Second quarter sales results were also impacted by a continued sharp decline in sales to both Chinese and all other tourists, which we believe lowered our reported sales by a couple percentage points. In Hong Kong, where we have 10 stores and which is our fourth biggest market relative to total sales only after the United States, Japan and mainland China, has been presented with a unique set of challenges. Obviously, we hope for a quick and peaceful resolution to the unrest being experienced there. But in the meantime, we must acknowledge that the current situation is taking a toll on our business. In fact, we estimate that during the second quarter, we lost nearly 6 full selling days due to unplanned store closures. 
Despite all of this, our internal estimates indicate that during the second quarter, we grew constant currency retail sales to local customers on a global basis by 2%, which we believe is a much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential and within which we once again posted strong double-digit growth with local customers in mainland China.  
Having provided some short-term commentary on the second quarter, let's now pivot to something much more important, our mid- and long-term efforts to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth rates consistent with our position as global luxury jeweler. We are now 6 quarters into the long and exciting journey we effectively began at the start of fiscal 2018, when we took the bold decision to meaningfully increase investment spending to support our 6 key focus areas. As we stated then and as we continue to believe now, those investments have been carefully designed to be self-enforcing and to work in concert with each other over time in order to ultimately allow us to consistently deliver sustainable top line sales growth. 
You have also heard us repeatedly state that we do not expect to deliver sustainable top line sales growth until we have been able to introduce a sufficient number of distinctive new products; amplify and evolve marketing message with sufficient impact as to attract a significant number of new customers; reactivate lapsed ones while continuing to delight our existing customers; upgrade key aspects of our physical store network while also adding experiential elements to our in-store environment, such as visual merchandising, jewelry styling bars, et cetera; and develop through enabling technologies a seamless omni-channel customer experience. 
We are making good progress on all of these fronts. However, as an illustration, since we believe there are inherent limits on the maximum amount of product newness we can be properly supported with 360-degree marketing and PR campaigns as well as robust in-store execution without becoming confusing or distracting for our customers, we estimate that it may take until fiscal 2021 to properly refresh our product assortment with enough newness to generate balanced and sustainable growth across our entire product portfolio.
We are committed to reinvigorating the business the right way as we aim for industry-leading levels of shareholder value creation, which we believe define long-term success. In the meantime, it may admittedly be a bit hard to see how the strategic investment decisions we have made so far are positively impacting the business, given timing shifts in new product launches as compared to last year, macroeconomic noise from lower tourism spending and the disruption taking place in Hong Kong. 
Therefore, we thought it might be helpful to spend a few minutes talking about how all of the decisions we have made over the past 18 months are working together in mainland China, a key strategic market, which from the beginning of this journey we have identified to receive a high level of management focus and investment. For example, mainland China is where we chose to disproportionately increase marketing spending and media penetration last year. It was also mainland China where we took the decision to stand up our retail foundation information technology platform first back in the first quarter of 2018. 
During the first half of 2019, we increased the high jewelry presence at our Beijing, China World store as well as in a number of additional major stores, such as Shanghai IFC and Beijing Shin Kong Place. Then during the second quarter of 2019, we sold through limited quantities of special Tiffany Keys diamond pendants on WeChat for 520 or I Love You Day, supported by Liu Haoran, a famous Chinese actor with nearly 30 million Weibo followers. And we enabled e-commerce on our tiffany.cn website for the first time. 
We believe that all of these actions plus improvements in the relevance of our message into Chinese consumers and the launch of PAPER FLOWERS last fall have enabled us to significantly improve our brand power scores as surveyed by a third party in mainland China across critical consumer segments, such as self-purchasing women, high spenders and gifters. This, in turn, allowed us to improve our overall brand power ranking in China from fourth to second place during the past year. And even more importantly, we believe these actions plus others have allowed us to dramatically improve our business among domestic Chinese consumers. For perspective, constant currency comparable sales during the first half of 2019 grew 4 times faster than the first half of 2018 and second quarter 2019 sales grew more than 25%.  
In order to maintain this momentum, we have a number of real exciting and strategically important initiatives. Some have already begun and others will take place in the second half of the year across Greater China, all of which are designed to continue to broaden our appeal among Chinese consumers. Such initiatives can be grouped in 4 key strategies. 
First, we are strengthening our store network by opening or upgrading our flagship stores in 3 key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In Beijing, the relocation and upgrade of our flagship store in China World took place in Q1. In the next 2 quarters, we expect to have 2 major flagship launches in Hong Kong and Shanghai, respectively. In Hong Kong, we plan to open a 3-floor, street-facing flagship store at 1 Peking Road in the most popular shopping area in Hong Kong among Chinese tourists, which we expect to help close the gap with other major luxury brands, which have prominent stores in that area. In Shanghai, we plan to relocate and enlarge our store to arguably the most prominent corner location in the city at Hong Kong Plaza, an area of Shanghai where other prestigious luxury brands have significant street frontage presence. With our 3 flagship stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, we expect customers to be able to more fully experience the refinement, assortment, service and ultimately the power of the Tiffany & Co. brand.
Second, we are in the process of expanding our airport duty-free store network. In Q3, we plan to open the first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing airport with a partner. Next month, we plan to relocate and upgrade our directly owned store at the Hong Kong airport, currently the smallest in our airport network, to a full-sized duty-free store. With these 2 stores, we expect to be able to more efficiently target the Chinese traveler retail segment.
Third, we are setting up our digital relevance with the recent e-commerce enablement of our China company website. This is important for us to be able to inform and influence purchasing decisions of customers when they are deciding which brand and specific product to buy. Apart from the additional online sales opportunity, especially in third-tier Chinese cities where we don't have a physical presence, we expect these e-commerce efforts to increase traffic and conversion rate in our physical stores and increase the effectiveness of our digital marketing. We are also increasing our weight in the Chinese digital ecosystem with the addition of WeChat limited edition program we did for Chinese Valentine's Day in August and additional ones for the holidays and for Chinese New Year.
Fourth, we have 3 new marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2019. First, we plan to open Blue Box Cafés in both the new Hong Kong location at 1 Peking Road as well as the next Shanghai flagship at Hong Kong Plaza. This will be the first permanent Blue Box Cafés in Tiffany stores outside of New York. And just as in New York, we expect it will generate substantial customer retention and store traffic. Secondly, we will be conducting a series of consumer-facing [ Diamonds of Tiffany ] events across Greater China to educate consumers on our unparalleled cutting and polishing craftsmanship and to reinforce our diamond authority in this market. 
Last and perhaps most importantly, on September 23 in Shanghai, we will inaugurate Tiffany & Co. Vision & Virtuosity, the largest-ever Tiffany brand exhibition. The brand will celebrate its over 180-year history and heritage in a unique experiential setting. Instead of being just a retrospective, over 350 archival products, along with numerous other high jewelry pieces and exclusive previews from the 2019 Blue Book high jewelry collection, will be displayed in a more experiential thematic environment, which match the DNA of the Tiffany brand. We expect these initiatives to drastically increase the awareness and the depth of knowledge of our brand among the Chinese, including importantly the millennial segment.
Now that we have provided additional insight on how our efforts are aligning across Greater China, let's shift back to the broader company for which we keep progressing on the road map that we shared with you about 18 months ago. Many of you have asked us about our excitement from the second half product newness, which will be taking place all across the world. While we don't want to take the surprise away from our customers, we can mention that we have already prelaunched a colorful new extension to our iconic Tiffany T collection. We have also already prelaunched in selected stores a reinvigorated men's lineup. And as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we are moving forward with an additional fragrance offering later this year. 
So while we acknowledge that we still have much to do before the full effect of the strategic investments we have made and continue to make across the business are fully implemented across all product categories and key markets, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, particularly in the areas where we have dedicated the most time and resources. 
Let me now turn the call over to Mark, so he can share a few additional thoughts before we open up the call to your questions."
35576,618378690,1812596,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2019",2019-08-28,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just",907,"Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just a few salient matters. 
First, gross margin in the second quarter was 130 basis points below a year ago, just like it was during the first quarter. There was a little bit of negative sales leverage on fixed manufacturing and other costs, but our factory loads were better balanced as we built inventory to support our second half launches in anticipation of a stronger holiday season. So the real driver of lower gross margin in the quarter was a mix impact from a meaningful increase in high jewelry sales, which as you know is an area we've been focusing on this past year. 
And over the balance of the year, since our second half product launches should increase the sales mix for our gold and diamond jewelry collections relative to higher margin silver jewelry, we'd expect some additional pressure on gross margin. However, that should be more than offset by volume leverage as we expect to regain sales momentum and the absence of certain costs, such as the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner we recorded in the third quarter of last year. Looking even further out, we plan to invest even more behind our high jewelry offerings and have plans to continue introducing even more gold with and without diamonds and diamond products as part of our strategic efforts to put more emphasis on increasing our average unit selling price in the years ahead.
Importantly, our multiyear product and marketing plans call for moving a larger percentage of our overall sales mix to higher price points gradually by focusing on and growing gold and diamond jewelry collections and high jewelry at a faster pace than engagement and silver jewelry. That said, it is important to note we still have plans for both engagement and silver jewelry to grow going forward just at rates below those expected to be achieved in high jewelry and across our gold and diamond jewelry collections. It is for this reason that some of you might notice we reframed the product imagery on all of our e-commerce sites, along with the products featured in our digital and social campaigns recently to showcase gold and diamond jewelry collections more prominently. 
Second, SG&A expenses were well contained during the second quarter with total SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales dropping from 46.3% last year to 45.2% this year, a reduction of 110 basis points. Prudent cost management, particularly on the labor line as we seek to create organizational efficiencies and ongoing global procurement efforts, which achieved a notable milestone this past quarter with the implementation of our new source-to-pay solution in the United States, both contributed. We also took the decision to hold back some advertising dollars in the second quarter, so they could be more effectively deployed against our strong second half product introduction plans.
Finally, from a store network perspective and in addition to the Greater China stores Alex referenced earlier, we just announced the opening of 2 stores in India later this fiscal year and next year, 1 each in New Delhi and Mumbai through a joint venture with an India-based luxury retail leader. And we are continuing to make good progress on the New York flagship transformation. 
From a guidance standpoint, you may recall at the start of the year and again during our first quarter earnings release, we called for a soft first half followed by a rebound during the second half, which would result in full year reported sales growth of low single digits. And while our first and second quarter sales results were a couple points lower than we would have liked for reasons we have discussed, they have been generally speaking consistent with our overall expectations. 
As Alex mentioned earlier, tourism patterns are volatile and the situation in Hong Kong remains very fluid. In addition, the Japanese government has announced its intentions to increase its sales consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% in October of this year, which is adding even more unpredictability to an already challenging macroeconomic environment. This is because in the past, business has significantly accelerated in Japan prior to consumer sales tax increases of this magnitude and then decelerated in the months thereafter. But whether or not the same phenomenon will occur this time around is very hard to predict.
Against the backdrop of these uncertainties and after balancing our first half results against our strong second half marketing and product plans, we still expect to grow full year reported sales by low single digits. And relative to the bottom line, our guidance also remains unchanged at low to mid-single-digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Now that said, if, for example, the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong persists much longer at its current rate, we may find ourselves towards the lower end of our full year reported sales and EPS guidance range. And if this situation were to deteriorate even further or if the current level of unrest is maintained for the balance of the fiscal year, we may find ourselves below the bottom end of our ranges. 
So I'll now turn the call back to Jason and we can take your questions."

This is why you will remember that already in the -- when we announced the first quarter results last year, we were very clear mentioning a long and exciting journey because it was clear to me that to revamp a product assortment on a brand like Tiffany is a multiyear progress -- process. So this was -- didn't come as a surprise. And I think on the marketing, we have been acting very quickly and effectively. And we changed the communication and we keep on tweaking and changing and evolving every quarter. 
So to be honest with you, the longest time needed is, of course, in efficiencies and especially in the cultural shift, which are the 2 last priorities that we mentioned in our road map. And on efficiencies, we started seeing already some signs of managing cost more effectively in this quarter. But honestly, it's just the beginning because this is a process that will take years in order to really show a significant impact on profit. And the cultural change is something that is progressing well but is obviously the one that takes the most because it has to do with human beings and 14,000 people in the company. But I have to say it's -- I mean, there are no situations where I feel that we have a problem or where we stop. We keep on progressing on the road map we put together."

So about -- well, first of all, I would like to underline that the domestic sales to domestic customers on a global basis were positive once again, plus 2% versus plus 3% the previous quarter. And this for me is a very important point because it's the largest part of our sales and is where the brand is suited for future growth. Having said so, it's true that under 2 reasons, we have been suffering in the second quarter as well. I have to say that the decrease in sales to Chinese tourists on a global basis has been similar in the second quarter as well as in the first quarter. And the same would apply to non-Chinese tourists. Because also there, especially due to the strong dollar, there has been a decrease in sales to tourists. 
So it's something that was already there in the first quarter. And basically, it's been in the same order of magnitude also in the second quarter. Now as it refers to U.S. or North America consumers, we have experienced now since a few quarters quite softer trend. This quarter, the sales to -- domestic sales in the U.S. was slightly down. But I'm very confident that with all the marketing activities and the push we have in the second part of the year, if things remain the same, we will have a good performance because we are really focusing on the second part of the year."

So with respect to Hong Kong, it is our fourth largest market. It's critically important for us. We talked about the fact that we lost 6 store days during the second quarter. But that's just indicative of what's happening in that market today. Obviously right now, there's a lot of folks focused on various matters and shopping may not be their primary concern. For us, Hong Kong is a country or is a market that is mid-single digits of total sales. If that was to be down by 20%, hypothetically, that would take 1 point off of full year sales block. If it was down by 40% and it was mid-single digits, it would take off 2 full points for the year, just to give you some sense on it. 
As far as the gross margin question is concerned, we really talked about happening in the first quarter and the second quarter was very strong high jewelry sales, which has a lower gross margin associated with it. And we've talked about that in the past. As we think about the first half, second half inflection points on gross margin, one of the key things to note is that we believe we will restore our volume momentum and we'll get fixed cost leverage as a result of that going into the second half. We also believe that there's some onetime items, like the filing of a metal refiner that went into bankruptcy during the third quarter of last year and a few other items, some of which are related to obsolescence and a few other things that are coming to pass. We are confident that we can continue to expand our operating margin on a going-forward basis once we get to a sustainable plot of sales growth because of all the things that, that will do to the P&L as well as of our cost takeout initiatives.

As for the kind of products, let me say there is a good range of price points. Main focus is actually on gold, plain and with diamond.

And this is something, of course, that goes beyond our control. Because it has to do with exchange rates but also simply arrival of customers or tourists in different countries, et cetera. Now there are ways, of course, we have and we have put in place in order to try to address this. First of all is when there are less --  there is less spending abroad, to concentrate on the domestic market, so try to get to the consumers in the local market where they are. And in this, we have a strong position because we have a network that is truly global, and so we are capable to reach out to customers if they travel but also if they stay at home. 
The second kind of activity we are doing, and this was one of the examples I was making about China, is to be present selectively but in very important airport locations. Because, for example, the reason for having a store in the Beijing airport because Chinese tourists at that point can purchase at Beijing while they are flying out, regardless of the destination of the flight. Or the reason for enlarging the Hong Kong airport store is because Hong Kong is a crucial point where people, not only as a final destination but also the connecting flight and is a very nice shopping environment. So this is another activity we have -- we can do. 
And then the third we are doing -- and the third one is that of balancing our inventory. So for example, this is why I mentioned before during the prepared remarks, we have shifted high jewelry assortment to mainland China to stores in Shanghai and Beijing because as Chinese tourists tend to spend less abroad, then we have more availability of high jewelry products in the country in the way that we can partially offset the sales abroad. Now all of this is what is in our hands. Of course, all this can only partially offset the new sales abroad because it's normal that somebody -- when the tourist tends to spend more freely, more happily and -- but this is what we can do and we are doing it actively."

Europe, while it has been kind of flattish, we do believe that the product and marketing plans we have there will allow us to grow comparable store sales in constant currency in those regions. North America is probably the single largest opportunity for us. Last year, we had a relatively soft holiday. And with the programs we have in place this year, we really believe that we should be able to do a better job of connecting with the U.S. consumer. And given the size, that's clearly the largest opportunity for us. 
Japan, we've talked about Japan and the consumption tax change there. That's a little bit of a wildcard back. In 2014, when the consumption tax went from 5% to 8%, we saw a meaningful pull-forward of business in the 2-month period prior to the implementation of that tax increase and then it kind of fell away. So how that rates over the third and fourth quarters is a little bit of a wildcard for us.

It's important to point out just how much movement there has been. If you go back to before July 1, 2018, and you look at the product types, whether it's silver or yellow gold, white gold or platinum or what have you, our all-in blended weighted average tariff was roughly 28%. Then in July of 2018 with the tariff cuts that went into effect, that dropped down to a high single-digit percentage. We dial back around in September, mid-September of '18, it went up to the mid-teens. And by June of this year, we were basically back to the mid-20s. With the current discussion taking place, what could be triggered in December would actually take us above where we were when this whole thing started. So instead of being at 28%, we could be in the low 30s potentially. So it's an area that we're watching very, very closely. Because of the way we shift products typically from the U.S., there is bit of a lag effect in when that tends to hit us. We don't expect a large additional impact if those December tariffs, which take effect this fiscal. 
That said, we have used some pricing in the past to help mitigate some of these areas. But as the pricing also would go in the opposite direction to follow the tariffs down, we've had to be very flexible and responsive in the marketplace. The biggest concern that we have frankly on a longer-term basis is the tariff differential between a company such as ourselves who manufactures most things in the U.S. versus some of the European competitors. And that's where, when we got together last quarter, we talked about the fact that we didn't feel it would be appropriate to take pricing actions and maybe do that unilaterally and get ourselves into an uncompetitive price situation. So we did have to eat that last round of tariffs. Whether or not we have to do something like that again, we'll have to make that determination over the next many weeks and months. But for now for the fiscal, I think we're in a reasonably good place. But longer term, it's an area that we obviously have a lot of concern about and are watching very closely."

Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved",1970,"Thanks, Jason, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved on the bottom line versus our internal forecast, which Mark will elaborate on during his prepared remarks. 
But first, let's spend some time putting our second quarter sales results in context. Global reported sales did drop by 3%, but this was against a backdrop that included last year's strong 12% increase, a significant decline in both sales attributed to Chinese and all other tourists and meaningful business disruption in Hong Kong. 
Let's take a few additional seconds on each of these. Last year, during the second quarter of 2018, we generated significant U.S. and global attention behind the holistic launch of PAPER FLOWERS in New York and our ""Believe in Dreams"" campaign, which we believe drove a meaningful increase in both traffic and sales. We expect similar excitement behind our main product activations this year. But those will take place during the later stages of the third and the early part of the fourth quarter.
Second quarter sales results were also impacted by a continued sharp decline in sales to both Chinese and all other tourists, which we believe lowered our reported sales by a couple percentage points. In Hong Kong, where we have 10 stores and which is our fourth biggest market relative to total sales only after the United States, Japan and mainland China, has been presented with a unique set of challenges. Obviously, we hope for a quick and peaceful resolution to the unrest being experienced there. But in the meantime, we must acknowledge that the current situation is taking a toll on our business. In fact, we estimate that during the second quarter, we lost nearly 6 full selling days due to unplanned store closures. 
Despite all of this, our internal estimates indicate that during the second quarter, we grew constant currency retail sales to local customers on a global basis by 2%, which we believe is a much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential and within which we once again posted strong double-digit growth with local customers in mainland China.  
Having provided some short-term commentary on the second quarter, let's now pivot to something much more important, our mid- and long-term efforts to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth rates consistent with our position as global luxury jeweler. We are now 6 quarters into the long and exciting journey we effectively began at the start of fiscal 2018, when we took the bold decision to meaningfully increase investment spending to support our 6 key focus areas. As we stated then and as we continue to believe now, those investments have been carefully designed to be self-enforcing and to work in concert with each other over time in order to ultimately allow us to consistently deliver sustainable top line sales growth. 
You have also heard us repeatedly state that we do not expect to deliver sustainable top line sales growth until we have been able to introduce a sufficient number of distinctive new products; amplify and evolve marketing message with sufficient impact as to attract a significant number of new customers; reactivate lapsed ones while continuing to delight our existing customers; upgrade key aspects of our physical store network while also adding experiential elements to our in-store environment, such as visual merchandising, jewelry styling bars, et cetera; and develop through enabling technologies a seamless omni-channel customer experience. 
We are making good progress on all of these fronts. However, as an illustration, since we believe there are inherent limits on the maximum amount of product newness we can be properly supported with 360-degree marketing and PR campaigns as well as robust in-store execution without becoming confusing or distracting for our customers, we estimate that it may take until fiscal 2021 to properly refresh our product assortment with enough newness to generate balanced and sustainable growth across our entire product portfolio.
We are committed to reinvigorating the business the right way as we aim for industry-leading levels of shareholder value creation, which we believe define long-term success. In the meantime, it may admittedly be a bit hard to see how the strategic investment decisions we have made so far are positively impacting the business, given timing shifts in new product launches as compared to last year, macroeconomic noise from lower tourism spending and the disruption taking place in Hong Kong. 
Therefore, we thought it might be helpful to spend a few minutes talking about how all of the decisions we have made over the past 18 months are working together in mainland China, a key strategic market, which from the beginning of this journey we have identified to receive a high level of management focus and investment. For example, mainland China is where we chose to disproportionately increase marketing spending and media penetration last year. It was also mainland China where we took the decision to stand up our retail foundation information technology platform first back in the first quarter of 2018. 
During the first half of 2019, we increased the high jewelry presence at our Beijing, China World store as well as in a number of additional major stores, such as Shanghai IFC and Beijing Shin Kong Place. Then during the second quarter of 2019, we sold through limited quantities of special Tiffany Keys diamond pendants on WeChat for 5/20 or I Love You Day, supported by Liu Haoran, a famous Chinese actor with nearly 30 million Weibo followers. And we enabled e-commerce on our tiffany.cn website for the first time. 
We believe that all of these actions plus improvements in the relevance of our message into Chinese consumers and the launch of PAPER FLOWERS last fall have enabled us to significantly improve our brand power scores as surveyed by a third party in mainland China across critical consumer segments, such as self-purchasing women, high spenders and gifters. This, in turn, allowed us to improve our overall brand power ranking in China from fourth to second place during the past year. And even more importantly, we believe these actions plus others have allowed us to dramatically improve our business among domestic Chinese consumers. For perspective, constant currency comparable sales during the first half of 2019 grew 4 times faster than the first half of 2018 and second quarter 2019 sales grew more than 25%.  
In order to maintain this momentum, we have a number of real exciting and strategically important initiatives. Some have already begun and others will take place in the second half of the year across Greater China, all of which are designed to continue to broaden our appeal among Chinese consumers. Such initiatives can be grouped in 4 key strategies. 
First, we are strengthening our store network by opening or upgrading our flagship stores in 3 key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In Beijing, the relocation and upgrade of our flagship store in China World took place in Q1. In the next 2 quarters, we expect to have 2 major flagship launches in Hong Kong and Shanghai, respectively. In Hong Kong, we plan to open a 3-floor, street-facing flagship store at 1 Peking Road in the most popular shopping area in Hong Kong among Chinese tourists, which we expect to help close the gap with other major luxury brands, which have prominent stores in that area. In Shanghai, we plan to relocate and enlarge our store to arguably the most prominent corner location in the city at Hong Kong Plaza, an area of Shanghai where other prestigious luxury brands have significant street frontage presence. With our 3 flagship stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, we expect customers to be able to more fully experience the refinement, assortment, service and ultimately the power of the Tiffany & Co. brand.
Second, we are in the process of expanding our airport duty-free store network. In Q3, we plan to open the first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing airport with a partner. Next month, we plan to relocate and upgrade our directly owned store at the Hong Kong airport, currently the smallest in our airport network, to a full-sized duty-free store. With these 2 stores, we expect to be able to more efficiently target the Chinese traveler retail segment.
Third, we are setting up our digital relevance with the recent e-commerce enablement of our China company website. This is important for us to be able to inform and influence purchasing decisions of customers when they are deciding which brand and specific product to buy. Apart from the additional online sales opportunity, especially in third-tier Chinese cities where we don't have a physical presence, we expect these e-commerce efforts to increase traffic and conversion rate in our physical stores and increase the effectiveness of our digital marketing. We are also increasing our weight in the Chinese digital ecosystem with the addition of WeChat limited edition program we did for Chinese Valentine's Day in August and additional ones for the holidays and for Chinese New Year.
Fourth, we have 3 new marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2019. First, we plan to open Blue Box Cafés in both the new Hong Kong location at 1 Peking Road as well as the next Shanghai flagship at Hong Kong Plaza. This will be the first permanent Blue Box Cafés in Tiffany stores outside of New York. And just as in New York, we expect it will generate substantial customer retention and store traffic. Secondly, we will be conducting a series of consumer-facing Diamonds of Tiffany events across Greater China to educate consumers on our unparalleled cutting and polishing craftsmanship and to reinforce our diamond authority in this market. 
Last and perhaps most importantly, on September 23 in Shanghai, we will inaugurate Tiffany & Co. Vision & Virtuosity, the largest-ever Tiffany brand exhibition. The brand will celebrate its over 180-year history and heritage in a unique experiential setting. Instead of being just a retrospective, over 350 archival products, along with numerous other high jewelry pieces and exclusive previews from the 2019 Blue Book high jewelry collection, will be displayed in a more experiential thematic environment, which match the DNA of the Tiffany brand. We expect these initiatives to drastically increase the awareness and the depth of knowledge of our brand among the Chinese including, importantly, the millennial segment.
Now that we have provided additional insight on how our efforts are aligning across Greater China, let's shift back to the broader company for which we keep progressing on the road map that we shared with you about 18 months ago. Many of you have asked us about our excitement from the second half product newness, which will be taking place all across the world. While we don't want to take the surprise away from our customers, we can mention that we have already prelaunched a colorful new extension to our iconic Tiffany T collection. We have also already prelaunched in selected stores a reinvigorated men's lineup. And as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we are moving forward with an additional fragrance offering later this year. 
So while we acknowledge that we still have much to do before the full effect of the strategic investments we have made and continue to make across the business are fully implemented across all product categories and key markets, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, particularly in the areas where we have dedicated the most time and resources. 
Let me now turn the call over to Mark, so he can share a few additional thoughts before we open up the call to your questions."
35576,618378690,1813602,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2019",2019-08-28,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just",906,"Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just a few salient matters. 
First, gross margin in the second quarter was 130 basis points below year ago, just like it was during the first quarter. There was a little bit of negative sales leverage on fixed manufacturing and other costs, but our factory loads were better balanced as we built inventory to support our second half launches in anticipation of a stronger holiday season. So the real driver of lower gross margin in the quarter was a mix impact from a meaningful increase in high jewelry sales, which as you know is an area we've been focusing on this past year. 
And over the balance of the year, since our second half product launches should increase the sales mix for our gold and diamond jewelry collections relative to higher margin silver jewelry, we'd expect some additional pressure on gross margin. However, that should be more than offset by volume leverage as we expect to regain sales momentum and the absence of certain costs, such as the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner we recorded in the third quarter of last year. Looking even further out, we plan to invest even more behind our high jewelry offerings and have plans to continue introducing even more gold with and without diamonds and diamond products as part of our strategic efforts to put more emphasis on increasing our average unit selling price in the years ahead.
Importantly, our multiyear product and marketing plans call for moving a larger percentage of our overall sales mix to higher price points gradually by focusing on and growing gold and diamond jewelry collections and high jewelry at a faster pace than engagement and silver jewelry. That said, it is important to note we still have plans for both engagement and silver jewelry to grow going forward just at rates below those expected to be achieved in high jewelry and across our gold and diamond jewelry collections. It is for this reason that some of you might notice we reframed the product imagery on all of our e-commerce sites, along with the products featured in our digital and social campaigns recently to showcase gold and diamond jewelry collections more prominently. 
Second, SG&A expenses were well contained during the second quarter with total SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales dropping from 46.3% last year to 45.2% this year, a reduction of 110 basis points. Prudent cost management, particularly on the labor line as we seek to create organizational efficiencies and ongoing global procurement efforts, which achieved a notable milestone this past quarter with the implementation of our new source-to-pay solution in the United States, both contributed. We also took the decision to hold back some advertising dollars in the second quarter, so they could be more effectively deployed against our strong second half product introduction plans.
Finally, from a store network perspective and in addition to the Greater China stores Alex referenced earlier, we just announced the opening of 2 stores in India later this fiscal year and next year, 1 each in New Delhi and Mumbai through a joint venture with an India-based luxury retail leader. And we are continuing to make good progress on the New York flagship transformation. 
From a guidance standpoint, you may recall at the start of the year and again during our first quarter earnings release, we called for a soft first half followed by a rebound during the second half, which would result in full year reported sales growth of low single digits. And while our first and second quarter sales results were a couple points lower than we would have liked for reasons we have discussed, they have been, generally speaking, consistent with our overall expectations. 
As Alex mentioned earlier, tourism patterns are volatile and the situation in Hong Kong remains very fluid. In addition, the Japanese government has announced its intentions to increase its sales consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% in October of this year, which is adding even more unpredictability to an already challenging macroeconomic environment. This is because in the past, business has significantly accelerated in Japan prior to consumer sales tax increases of this magnitude and then decelerated in the months thereafter. But whether or not the same phenomenon will occur this time around is very hard to predict.
Against the backdrop of these uncertainties and after balancing our first half results against our strong second half marketing and product plans, we still expect to grow full year reported sales by low single digits. And relative to the bottom line, our guidance also remains unchanged at low to mid-single-digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Now that said, if, for example, the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong persists much longer at its current rate, we may find ourselves towards the lower end of our full year reported sales and EPS guidance range. And if the situation were to deteriorate even further or if the current level of unrest is maintained for the balance of the fiscal year, we may find ourselves below the bottom end of our ranges. 
So I'll now turn the call back to Jason and we can take your questions."

So this was -- didn't come as a surprise. And I think on the marketing, we have been acting very quickly and effectively. And we changed the communication and we keep on tweaking and changing and evolving every quarter. 
So to be honest with you, the longest time needed is, of course, in efficiencies and especially in the cultural shift, which are the 2 last priorities that we mentioned in our road map. And on efficiencies, we started seeing already some signs of managing cost more effectively in this quarter. But honestly, it's just the beginning because this is a process that will take years in order to really show a significant impact on profit. And the cultural change is something that is progressing well but is obviously the one that takes the most because it has to do with human beings and 14,000 people in the company. But I have to say it's -- I mean, there are no situations where I feel that we have a problem or where we stop. We keep on progressing on the road map we put together."

The point is that what is important is that to reach a critical mass of newness in order to really see results being steady growing because it's a process, it's a path, it's a journey. So I'm confident about the second part of this year because we will be in a much better position than we were 1 year ago. But I expect 1 year later to be in a much better position than we will be in the second half. So it's really a path with a steady growth."

The only thing I would offer on that is if you think about where we are fiscal year-to-date, reported sales are down 2.7%. Contained within that is about over -- slightly over 2 points of FX scrape, which we think is going to be based on current spot rates, largely a push. You might process 20, 30 basis points in the balance of the year, but it's not going to be nearly as consequential. If you think about the comps that we're going to be starting to dial up against, last year in Q1 and Q2, we both -- for both quarters, we posted plus 7s. That was a plus 3% in Q3 and it was flat basically in Q4. New stores is also going to be contributing a lot more in the second half than it did in the first half. 
You heard Alex talk about some very large stores that will be coming online. So that should be a contributor. Then of course, the biggest thing is just the product and the marketing and the holiday plans and everything else that we've been doing. So we feel good about where we sit right now based on the way we've laid out the year. As far as the question on price, promotional activity, you're right. We don't engage in any of those types of activities. And frankly, while we continue to do the scrapes, we haven't seen anybody out there doing things in our particular space that gives us, at this point, any cause for concern."

In total, for the full year, we have plans to spend in a dollarized basis, very similar levels of marketing funds in '19 as we spent versus '18. 
And you'll recall that from '17 to '18, we had a meaningful step-up in the amount of marketing dollars that we are investing behind the business. As far as the second quarter itself is specifically concerned, while certainly a little less in marketing versus year ago in the quarter, that in the prior period had the launch of PAPER FLOWERS, obviously it wasn't [indiscernible] [structural ] economics.

So about -- well, first of all, I would like to underline that the domestic sales to domestic customers on a global basis were positive once again, plus 2% versus plus 3% the previous quarter. And this for me is a very important point because it's the largest part of our sales and is where the brand is suited for future growth. Having said so, it's true that under 2 reasons, we have been suffering in the second quarter as well. I have to say that the decrease in sales to Chinese tourists on a global basis has been similar in the second quarter as well as in the first quarter. And the same would apply to non-Chinese tourists. Because also there, especially due to the strong dollar, there has been a decrease in sales to tourists. 
So it's something that was already there in the first quarter. And basically, it's been in the same order of magnitude also in the second quarter. Now as it refers to U.S. or North America consumers, we have experienced now since a few quarters quite softer trend. This quarter, the sales to -- domestic sales in the U.S. was slightly down. But I'm very confident that with all the marketing activities and the push we have in the second part of the year, if things remain the same, we will have a good performance because we are really focusing on the second part of the year."

So with respect to Hong Kong, it is our fourth largest market. It's critically important for us. We talked about the fact that we lost 6 store days during the second quarter. But that's just indicative of what's happening in that market today. Obviously right now, there's a lot of folks focused on various matters and shopping may not be their primary concern. For us, Hong Kong is a country or is a market that is mid-single digits of total sales. If that was to be down by 20%, hypothetically, that would take 1 point off of full year sales block. If it was down by 40% and it was mid-single digits, it would take off 2 full points for the year, just to give you some sense on it. 
As far as the gross margin question is concerned, we really talked about happening in the first quarter and the second quarter was very strong high jewelry sales, which has a lower gross margin associated with it. And we've talked about that in the past. As we think about the first half, second half inflection points on gross margin, one of the key things to note is that we believe we will restore our volume momentum and we'll get fixed cost leverage as a result of that going into the second half. We also believe that there's some onetime items, like the filing of a metal refiner that went into bankruptcy during the third quarter of last year and a few other items, some of which are related to obsolescence and a few other things that are coming to pass. We are confident that we can continue to expand our operating margin on a going-forward basis once we get to a sustainable plot of sales growth because of all the things that, that will do to the P&L as well as of our cost takeout initiatives.

And this is something, of course, that goes beyond our control. Because it has to do with exchange rates but also simply arrival of customers or tourists in different countries, et cetera. Now there are ways, of course, we have and we have put in place in order to try to address this. First of all is when there are less --  there is less spending abroad, to concentrate on the domestic market, so try to get to the consumers in the local market where they are. And in this, we have a strong position because we have a network that is truly global, and so we are capable to reach out to customers if they travel but also if they stay at home. 
The second kind of activity we are doing, and this was one of the examples I was making about China, is to be present selectively but in very important airport locations. Because, for example, the reason for having a store in the Beijing airport because Chinese tourists at that point can purchase at Beijing while they are flying out, regardless of the destination of the flight. Or the reason for enlarging the Hong Kong airport store is because Hong Kong is a crucial point where people, not only as a final destination but also the connecting flight and is a very nice shopping environment. So this is another activity we have -- we can do. 
And then the third we are doing -- and the third one is that of balancing our inventory. So for example, this is why I mentioned before during the prepared remarks, we have shifted high jewelry assortment to mainland China to stores in Shanghai and Beijing because as Chinese tourists tend to spend less abroad, then we have more availability of high jewelry products in the country in the way that we can partially offset the sales abroad. Now all of this is what is in our hands. Of course, all this can only partially offset the new sales abroad because it's normal that somebody -- when the tourist tends to spend more freely, more happily and -- but this is what we can do and we are doing it actively."

Europe, while it has been kind of flattish, we do believe that the product and marketing plans we have there will allow us to grow comparable store sales in constant currency in those regions. North America is probably the single largest opportunity for us. Last year, we had a relatively soft holiday. And with the programs we have in place this year, we really believe that we should be able to do a better job of connecting with the U.S. consumer. And given the size, that's clearly the largest opportunity for us. 
Japan, we've talked about Japan and the consumption tax change there. That's a little bit of a wildcard back. In 2014, when the consumption tax went from 5% to 8%, we saw a meaningful pull-forward of business in the 2-month period prior to the implementation of that tax increase and then it kind of fell away. So how that rates over the third and fourth quarters is a little bit of a wildcard for us. But generally speaking, we expect the regions to perform better in the second half than they did in the first for all the reasons we've cited."

And especially, you know that when you change completely your platform, especially also the wording, et cetera, it has an impact on the search engine optimization because of the algorithms of Google and other search engines that take a few months in order to come back to the normal efficiency. 
So all this to say that these 3 months have been a bit disruptive, quite disruptive, I should say, with a negative trend in our online sales. But we were expecting that and we are seeing an improvement and that this is the reason why we did all these changes during the summer in order to be ready for the second part of the year, which is when the most important season is also for online sales. Consider also that simultaneously, we have opened the China website as e-commerce has been another big effort. The start has been very positive, but it's just 1 month.

It's important to point out just how much movement there has been. If you go back to before July 1, 2018, and you look at the product types, whether it's silver or yellow gold, white gold or platinum or what have you, our all-in blended weighted average tariff was roughly 28%. Then in July of 2018 with the tariff cuts that went into effect, that dropped down to a high single-digit percentage. We dial back around in September, mid-September of '18, it went up to the mid-teens. And by June of this year, we were basically back to the mid-20s. With the current discussion taking place, what could be triggered in December would actually take us above where we were when this whole thing started. So instead of being at 28%, we could be in the low 30s potentially. So it's an area that we're watching very, very closely. Because of the way we shift products typically from the U.S., there is bit of a lag effect in when that tends to hit us. We don't expect a large additional impact if those December tariffs, which take effect this fiscal. 
That said, we have used some pricing in the past to help mitigate some of these areas. But as the pricing also would go in the opposite direction to follow the tariffs down, we've had to be very flexible and responsive in the marketplace. The biggest concern that we have frankly on a longer-term basis is the tariff differential between a company such as ourselves who manufactures most things in the U.S. versus some of the European competitors. And that's where, when we got together last quarter, we talked about the fact that we didn't feel it would be appropriate to take pricing actions and maybe do that unilaterally and get ourselves into an uncompetitive price situation. So we did have to eat that last round of tariffs. Whether or not we have to do something like that again, we'll have to make that determination over the next many weeks and months. But for now for the fiscal, I think we're in a reasonably good place. But longer term, it's an area that we obviously have a lot of concern about and are watching very closely."

Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved",1970,"Thanks, Jason, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved on the bottom line versus our internal forecast, which Mark will elaborate on during his prepared remarks. 
But first, let's spend some time putting our second quarter sales results in context. Global reported sales did drop by 3%, but this was against a backdrop that included last year's strong 12% increase, a significant decline in both sales attributed to Chinese and all other tourists and meaningful business disruption in Hong Kong. 
Let's take a few additional seconds on each of these. Last year, during the second quarter of 2018, we generated significant U.S. and global attention behind the holistic launch of PAPER FLOWERS in New York and our ""Believe in Dreams"" campaign, which we believe drove a meaningful increase in both traffic and sales. We expect similar excitement behind our main product activations this year. But those will take place during the later stages of the third and the early part of the fourth quarter.
Second quarter sales results were also impacted by a continued sharp decline in sales to both Chinese and all other tourists, which we believe lowered our reported sales by a couple percentage points. In Hong Kong, where we have 10 stores and which is our fourth biggest market relative to total sales only after the United States, Japan and mainland China, has been presented with a unique set of challenges. Obviously, we hope for a quick and peaceful resolution to the unrest being experienced there. But in the meantime, we must acknowledge that the current situation is taking a toll on our business. In fact, we estimate that during the second quarter, we lost nearly 6 full selling days due to unplanned store closures. 
Despite all of this, our internal estimates indicate that during the second quarter, we grew constant currency retail sales to local customers on a global basis by 2%, which we believe is a much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential and within which we once again posted strong double-digit growth with local customers in mainland China.  
Having provided some short-term commentary on the second quarter, let's now pivot to something much more important, our mid- and long-term efforts to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth rates consistent with our position as global luxury jeweler. We are now 6 quarters into the long and exciting journey we effectively began at the start of fiscal 2018, when we took the bold decision to meaningfully increase investment spending to support our 6 key focus areas. As we stated then and as we continue to believe now, those investments have been carefully designed to be self-enforcing and to work in concert with each other over time in order to ultimately allow us to consistently deliver sustainable top line sales growth. 
You have also heard us repeatedly state that we do not expect to deliver sustainable top line sales growth until we have been able to introduce a sufficient number of distinctive new products; amplify and evolve marketing message with sufficient impact as to attract a significant number of new customers; reactivate lapsed ones while continuing to delight our existing customers; upgrade key aspects of our physical store network while also adding experiential elements to our in-store environment, such as visual merchandising, jewelry styling bars, et cetera; and develop through enabling technologies a seamless omni-channel customer experience. 
We are making good progress on all of these fronts. However, as an illustration, since we believe there are inherent limits on the maximum amount of product newness we can be properly supported with 360-degree marketing and PR campaigns as well as robust in-store execution without becoming confusing or distracting for our customers, we estimate that it may take until fiscal 2021 to properly refresh our product assortment with enough newness to generate balanced and sustainable growth across our entire product portfolio.
We are committed to reinvigorating the business the right way as we aim for industry-leading levels of shareholder value creation, which we believe define long-term success. In the meantime, it may admittedly be a bit hard to see how the strategic investment decisions we have made so far are positively impacting the business, given timing shifts in new product launches as compared to last year, macroeconomic noise from lower tourism spending and the disruption taking place in Hong Kong. 
Therefore, we thought it might be helpful to spend a few minutes talking about how all of the decisions we have made over the past 18 months are working together in mainland China, a key strategic market, which from the beginning of this journey we have identified to receive a high level of management focus and investment. For example, mainland China is where we chose to disproportionately increase marketing spending and media penetration last year. It was also mainland China where we took the decision to stand up our retail foundation information technology platform first back in the first quarter of 2018. 
During the first half of 2019, we increased the high jewelry presence at our Beijing, China World store as well as in a number of additional major stores, such as Shanghai IFC and Beijing Shin Kong Place. Then during the second quarter of 2019, we sold through limited quantities of special Tiffany Keys diamond pendants on WeChat for 5/20 or I Love You Day, supported by Liu Haoran, a famous Chinese actor with nearly 30 million Weibo followers. And we enabled e-commerce on our tiffany.cn website for the first time. 
We believe that all of these actions plus improvements in the relevance of our message into Chinese consumers and the launch of PAPER FLOWERS last fall have enabled us to significantly improve our brand power scores as surveyed by a third party in mainland China across critical consumer segments, such as self-purchasing women, high spenders and gifters. This, in turn, allowed us to improve our overall brand power ranking in China from fourth to second place during the past year. And even more importantly, we believe these actions plus others have allowed us to dramatically improve our business among domestic Chinese consumers. For perspective, constant currency comparable sales during the first half of 2019 grew 4 times faster than the first half of 2018 and second quarter 2019 sales grew more than 25%.  
In order to maintain this momentum, we have a number of real exciting and strategically important initiatives. Some have already begun and others will take place in the second half of the year across Greater China, all of which are designed to continue to broaden our appeal among Chinese consumers. Such initiatives can be grouped in 4 key strategies. 
First, we are strengthening our store network by opening or upgrading our flagship stores in 3 key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In Beijing, the relocation and upgrade of our flagship store in China World took place in Q1. In the next 2 quarters, we expect to have 2 major flagship launches in Hong Kong and Shanghai, respectively. In Hong Kong, we plan to open a 3-floor, street-facing flagship store at 1 Peking Road in the most popular shopping area in Hong Kong among Chinese tourists, which we expect to help close the gap with other major luxury brands, which have prominent stores in that area. In Shanghai, we plan to relocate and enlarge our store to arguably the most prominent corner location in the city at Hong Kong Plaza, an area of Shanghai where other prestigious luxury brands have significant street frontage presence. With our 3 flagship stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, we expect customers to be able to more fully experience the refinement, assortment, service and ultimately the power of the Tiffany & Co. brand.
Second, we are in the process of expanding our airport duty-free store network. In Q3, we plan to open the first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing airport with a partner. Next month, we plan to relocate and upgrade our directly owned store at the Hong Kong airport, currently the smallest in our airport network, to a full-sized duty-free store. With these 2 stores, we expect to be able to more efficiently target the Chinese traveler retail segment.
Third, we are setting up our digital relevance with the recent e-commerce enablement of our China company website. This is important for us to be able to inform and influence purchasing decisions of customers when they are deciding which brand and specific product to buy. Apart from the additional online sales opportunity, especially in third-tier Chinese cities where we don't have a physical presence, we expect these e-commerce efforts to increase traffic and conversion rate in our physical stores and increase the effectiveness of our digital marketing. We are also increasing our weight in the Chinese digital ecosystem with the addition of WeChat limited edition program we did for Chinese Valentine's Day in August and additional ones for the holidays and for Chinese New Year.
Fourth, we have 3 new marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2019. First, we plan to open Blue Box Cafés in both the new Hong Kong location at 1 Peking Road as well as the next Shanghai flagship at Hong Kong Plaza. This will be the first permanent Blue Box Cafés in Tiffany stores outside of New York. And just as in New York, we expect it will generate substantial customer retention and store traffic. Secondly, we will be conducting a series of consumer-facing Diamonds of Tiffany events across Greater China to educate consumers on our unparalleled cutting and polishing craftsmanship and to reinforce our diamond authority in this market. 
Last and perhaps most importantly, on September 23 in Shanghai, we will inaugurate Tiffany & Co. Vision & Virtuosity, the largest-ever Tiffany brand exhibition. The brand will celebrate its over 180-year history and heritage in a unique experiential setting. Instead of being just a retrospective, over 350 archival products, along with numerous other high jewelry pieces and exclusive previews from the 2019 Blue Book high jewelry collection, will be displayed in a more experiential thematic environment, which match the DNA of the Tiffany brand. We expect these initiatives to drastically increase the awareness and the depth of knowledge of our brand among the Chinese including, importantly, the millennial segment.
Now that we have provided additional insight on how our efforts are aligning across Greater China, let's shift back to the broader company for which we keep progressing on the road map that we shared with you about 18 months ago. Many of you have asked us about our excitement from the second half product newness, which will be taking place all across the world. While we don't want to take the surprise away from our customers, we can mention that we have already prelaunched a colorful new extension to our iconic Tiffany T collection. We have also already prelaunched in selected stores a reinvigorated men's lineup. And as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we are moving forward with an additional fragrance offering later this year. 
So while we acknowledge that we still have much to do before the full effect of the strategic investments we have made and continue to make across the business are fully implemented across all product categories and key markets, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, particularly in the areas where we have dedicated the most time and resources. 
Let me now turn the call over to Mark, so he can share a few additional thoughts before we open up the call to your questions."
35576,618378690,1813643,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2019",2019-08-28,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just",906,"Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just a few salient matters. 
First, gross margin in the second quarter was 130 basis points below year ago, just like it was during the first quarter. There was a little bit of negative sales leverage on fixed manufacturing and other costs, but our factory loads were better balanced as we built inventory to support our second half launches in anticipation of a stronger holiday season. So the real driver of lower gross margin in the quarter was a mix impact from a meaningful increase in high jewelry sales, which as you know is an area we've been focusing on this past year. 
And over the balance of the year, since our second half product launches should increase the sales mix for our gold and diamond jewelry collections relative to higher margin silver jewelry, we'd expect some additional pressure on gross margin. However, that should be more than offset by volume leverage as we expect to regain sales momentum and the absence of certain costs, such as the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner we recorded in the third quarter of last year. Looking even further out, we plan to invest even more behind our high jewelry offerings and have plans to continue introducing even more gold with and without diamonds and diamond products as part of our strategic efforts to put more emphasis on increasing our average unit selling price in the years ahead.
Importantly, our multiyear product and marketing plans call for moving a larger percentage of our overall sales mix to higher price points gradually by focusing on and growing gold and diamond jewelry collections and high jewelry at a faster pace than engagement and silver jewelry. That said, it is important to note we still have plans for both engagement and silver jewelry to grow going forward just at rates below those expected to be achieved in high jewelry and across our gold and diamond jewelry collections. It is for this reason that some of you might notice we reframed the product imagery on all of our e-commerce sites, along with the products featured in our digital and social campaigns recently to showcase gold and diamond jewelry collections more prominently. 
Second, SG&A expenses were well contained during the second quarter with total SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales dropping from 46.3% last year to 45.2% this year, a reduction of 110 basis points. Prudent cost management, particularly on the labor line as we seek to create organizational efficiencies and ongoing global procurement efforts, which achieved a notable milestone this past quarter with the implementation of our new source-to-pay solution in the United States, both contributed. We also took the decision to hold back some advertising dollars in the second quarter, so they could be more effectively deployed against our strong second half product introduction plans.
Finally, from a store network perspective and in addition to the Greater China stores Alex referenced earlier, we just announced the opening of 2 stores in India later this fiscal year and next year, 1 each in New Delhi and Mumbai through a joint venture with an India-based luxury retail leader. And we are continuing to make good progress on the New York flagship transformation. 
From a guidance standpoint, you may recall at the start of the year and again during our first quarter earnings release, we called for a soft first half followed by a rebound during the second half, which would result in full year reported sales growth of low single digits. And while our first and second quarter sales results were a couple points lower than we would have liked for reasons we have discussed, they have been, generally speaking, consistent with our overall expectations. 
As Alex mentioned earlier, tourism patterns are volatile and the situation in Hong Kong remains very fluid. In addition, the Japanese government has announced its intentions to increase its sales consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% in October of this year, which is adding even more unpredictability to an already challenging macroeconomic environment. This is because in the past, business has significantly accelerated in Japan prior to consumer sales tax increases of this magnitude and then decelerated in the months thereafter. But whether or not the same phenomenon will occur this time around is very hard to predict.
Against the backdrop of these uncertainties and after balancing our first half results against our strong second half marketing and product plans, we still expect to grow full year reported sales by low single digits. And relative to the bottom line, our guidance also remains unchanged at low to mid-single-digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Now that said, if, for example, the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong persists much longer at its current rate, we may find ourselves towards the lower end of our full year reported sales and EPS guidance range. And if the situation were to deteriorate even further or if the current level of unrest is maintained for the balance of the fiscal year, we may find ourselves below the bottom end of our ranges. 
So I'll now turn the call back to Jason and we can take your questions."

Thank you, Oliver. As for the gold versus silver evolution, silver, although it's the smallest part of our business in terms of metal, where the order is the largest portion is platinum, the second is, by far, gold and silver is the smaller one, it's an important segment for us and is a segment in which we believe is part of our heritage of our portfolio. And we have plans to grow it going further as any other segment. It's true that in this particular moment, we are experiencing a stronger momentum, more in the gold rather than in the silver.

So this was -- didn't come as a surprise. And I think on the marketing, we have been acting very quickly and effectively. And we changed the communication and we keep on tweaking and changing and evolving every quarter. 
So to be honest with you, the longest time needed is, of course, in efficiencies and especially in the cultural shift, which are the 2 last priorities that we mentioned in our road map. And on efficiencies, we started seeing already some signs of managing cost more effectively in this quarter. But honestly, it's just the beginning because this is a process that will take years in order to really show a significant impact on profit. And the cultural change is something that is progressing well but is obviously the one that takes the most because it has to do with human beings and 14,000 people in the company.

And this for me is a very important point because it's the largest part of our sales and is where the brand is suited for future growth. Having said so, it's true that under 2 reasons, we have been suffering in the second quarter as well. I have to say that the decrease in sales to Chinese tourists on a global basis has been similar in the second quarter as well as in the first quarter. And the same would apply to non-Chinese tourists. Because also there, especially due to the strong dollar, there has been a decrease in sales to tourists. 
So it's something that was already there in the first quarter. And basically, it's been in the same order of magnitude also in the second quarter. Now as it refers to U.S. or North America consumers, we have experienced now since a few quarters quite softer trend. This quarter, the sales to -- domestic sales in the U.S. was slightly down.

So with respect to Hong Kong, it is our fourth largest market. It's critically important for us. We talked about the fact that we lost 6 store days during the second quarter. But that's just indicative of what's happening in that market today. Obviously right now, there's a lot of folks focused on various matters and shopping may not be their primary concern. For us, Hong Kong is a country or is a market that is mid-single digits of total sales. If that was to be down by 20%, hypothetically, that would take 1 point off of full year sales block. If it was down by 40% and it was mid-single digits, it would take off 2 full points for the year, just to give you some sense on it. 
As far as the gross margin question is concerned, we really talked about happening in the first quarter and the second quarter was very strong high jewelry sales, which has a lower gross margin associated with it. And we've talked about that in the past. As we think about the first half, second half inflection points on gross margin, one of the key things to note is that we believe we will restore our volume momentum and we'll get fixed cost leverage as a result of that going into the second half. We also believe that there's some onetime items, like the filing of a metal refiner that went into bankruptcy during the third quarter of last year and a few other items, some of which are related to obsolescence and a few other things that are coming to pass.

So the answer is yes, there will be global launches worldwide in the second part of the year. 
As for the kind of products, let me say there is a good range of price points. Main focus is actually on gold, plain and with diamond. But there are also newness in more entry price, both in gold as well as silver as well, of course, in the fine jewelry, $20,000 up to, I would say, $80,000 that will be introduced.

And this is something, of course, that goes beyond our control. Because it has to do with exchange rates but also simply arrival of customers or tourists in different countries, et cetera. Now there are ways, of course, we have and we have put in place in order to try to address this. First of all is when there are less --  there is less spending abroad, to concentrate on the domestic market, so try to get to the consumers in the local market where they are. And in this, we have a strong position because we have a network that is truly global, and so we are capable to reach out to customers if they travel but also if they stay at home. 
The second kind of activity we are doing, and this was one of the examples I was making about China, is to be present selectively but in very important airport locations. Because, for example, the reason for having a store in the Beijing airport because Chinese tourists at that point can purchase at Beijing while they are flying out, regardless of the destination of the flight. Or the reason for enlarging the Hong Kong airport store is because Hong Kong is a crucial point where people, not only as a final destination but also the connecting flight and is a very nice shopping environment. So this is another activity we have -- we can do. 
And then the third we are doing -- and the third one is that of balancing our inventory. So for example, this is why I mentioned before during the prepared remarks, we have shifted high jewelry assortment to mainland China to stores in Shanghai and Beijing because as Chinese tourists tend to spend less abroad, then we have more availability of high jewelry products in the country in the way that we can partially offset the sales abroad. Now all of this is what is in our hands. Of course, all this can only partially offset the new sales abroad because it's normal that somebody -- when the tourist tends to spend more freely, more happily and -- but this is what we can do and we are doing it actively."

Europe, while it has been kind of flattish, we do believe that the product and marketing plans we have there will allow us to grow comparable store sales in constant currency in those regions. North America is probably the single largest opportunity for us. Last year, we had a relatively soft holiday. And with the programs we have in place this year, we really believe that we should be able to do a better job of connecting with the U.S. consumer. And given the size, that's clearly the largest opportunity for us. 
Japan, we've talked about Japan and the consumption tax change there. That's a little bit of a wildcard back. In 2014, when the consumption tax went from 5% to 8%, we saw a meaningful pull-forward of business in the 2-month period prior to the implementation of that tax increase and then it kind of fell away. So how that rates over the third and fourth quarters is a little bit of a wildcard for us.

So all this to say that these 3 months have been a bit disruptive, quite disruptive, I should say, with a negative trend in our online sales. But we were expecting that and we are seeing an improvement and that this is the reason why we did all these changes during the summer in order to be ready for the second part of the year, which is when the most important season is also for online sales.

It's important to point out just how much movement there has been. If you go back to before July 1, 2018, and you look at the product types, whether it's silver or yellow gold, white gold or platinum or what have you, our all-in blended weighted average tariff was roughly 28%. Then in July of 2018 with the tariff cuts that went into effect, that dropped down to a high single-digit percentage. We dial back around in September, mid-September of '18, it went up to the mid-teens. And by June of this year, we were basically back to the mid-20s. With the current discussion taking place, what could be triggered in December would actually take us above where we were when this whole thing started. So instead of being at 28%, we could be in the low 30s potentially. So it's an area that we're watching very, very closely. Because of the way we shift products typically from the U.S., there is bit of a lag effect in when that tends to hit us. We don't expect a large additional impact if those December tariffs, which take effect this fiscal. 
That said, we have used some pricing in the past to help mitigate some of these areas. But as the pricing also would go in the opposite direction to follow the tariffs down, we've had to be very flexible and responsive in the marketplace. The biggest concern that we have frankly on a longer-term basis is the tariff differential between a company such as ourselves who manufactures most things in the U.S. versus some of the European competitors. And that's where, when we got together last quarter, we talked about the fact that we didn't feel it would be appropriate to take pricing actions and maybe do that unilaterally and get ourselves into an uncompetitive price situation. So we did have to eat that last round of tariffs. Whether or not we have to do something like that again, we'll have to make that determination over the next many weeks and months. But for now for the fiscal, I think we're in a reasonably good place. But longer term, it's an area that we obviously have a lot of concern about and are watching very closely."

Let me start by saying right up front that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieve",1971,"Thanks, Jason, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by saying right up front that our second quarter results were mixed. The top line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations. But we are encouraged by the slight overdeliver we achieved on the bottom line versus our internal forecast, which Mark will elaborate on during his prepared remarks. 
But first, let's spend some time putting our second quarter sales results in context. Global reported sales did drop by 3%, but this was against a backdrop that included last year's strong 12% increase, a significant decline in both sales attributed to Chinese and all other tourists and meaningful business disruption in Hong Kong. 
Let's take a few additional seconds on each of these. Last year, during the second quarter of 2018, we generated significant U.S. and global attention behind the holistic launch of PAPER FLOWERS in New York and our ""Believe in Dreams"" campaign, which we believe drove a meaningful increase in both traffic and sales. We expect similar excitement behind our main product activations this year. But those will take place during the later stages of the third and the early part of the fourth quarter.
Second quarter sales results were also impacted by a continued sharp decline in sales to both Chinese and all other tourists, which we believe lowered our reported sales by a couple percentage points. In Hong Kong, where we have 10 stores and which is our fourth biggest market relative to total sales only after the United States, Japan and mainland China, has been presented with a unique set of challenges. Obviously, we hope for a quick and peaceful resolution to the unrest being experienced there. But in the meantime, we must acknowledge that the current situation is taking a toll on our business. In fact, we estimate that during the second quarter, we lost nearly 6 full selling days due to unplanned store closures. 
Despite all of this, our internal estimates indicate that during the second quarter, we grew constant currency retail sales to local customers on a global basis by 2%, which we believe is a much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential and within which we once again posted strong double-digit growth with local customers in mainland China. 
Having provided some short-term commentary on the second quarter, let's now pivot to something much more important, our mid- and long-term efforts to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth rates consistent with our position as global luxury jeweler. We are now 6 quarters into the long and exciting journey we effectively began at the start of fiscal 2018, when we took the bold decision to meaningfully increase investment spending to support our 6 key focus areas. As we stated then and as we continue to believe now, those investments have been carefully designed to be self-enforcing and to work in concert with each other over time in order to ultimately allow us to consistently deliver sustainable top line sales growth. 
You have also heard us repeatedly state that we do not expect to deliver sustainable top line sales growth until we have been able to introduce a sufficient number of distinctive new products; amplify and evolve marketing message with sufficient impact as to attract a significant number of new customers; reactivate lapsed ones while continuing to delight our existing customers; upgrade key aspects of our physical store network while also adding experiential elements to our in-store environment, such as visual merchandising, jewelry styling bars, et cetera; and develop through enabling technologies a seamless omnichannel customer experience. 
We are making good progress on all of these fronts. However, as an illustration, since we believe there are inherent limits on the maximum amount of product newness we can be properly supported with 360-degree marketing and PR campaigns as well as robust in-store execution without becoming confusing or distracting for our customers, we estimate that it may take until fiscal 2021 to properly refresh our product assortment with enough newness to generate balanced and sustainable growth across our entire product portfolio.
We are committed to reinvigorating the business the right way as we aim for industry-leading levels of shareholder value creation, which we believe define long-term success. In the meantime, it may admittedly be a bit hard to see how the strategic investment decisions we have made so far are positively impacting the business, given timing shifts in new product launches as compared to last year, macroeconomic noise from lower tourism spending and the disruption taking place in Hong Kong. 
Therefore, we thought it might be helpful to spend a few minutes talking about how all of the decisions we have made over the past 18 months are working together in mainland China, a key strategic market, which from the beginning of this journey we have identified to receive a high level of management focus and investment. For example, mainland China is where we chose to disproportionately increase marketing spending and media penetration last year. It was also mainland China where we took the decision to stand up our retail foundation information technology platform first back in the first quarter of 2018. 
During the first half of 2019, we increased the high jewelry presence at our Beijing, China World store as well as in a number of additional major stores, such as Shanghai IFC and Beijing Shin Kong Place. Then during the second quarter of 2019, we sold through limited quantities of special Tiffany Keys diamond pendants on WeChat for 5/20 or I Love You Day, supported by Liu Haoran, a famous Chinese actor with nearly 30 million Weibo followers. And we enabled e-commerce on our tiffany.cn website for the first time. 
We believe that all of these actions plus improvements in the relevance of our message into Chinese consumers and the launch of PAPER FLOWERS last fall have enabled us to significantly improve our brand power scores as surveyed by a third party in mainland China across critical consumer segments, such as self-purchasing women, high spenders and gifters. This, in turn, allowed us to improve our overall brand power ranking in China from fourth to second place during the past year. And even more importantly, we believe these actions plus others have allowed us to dramatically improve our business among domestic Chinese consumers. For perspective, constant currency comparable sales during the first half of 2019 grew 4 times faster than the first half of 2018 and second quarter 2019 sales grew more than 25%. 
In order to maintain this momentum, we have a number of real exciting and strategically important initiatives. Some have already begun and others will take place in the second half of the year across Greater China, all of which are designed to continue to broaden our appeal among Chinese consumers. Such initiatives can be grouped in 4 key strategies. 
First, we are strengthening our store network by opening or upgrading our flagship stores in 3 key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In Beijing, the relocation and upgrade of our flagship store in China World took place in Q1. In the next 2 quarters, we expect to have 2 major flagship launches in Hong Kong and Shanghai, respectively. In Hong Kong, we plan to open a 3-floor, street-facing flagship store at 1 Peking Road in the most popular shopping area in Hong Kong among Chinese tourists, which we expect to help close the gap with other major luxury brands, which have prominent stores in that area. In Shanghai, we plan to relocate and enlarge our store to arguably the most prominent corner location in the city at Hong Kong Plaza, an area of Shanghai where other prestigious luxury brands have significant street frontage presence. With our 3 flagship stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, we expect customers to be able to more fully experience the refinement, assortment, service and ultimately the power of the Tiffany & Co. brand.
Second, we are in the process of expanding our airport duty-free store network. In Q3, we plan to open the first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing airport with a partner. Next month, we plan to relocate and upgrade our directly owned store at the Hong Kong airport, currently the smallest in our airport network, to a full-sized duty-free store. With these 2 stores, we expect to be able to more efficiently target the Chinese traveler retail segment.
Third, we are setting up our digital relevance with the recent e-commerce enablement of our China company website. This is important for us to be able to inform and influence purchasing decisions of customers when they are deciding which brand and specific product to buy. Apart from the additional online sales opportunity, especially in third-tier Chinese cities where we don't have a physical presence, we expect these e-commerce efforts to increase traffic and conversion rate in our physical stores and increase the effectiveness of our digital marketing. We are also increasing our weight in the Chinese digital ecosystem with the addition of WeChat limited edition program we did for Chinese Valentine's Day in August and additional ones for the holidays and for Chinese New Year.
Fourth, we have 3 new marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2019. First, we plan to open Blue Box Cafés in both the new Hong Kong location at 1 Peking Road as well as the next Shanghai flagship at Hong Kong Plaza. This will be the first permanent Blue Box Cafés in Tiffany stores outside of New York. And just as in New York, we expect it will generate substantial customer retention and store traffic. Secondly, we will be conducting a series of consumer-facing Diamonds of Tiffany events across Greater China to educate consumers on our unparalleled cutting and polishing craftsmanship and to reinforce our diamond authority in this market. 
Last and perhaps most importantly, on September 23 in Shanghai, we will inaugurate Tiffany & Co. Vision & Virtuosity, the largest-ever Tiffany brand exhibition. The brand will celebrate its over 180-year history and heritage in a unique experiential setting. Instead of being just a retrospective, over 350 archival products, along with numerous other high jewelry pieces and exclusive previews from the 2019 Blue Book high jewelry collection, will be displayed in a more experiential thematic environment, which match the DNA of the Tiffany brand. We expect these initiatives to drastically increase the awareness and the depth of knowledge of our brand among the Chinese including, importantly, the millennial segment.
Now that we have provided additional insight on how our efforts are aligning across Greater China, let's shift back to the broader company for which we keep progressing on the road map that we shared with you about 18 months ago. Many of you have asked us about our excitement from the second half product newness, which will be taking place all across the world. While we don't want to take the surprise away from our customers, we can mention that we have already prelaunched a colorful new extension to our iconic Tiffany T collection. We have also already prelaunched in selected stores a reinvigorated men's lineup. And as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we are moving forward with an additional fragrance offering later this year. 
So while we acknowledge that we still have much to do before the full effect of the strategic investments we have made and continue to make across the business are fully implemented across all product categories and key markets, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, particularly in the areas where we have dedicated the most time and resources. 
Let me now turn the call over to Mark, so he can share a few additional thoughts before we open up the call to your questions."
35576,618378690,1814465,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 28, 2019",2019-08-28,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just",906,"Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just a few salient matters. 
First, gross margin in the second quarter was 130 basis points below year ago, just like it was during the first quarter. There was a little bit of negative sales leverage on fixed manufacturing and other costs, but our factory loads were better balanced as we built inventory to support our second half launches in anticipation of a stronger holiday season. So the real driver of lower gross margin in the quarter was a mix impact from a meaningful increase in high jewelry sales, which as you know is an area we've been focusing on this past year. 
And over the balance of the year, since our second half product launches should increase the sales mix for our gold and diamond jewelry collections relative to higher margin silver jewelry, we'd expect some additional pressure on gross margin. However, that should be more than offset by volume leverage as we expect to regain sales momentum and the absence of certain costs, such as the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner we recorded in the third quarter of last year. Looking even further out, we plan to invest even more behind our high jewelry offerings and have plans to continue introducing even more gold with and without diamonds and diamond products as part of our strategic efforts to put more emphasis on increasing our average unit selling price in the years ahead.
Importantly, our multiyear product and marketing plans call for moving a larger percentage of our overall sales mix to higher price points gradually by focusing on and growing gold and diamond jewelry collections and high jewelry at a faster pace than engagement and silver jewelry. That said, it is important to note we still have plans for both engagement and silver jewelry to grow going forward just at rates below those expected to be achieved in high jewelry and across our gold and diamond jewelry collections. It is for this reason that some of you might notice we reframed the product imagery on all of our e-commerce sites, along with the products featured in our digital and social campaigns recently to showcase gold and diamond jewelry collections more prominently. 
Second, SG&A expenses were well contained during the second quarter with total SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales dropping from 46.3% last year to 45.2% this year, a reduction of 110 basis points. Prudent cost management, particularly on the labor line as we seek to create organizational efficiencies and ongoing global procurement efforts, which achieved a notable milestone this past quarter with the implementation of our new source-to-pay solution in the United States, both contributed. We also took the decision to hold back some advertising dollars in the second quarter, so they could be more effectively deployed against our strong second half product introduction plans.
Finally, from a store network perspective and in addition to the Greater China stores Alex referenced earlier, we just announced the opening of 2 stores in India later this fiscal year and next year, 1 each in New Delhi and Mumbai through a joint venture with an India-based luxury retail leader. And we are continuing to make good progress on the New York flagship transformation. 
From a guidance standpoint, you may recall at the start of the year and again during our first quarter earnings release, we called for a soft first half followed by a rebound during the second half, which would result in full year reported sales growth of low single digits. And while our first and second quarter sales results were a couple points lower than we would have liked for reasons we have discussed, they have been, generally speaking, consistent with our overall expectations. 
As Alex mentioned earlier, tourism patterns are volatile and the situation in Hong Kong remains very fluid. In addition, the Japanese government has announced its intentions to increase its sales consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% in October of this year, which is adding even more unpredictability to an already challenging macroeconomic environment. This is because in the past, business has significantly accelerated in Japan prior to consumer sales tax increases of this magnitude and then decelerated in the months thereafter. But whether or not the same phenomenon will occur this time around is very hard to predict.
Against the backdrop of these uncertainties and after balancing our first half results against our strong second half marketing and product plans, we still expect to grow full year reported sales by low single digits. And relative to the bottom line, our guidance also remains unchanged at low to mid-single-digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Now that said, if, for example, the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong persists much longer at its current rate, we may find ourselves towards the lower end of our full year reported sales and EPS guidance range. And if the situation were to deteriorate even further or if the current level of unrest is maintained for the balance of the fiscal year, we may find ourselves below the bottom end of our ranges. 
So I'll now turn the call back to Jason and we can take your questions."

This is why you will remember that already in the -- when we announced the first quarter results last year, we were very clear mentioning a long and exciting journey because it was clear to me that to revamp a product assortment on a brand like Tiffany is a multiyear progress -- process. So this was -- didn't come as a surprise. And I think on the marketing, we have been acting very quickly and effectively. And we changed the communication and we keep on tweaking and changing and evolving every quarter. 
So to be honest with you, the longest time needed is, of course, in efficiencies and especially in the cultural shift, which are the 2 last priorities that we mentioned in our road map. And on efficiencies, we started seeing already some signs of managing cost more effectively in this quarter. But honestly, it's just the beginning because this is a process that will take years in order to really show a significant impact on profit. And the cultural change is something that is progressing well but is obviously the one that takes the most because it has to do with human beings and 14,000 people in the company. But I have to say it's -- I mean there are no situations where I feel that we have a problem or where we stop. We keep on progressing on the road map we put together."

So I'm confident about the second part of this year because we will be in a much better position than we were 1 year ago.

So about -- well, first of all, I would like to underline that the domestic sales to domestic customers on a global basis were positive once again, plus 2% versus plus 3% the previous quarter. And this for me is a very important point because it's the largest part of our sales and is where the brand is suited for future growth. Having said so it's true that under 2 reasons, we have been suffering in the second quarter as well. I have to say that the decrease in sales to Chinese tourists on a global basis has been similar in the second quarter as well as in the first quarter. And the same would apply to non-Chinese tourists. Because also there, especially due to the strong dollar, there has been a decrease in sales to tourists. 
So it's something that was already there in the first quarter. And basically, it's been in the same order of magnitude also in the second quarter. Now as it refers to U.S. or North America consumers, we have experienced now since a few quarters quite softer trend. This quarter, the sales to -- domestic sales in the U.S. was slightly down. But I'm very confident that with all the marketing activities and the push we have in the second part of the year, if things remain the same, we will have a good performance because we are really focusing on the second part of the year."

So with respect to Hong Kong, it is our fourth largest market. It's critically important for us. We talked about the fact that we lost 6 store days during the second quarter. But that's just indicative of what's happening in that market today. Obviously right now, there's a lot of folks focused on various matters and shopping may not be their primary concern. For us, Hong Kong is a country or is a market that is mid-single digits of total sales. If that was to be down by 20%, hypothetically, that would take 1 point off of full year sales block. If it was down by 40% and it was mid-single digits, it would take off 2 full points for the year, just to give you some sense on it. 
As far as the gross margin question is concerned, we really talked about happening in the first quarter and the second quarter was very strong high jewelry sales, which has a lower gross margin associated with it. And we've talked about that in the past. As we think about the first half, second half inflection points on gross margin, one of the key things to note is that we believe we will restore our volume momentum and we'll get fixed cost leverage as a result of that going into the second half. We also believe that there's some onetime items, like the filing of a metal refiner that went into bankruptcy during the third quarter of last year and a few other items, some of which are related to obsolescence and a few other things that are coming to pass. We are confident that we can continue to expand our operating margin on a going-forward basis once we get to a sustainable plot of sales growth because of all the things that, that will do to the P&L as well as of our cost takeout initiatives.

As for the kind of products, let me say there is a good range of price points. Main focus is actually on gold, plain and with diamond.

And this is something, of course, that goes beyond our control. Because it has to do with exchange rates but also simply arrival of customers or tourists in different countries, et cetera. Now there are ways, of course, we have and we have put in place in order to try to address this. First of all is when there are less -- there is less spending abroad, to concentrate on the domestic market, so try to get to the consumers in the local market where they are. And in this, we have a strong position because we have a network that is truly global, and so we are capable to reach out to customers if they travel but also if they stay at home. 
The second kind of activity we are doing, and this was one of the examples I was making about China, is to be present selectively but in very important airport locations. Because, for example, the reason for having a store in the Beijing airport because Chinese tourists at that point can purchase at Beijing while they are flying out, regardless of the destination of the flight. Or the reason for enlarging the Hong Kong airport store is because Hong Kong is a crucial point where people, not only as a final destination but also the connecting flight and is a very nice shopping environment. So this is another activity we have -- we can do. 
And then the third we are doing -- and the third one is that of balancing our inventory. So for example, this is why I mentioned before during the prepared remarks, we have shifted high jewelry assortment to mainland China to stores in Shanghai and Beijing because as Chinese tourists tend to spend less abroad, then we have more availability of high jewelry products in the country in the way that we can partially offset the sales abroad. Now all of this is what is in our hands. Of course, all this can only partially offset the new sales abroad because it's normal that somebody -- when the tourist tends to spend more freely, more happily and -- but this is what we can do and we are doing it actively."

Europe, while it has been kind of flattish, we do believe that the product and marketing plans we have there will allow us to grow comparable store sales in constant currency in those regions. North America is probably the single largest opportunity for us. Last year, we had a relatively soft holiday. And with the programs we have in place this year, we really believe that we should be able to do a better job of connecting with the U.S. consumer. And given the size, that's clearly the largest opportunity for us. 
Japan, we've talked about Japan and the consumption tax change there. That's a little bit of a wildcard back. In 2014, when the consumption tax went from 5% to 8%, we saw a meaningful pull-forward of business in the 2-month period prior to the implementation of that tax increase and then it kind of fell away. So how that rates over the third and fourth quarters is a little bit of a wildcard for us.

It's important to point out just how much movement there has been. If you go back to before July 1, 2018, and you look at the product types, whether it's silver or yellow gold, white gold or platinum or what have you, our all-in blended weighted average tariff was roughly 28%. Then in July of 2018 with the tariff cuts that went into effect, that dropped down to a high single-digit percentage. We dial back around in September, mid-September of '18, it went up to the mid-teens. And by June of this year, we were basically back to the mid-20s. With the current discussion taking place, what could be triggered in December would actually take us above where we were when this whole thing started. So instead of being at 28%, we could be in the low 30s potentially. So it's an area that we're watching very, very closely. Because of the way we shift products typically from the U.S., there is bit of a lag effect in when that tends to hit us. We don't expect a large additional impact if those December tariffs, which take effect this fiscal. 
That said, we have used some pricing in the past to help mitigate some of these areas. But as the pricing also would go in the opposite direction to follow the tariffs down, we've had to be very flexible and responsive in the marketplace. The biggest concern that we have frankly on a longer-term basis is the tariff differential between a company such as ourselves who manufactures most things in the U.S. versus some of the European competitors. And that's where, when we got together last quarter, we talked about the fact that we didn't feel it would be appropriate to take pricing actions and maybe do that unilaterally and get ourselves into an uncompetitive price situation. So we did have to eat that last round of tariffs. Whether or not we have to do something like that again, we'll have to make that determination over the next many weeks and months. But for now for the fiscal, I think we're in a reasonably good place. But longer term, it's an area that we obviously have a lot of concern about and are watching very closely."
