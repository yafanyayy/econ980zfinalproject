We are pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for 2018, delivering 10% year-over-year revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
While the overall macro environment remain mixed, we remain confident in the technology trends, including AI, machine learning, cloud data center and 5G, that continue to drive strong design activity.
Our System Design Enablement strategy is to continue growing our core EDA and IP business; broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and importantly, expand into newer adjacent areas. I'm delighted to report that we have continued to make significant progress in all these areas. 
We achieved strong growth across our product lines in our core business, reaching product breakthrough while wide ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company.
In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Samsung through their broader adoption of our digital custom and verification products. We expanded our long-term partnership with Analog Devices for the development of mixed-signal solutions for IoT, automotive, medical and industrial applications, including the adoption of several of our new digital and verification products.
We made good progress in vertical segments such as the data center cloud, automotive, and particularly, in aerospace and defense. We have won business with some of the top companies in this space, including GE Aviations and BAE Systems. And we'll finish the year with major core EDA and IP contract with a major aerospace and defense contractor.
Earlier in the year, we won a significant research contract with DARPA, and have made very good progress, developing advanced machine learning technologies to enhance automations and productivity.
And as we look at expanding beyond EDA, I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with the Green Hills Software. Cadence invested about $150 million in Green Hills, representing our ownership interest of approximately 16%.
Our investment is important because safety and security are some of the greatest concerns in the increasingly hyper-connected world, especially in the critical industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive and medical.
Green Hills is the leading player in the embedded safety and security software space with its INTEGRITY-178B real-time operating system having been certified to EAL 6+, the highest common criteria security level achieved for an operating system.
Green Hills products are broadly deployed across multiple application domains, particularly in aerospace and defense. With customers include Boeing and Lockheed Martin. And in automotive, with many top OEM and Tier 1 customers, including Toyota and Ford. We expect to leverage the strength of both companies to drive embedded system security and safety, open up new market opportunities and accelerate growth for both companies.
I will review other highlights for Q4 and 2018, beginning with functional verification, which remains the fastest growing challenge for our customers. Cadence Verification Suite had a good 2018, with revenue growth in the high teens led by strong demand for Palladium Z1. Palladium Z1 won 22 new customers during the year with significant expansions at several existing customers. And Protium, our FPGA prototyping solution, also grew steadily.
Growing adoptions of our Xcelium simulator was highlighted by several market-shaping customers, expanding their commitment to our technology during the year.
The IP outsourcing trend continued and strong execution of our refined IP strategy delivered double-digit growth for our IP business in 2018. Tensilica had a good year with strong loyalty growth, and we maintained our lead in audio applications with growing adoption in vision and key wins in automotive severance and augmented reality applications.
We have engaged with several customers for our new Tensilica DNA 100 processor, which is ideal for embedded inferencing applications, and will be generally available to customers in the first half of the year.
For the cloud data center market, earlier in the year, we announced the first DDR5 test chip. And in Q4, we begin selling our new 112-gig Longreach 30 IP in 7-nanometer technology.
On digital and finance, we're particularly pleased with the growing proliferation of our solutions at the most advanced nodes with market-shaping customers.
We grew our relationship with MediaTek to include the full digital flow from synthesis through signoff. Customers tape out more than 80 7-nanometer designs in 2018 using our digital solutions, and we had 23 full flow wins.
We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs. And we delivered 2 3-nanometer test chips in 2018. 
I look at some analog front, we have growing adoptions of both our Virtuoso RF and photonic solutions. And one of the very last remaining large customers that was not using our flagship Virtuoso layout solution, committed to adopting it.
Last June, we introduced Cadence Cloud in collaboration with major cloud industry players: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We are pleased with the adoption momentum as we continue to lead the industry transition to the cloud.
Now before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize my comments. Continued execution of our System Design Enablement strategy led to a broad strength across our product lines, and particularly in aerospace and defense vertical. I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, the leader in embedded safety and security software. And it was a good year for our Verification Suite products and as well as our IP business.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our outlook."

Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the",636,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.
Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606 for fiscal 2018. The numbers I present today for our fourth quarter and 2018 are based on these new rules, unless otherwise stated.
2018 was our transition year to ASC 606. And to provide a more direct comparison against our 2017 results, we show our quarterly and annual results under both sets of rules for 2018.
Now let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $570 million for the quarter and $2.138 billion for the year. Q4 and 2018 both benefited from the shift in timing of revenue recognized on some hardware systems that we previously expected to deliver in 2019. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 31% for the fourth quarter and just over 30% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.35 for the quarter and $1.23 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 for the quarter and $1.87 for the year.
For the old rules, which can be directly compared to 2017, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $579 million and $2.146 billion for the year. And also benefited from the earlier-than-expected delivery of hardware systems in Q4 2018. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 30% for both Q4 and the year. GAAP EPS was $0.36 for the quarter and $1.25 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 for the quarter and $1.88 for the year. The recurring revenue mix for the full year was approximately 90%. The mix for Q4 was approximately 85%, slightly lower than usual due to the extra hardware systems delivered in Q4.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash totaled $533 million at year-end. Toward the end of December, we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the investment in Green Hills Software. As a result, debts outstanding at quarter-end was $450 million. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $132 million and $605 million for the full year. DSOs were 48 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 46 days. Our DSO target for 2019 remains 45 days.
Enduring Q4, we repurchased $100 million of Cadence shares. Now for our guidance. Note that we had completed the transition to the new revenue accounting rules, so going forward, all numbers will be reported on an ASC 606 basis.
For fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.33 to $1.43, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.97 to $2.07. We expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence common stock during 2019.
For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $575 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.38; and non-GAAP EPS range in the range of $0.48 to $0.50. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis and the CFO commentary available in our website.
In conclusion, I am pleased with our execution, financial performance and progress across all of our businesses. Our investments are paying off and our System Design Enablement strategy is driving results and creating value for customers and shareholders.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

We are pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for 2018, delivering 10% year-over-year revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
While the overall macro environment remain mixed, we remain confident in the technology trends, including AI, machine learning, cloud data center and 5G that continue to drive strong design activity.
Our System Design Enablement strategy is to continue growing our core EDA and IP business; broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and importantly, expand into newer adjacent areas. I'm delighted to report that we have continued to make significant progress in all these areas. 
We achieved strong growth across our product lines in our core business, which included a breakthrough, wide ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company.
In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Samsung through their broader adoption of our digital, custom and verification products. 
We expanded our long-term partnership with Analog Devices for their development of mixed-signal solutions for IoT, automotive, medical and industrial applications, including the adoption of several of our new digital and verification products.
We made good progress in vertical segments such as the data center cloud, automotive, and particularly, in aerospace and defense. We have won business with some of the top companies in this space, including GE Aviation and BAE Systems, and we finished the year with major core EDA and IP contract with a major aerospace and defense contractor.
Earlier in the year, we won a significant research contract with DARPA and have made very good progress developing advanced machine learning technologies to enhance automations and productivity.
And as we look at expanding beyond EDA, I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with the Green Hills Software. Cadence invested about $150 million in Green Hills, representing our ownership interest of approximately 16%.
Our investment is important because safety and security are some of the greatest concerns in the increasingly hyperconnected world, especially in the critical industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive and medical.
Green Hills is the leading player in the embedded safety and security software space, with its INTEGRITY-178B real-time operating system having been certified to EAL6+, the highest Common Criteria security level achieved for an operating system.
Green Hills products are broadly deployed across multiple application domains, particularly in aerospace and defense, with customers include Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and in automotive, with many top OEM and Tier 1 customers, including Toyota and Ford. 
We expect to leverage the strength of both companies to drive embedded system security and safety, open up new market opportunities and accelerate growth for both companies.
I will now review other highlights for Q4 and 2018, beginning with Functional Verification, which remains the fastest growing challenge for our customers. 
Cadence Verification Suite had a good 2018 with revenue growth in the high teens, led by strong demand for Palladium Z1. Palladium Z1 won 22 new customers during the year, with significant expansions at several existing customers. And Protium, our FPGA prototyping solution, also grew steadily.
Growing adoptions of our Xcelium simulator was highlighted by several market-shaping customers, expanding their commitment to our technology during the year.
The IP outsourcing trend continued, and strong execution of our refined IP strategy delivered double-digit growth for our IP business in 2018. 
Tensilica had a good year with strong royalty growth, and we maintained our lead in audio applications, with growing adoption in vision and key wins in automotive, surveillance and augmented reality applications.
We have engaged with several customers for our new Tensilica DNA 100 Processor, which is ideal for embedded inferencing applications, and will be generally available to customers in the first half of the year.
For the cloud/data center market, earlier in the year, we announced the first DDR5 test chip. And in Q4, we began selling our new 112-gig long reach SerDes IP in 7-nanometer technology.
On Digital and Signoff, we are particularly pleased with the growing proliferation of our solutions at the most advanced nodes, with market-shaping customers.
We grew our relationship with MediaTek to include the full digital flow from synthesis through signoff. Customers taped out more than 80 7-nanometer designs in 2018 using our digital solutions, and we had 23 full flow wins.
We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs, and we delivered 2 3-nanometer test chips in 2018. 
On the Custom/Analog front, we have growing adoptions of both our Virtuoso RF and photonic solutions. And one of the very last remaining large customers that was not using our flagship Virtuoso layout solution, committed to adopting it.
Last June, we introduced Cadence Cloud in collaboration with major cloud industry players Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We are pleased with the adoption momentum as we continue to lead the industry transition to the cloud.
Now before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize my comments. Continued execution of our System Design Enablement strategy led to a broad strength across our product lines, and particularly in aerospace and defense vertical. I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, the leader in embedded safety and security software. And it was a good year for our Verification Suite products and as well as our IP business.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our outlook."

Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the",635,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.
Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606 for fiscal 2018. The numbers I present today for our fourth quarter and 2018 are based on these new rules unless otherwise stated.
2018 was our transition year to ASC 606. And to provide a more direct comparison against our 2017 results, we show our quarterly and annual results under both sets of rules for 2018.
Now let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $570 million for the quarter and $2.138 billion for the year. Q4 and 2018 both benefited from the shift in timing of revenue recognized on some hardware systems that we previously expected to deliver in 2019. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 31% for the fourth quarter and just over 30% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.35 for the quarter and $1.23 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 for the quarter and $1.87 for the year.
For the old rules, which can be directly compared to 2017, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $579 million and $2.146 billion for the year, and also benefited from the earlier-than-expected delivery of hardware systems in Q4 2018. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 30% for both Q4 and the year. GAAP EPS was $0.36 for the quarter and $1.25 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 for the quarter and $1.88 for the year. The recurring revenue mix for the full year was approximately 90%. The mix for Q4 was approximately 85%, slightly lower than usual due to the extra hardware systems delivered in Q4.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash totaled $533 million at year-end. Toward the end of December, we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the investment in Green Hills Software. As a result, debts outstanding at quarter-end was $450 million. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $132 million and $605 million for the full year. DSOs were 48 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 46 days. Our DSO target for 2019 remains 45 days.
And during Q4, we repurchased $100 million of Cadence shares. 
Now for our guidance. Note that we had completed the transition to the new revenue accounting rules, so going forward, all numbers will be reported on an ASC 606 basis.
For fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.33 to $1.43. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.97 to $2.07. We expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence common stock during 2019.
For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $575 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in range of $0.48 to $0.50. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In conclusion, I am pleased with our execution, financial performance and progress across all of our businesses. Our investments are paying off and our System Design Enablement strategy is driving results and creating value for customers and shareholders.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

We are pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for 2018, delivering 10% year-over-year revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
While the overall macro environment remain mixed, we remain confident in the technology trends, including AI, machine learning, cloud data center and 5G that continue to drive strong design activity.
Our System Design Enablement strategy is to continue growing our core EDA and IP business; broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and importantly, expand into newer adjacent areas. 
I'm delighted to report that we have continued to make significant progress in all these areas. We achieved strong growth across our product lines in our core business, which included a breakthrough, wide-ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company.
In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Samsung through their broader adoption of our digital, custom and verification products. 
We expanded our long-term partnership with Analog Devices for their development of mixed-signal solutions for IoT, automotive, medical and industrial applications, including the adoption of several of our new digital and verification products.
We made good progress in vertical segments such as the data center cloud, automotive and particularly in aerospace and defense. We have won business with some of the top companies in this space, including GE Aviation and BAE Systems, and we finished the year with major core EDA and IP contract with a major aerospace and defense contractor.
Earlier in the year, we won a significant research contract with DARPA and have made very good progress developing advanced machine learning technologies to enhance automation and productivity.
And as we look at expanding beyond EDA, I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software. Cadence invested about $150 million in Green Hills, representing our ownership interest of approximately 16%.
Our investment is important because safety and security are some of the greatest concerns in the increasingly hyperconnected world, especially in the critical industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive and medical.
Green Hills is the leading player in the embedded safety and security software space, with its INTEGRITY-178B real-time operating system having been certified to EAL6+, the highest Common Criteria security level achieved for an operating system.
Green Hills' products are broadly deployed across multiple application domains, particularly in aerospace and defense, with customers include Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and in automotive, with many top OEM and Tier 1 customers, including Toyota and Ford. 
We expect to leverage the strength of both companies to drive embedded system security and safety, open up new market opportunities and accelerate growth for both companies.
I will now review other highlights for Q4 and 2018, beginning with Functional Verification, which remains the fastest-growing challenge for our customers. 
Cadence Verification Suite had a good 2018 with revenue growth in the high teens, led by strong demand for Palladium Z1. Palladium Z1 won 22 new customers during the year, with significant expansions at several existing customers. And Protium, our FPGA based prototyping solution, also grew steadily.
Growing adoptions of our Xcelium simulator was highlighted by several market-shaping customers, expanding their commitment to our technology during the year.
The IP outsourcing trend continued, and strong execution of our refined IP strategy delivered double-digit growth for our IP business in 2018. 
Tensilica had a good year with strong royalty growth, and we maintained our lead in audio applications, with growing adoption in vision and key wins in automotive, surveillance and augmented reality applications. We have engaged with several customers for our new Tensilica DNA 100 Processor, which is ideal for embedded inferencing applications, and will be generally available to customers in the first half of the year.
For the cloud/datacenter market, earlier in the year, we announced the first DDR5 test chip. And in Q4, we began selling our new 112-gig long reach SerDes IP in 7-nanometer technology.
On Digital and Signoff, we are particularly pleased with the growing proliferation of our solutions at the most advanced nodes, with market-shaping customers.
We grew our relationship with MediaTek to include the full digital flow from synthesis through signoff. 
Customers taped out more than 80 7-nanometer designs in 2018 using our digital solutions, and we had 23 full flow wins.
We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs, and we delivered 2 3-nanometer test chips in 2018. 
On the Custom/Analog front, we have growing adoptions of both our Virtuoso RF and photonic solutions. And one of the very last remaining large customers that was not using our flagship Virtuoso layout solution, committed to adopting it.
Last June, we introduced Cadence Cloud in collaboration with major cloud industry players, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We are pleased with the adoption momentum as we continue to lead the industry transition to the cloud.
Now before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize my comments. Continued execution of our System Design Enablement strategy led to a broad strength across our product lines, and particularly in aerospace and defense vertical. I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, the leader in embedded safety and security software. And it was a good year for our Verification Suite products and as well as our IP business.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our outlook."

Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the",635,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.
Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606 for fiscal 2018. The numbers I present today for our fourth quarter and 2018 are based on these new rules unless otherwise stated. 2018 was our transition year to ASC 606. And to provide a more direct comparison against our 2017 results, we show our quarterly and annual results under both sets of rules for 2018.
Now let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $570 million for the quarter and $2.138 billion for the year. Q4 and 2018 both benefited from the shift in timing of revenue recognized on some hardware systems that we previously expected to deliver in 2019. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 31% for the fourth quarter and just over 30% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.35 for the quarter and $1.23 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 for the quarter and $1.87 for the year.
For the old rules, which can be directly compared to 2017, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $579 million and $2.146 billion for the year, and also benefited from the earlier-than-expected delivery of hardware systems in Q4 2018. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 30% for both Q4 and the year. GAAP EPS was $0.36 for the quarter and $1.25 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 for the quarter and $1.88 for the year. The recurring revenue mix for the full year was approximately 90%. The mix for Q4 was approximately 85%, slightly lower than usual due to the extra hardware systems delivered in Q4.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash totaled $533 million at year-end. Toward the end of December, we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the investment in Green Hills Software. As a result, debt outstanding at quarter-end was $450 million. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $132 million and $605 million for the full year. DSOs were 48 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 46 days. Our DSO target for 2019 remains 45 days. And during Q4, we repurchased $100 million of Cadence shares. 
Now for our guidance. Note that we have completed the transition to the new revenue accounting rules, so going forward, all numbers will be reported on an ASC 606 basis.
For fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.33 to $1.43; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.97 to $2.07. We expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million. And we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence common stock during 2019.
For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $575 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.38; and non-GAAP EPS in range of $0.48 to $0.50. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In conclusion, I am pleased with our execution, financial performance and progress across all of our businesses. Our investments are paying off and our System Design Enablement strategy is driving results and creating value for customers and shareholders.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

And so I think they continue to do well. We haven't seen any shakeout yet and then -- because the application market is so big. And on the other hand, some of the very big company then in the hyperscale player and also some of the system player, they are deploying massively into the AI/machine learning R&D development. We are delighted to support them with our tool and IP. And clearly, we have a lot to offer. Beside our tool, EDA tool, we actually apply the AI/machine learning into our tool. We see significant improvement on that and customer love it and encouraging us continue to [ put down ] on it. And then the other part is clearly our Tensilica, they turned out to be very, very important for the embedded inference applications and also for the augmented reality applications. So the DNA 100 have been very well received. We are excited about it. So I think, overall, stay tuned.

So first question you have about the semiconductor to the system company and even service provider, the differences of supporting them. Clearly, they are all demanding customer. We love them. And in terms of system companies, there are some differences. They are looking at the total, the performance power envelope and a system modeling requirement. And we are very well positioned for providing that. Beside the EDA tool, we also have the packaging, PC board layout and system modeling and system simulation. That is very, very compelling for them to come to us. And then the other part, we also understanding their requirement better in terms of how to serve them and support them. And then -- and they are very much -- time-to-market is more important to them. And then we're able to meet their schedule, meet their timetable and then deliver the product from the system now where they are more comprehensive and that they are satisfying the requirement, that is critically important to them. And then also, as you can tell, many of our service provider, they're also building up their silicone and subsystem ASIC model to meet their requirement and we are excited about doing that. So I think, overall, and then with both semiconductor and systems side, we are doing very well. The semiconductor side, I highlight a couple of them. Samsung, clearly broader adoptions of our tool; MediaTek, adopting our full digital flow from synthesis to signoff; and of course, we are really, really excited about our marquee semiconductor U.S. company. And that explain to you why we have increased the rec for the AE because the demand requirement to support this iconic, game-changing opportunity for us, we have to support them and in a very timely fashion.

We are pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for 2018, delivering 10% year-over-year revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
While the overall macro environment remain mixed, we remain confident in the technology trends, including AI, machine learning, cloud data center and 5G that continue to drive strong design activity.
Our System Design Enablement strategy is to continue growing our core EDA and IP business; broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and importantly, expand into newer adjacent areas. 
I'm delighted to report that we have continued to make significant progress in all these areas. We achieved strong growth across our product lines in our core business, which included a breakthrough, wide-ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company.
In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Samsung through their broader adoption of our digital, custom and verification products. 
We expanded our long-term partnership with Analog Devices for their development of mixed-signal solutions for IoT, automotive, medical and industrial applications, including the adoption of several of our new digital and verification products.
We made good progress in vertical segments such as the data center cloud, automotive and particularly in aerospace and defense. We have won business with some of the top companies in this space, including GE Aviation and BAE Systems, and we finished the year with major core EDA and IP contract with a major aerospace and defense contractor.
Earlier in the year, we won a significant research contract with DARPA and have made very good progress developing advanced machine learning technologies to enhance automation and productivity.
And as we look at expanding beyond EDA, I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software. Cadence invested about $150 million in Green Hills, representing our ownership interest of approximately 16%.
Our investment is important because safety and security are some of the greatest concerns in the increasingly hyperconnected world, especially in the critical industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive and medical.
Green Hills is the leading player in the embedded safety and security software space, with its INTEGRITY-178B real-time operating system having been certified to EAL6+, the highest Common Criteria security level achieved for an operating system.
Green Hills' products are broadly deployed across multiple application domains, particularly in aerospace and defense, with customers include Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and in automotive, with many top OEM and Tier 1 customers, including Toyota and Ford. 
We expect to leverage the strength of both companies to drive embedded system security and safety, open up new market opportunities and accelerate growth for both companies.
I will now review other highlights for Q4 and 2018, beginning with Functional Verification, which remains the fastest-growing challenge for our customers. 
Cadence Verification Suite had a good 2018 with revenue growth in the high teens, led by strong demand for Palladium Z1. Palladium Z1 won 22 new customers during the year, with significant expansions at several existing customers. And Protium, our FPGA based prototyping solution, also grew steadily.
Growing adoptions of our Xcelium simulator was highlighted by several market-shaping customers, expanding their commitment to our technology during the year.
The IP outsourcing trend continued, and strong execution of our refined IP strategy delivered double-digit growth for our IP business in 2018. 
Tensilica had a good year with strong royalty growth, and we maintained our lead in audio applications, with growing adoption in vision and key wins in automotive, surveillance and augmented reality applications. We have engaged with several customers for our new Tensilica DNA 100 Processor, which is ideal for embedded inferencing applications, and will be generally available to customers in the first half of the year.
For the cloud/datacenter market, earlier in the year, we announced the first DDR5 test chip. And in Q4, we began selling our new 112-gig long reach SerDes IP in 7-nanometer technology.
On Digital and Signoff, we are particularly pleased with the growing proliferation of our solutions at the most advanced nodes, with market-shaping customers.
We grew our relationship with MediaTek to include the full digital flow from synthesis through signoff. 
Customers taped out more than 80 7-nanometer designs in 2018 using our digital solutions, and we had 23 full flow wins.
We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs, and we delivered 2 3-nanometer test chips in 2018. 
On the Custom/Analog front, we have growing adoptions of both our Virtuoso RF and photonic solutions. And one of the very last remaining large customers that was not using our flagship Virtuoso layout solution, committed to adopting it.
Last June, we introduced Cadence Cloud in collaboration with major cloud industry players, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. We are pleased with the adoption momentum as we continue to lead the industry transition to the cloud.
Now before turning it over to John, let me quickly summarize my comments. Continued execution of our System Design Enablement strategy led to a broad strength across our product lines, and particularly in aerospace and defense vertical. I'm very excited about our new strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, the leader in embedded safety and security software. And it was a good year for our Verification Suite products and as well as our IP business.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our outlook."

Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the",635,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. Cadence exceeded all of its key operating metrics and delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.
Before we get into Q4 results, let me remind you that Cadence adopted the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606 for fiscal 2018. The numbers I present today for our fourth quarter and 2018 are based on these new rules unless otherwise stated. 2018 was our transition year to ASC 606. And to provide a more direct comparison against our 2017 results, we show our quarterly and annual results under both sets of rules for 2018.
Now let's go through the key results for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. As reported, total revenue was $570 million for the quarter and $2.138 billion for the year. Q4 and 2018 both benefited from the shift in timing of revenue recognized on some hardware systems that we previously expected to deliver in 2019. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 31% for the fourth quarter and just over 30% for the year. GAAP EPS was $0.35 for the quarter and $1.23 for the year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 for the quarter and $1.87 for the year.
For the old rules, which can be directly compared to 2017, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $579 million and $2.146 billion for the year, and also benefited from the earlier-than-expected delivery of hardware systems in Q4 2018. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was just over 30% for both Q4 and the year. GAAP EPS was $0.36 for the quarter and $1.25 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 for the quarter and $1.88 for the year. The recurring revenue mix for the full year was approximately 90%. The mix for Q4 was approximately 85%, slightly lower than usual due to the extra hardware systems delivered in Q4.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash totaled $533 million at year-end. Toward the end of December, we drew down $100 million on our revolving credit facility to fund the investment in Green Hills Software. As a result, debt outstanding at quarter-end was $450 million. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $132 million and $605 million for the full year. DSOs were 48 days. Under the old rules, DSOs were 46 days. Our DSO target for 2019 remains 45 days. And during Q4, we repurchased $100 million of Cadence shares. 
Now for our guidance. Note that we have completed the transition to the new revenue accounting rules, so going forward, all numbers will be reported on an ASC 606 basis.
For fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 31%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.33 to $1.43; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.97 to $2.07. We expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million. And we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence common stock during 2019.
For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $575 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.38; and non-GAAP EPS in range of $0.48 to $0.50. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In conclusion, I am pleased with our execution, financial performance and progress across all of our businesses. Our investments are paying off and our System Design Enablement strategy is driving results and creating value for customers and shareholders.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the first quarter of 2019, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the year and John will provide more detail shortly. While there's some uncertainty in the overall raw macro environment, we are confident about the multiple trends that have continued to drive strong design activity. In addition to technology trends, like AI and 5G, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicone, new silicone startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industry industrial applications.
Our business is mission-critical to silicone development which is the cornerstone of all design activity. As we have stated, our System Design Enablement, or SDE strategy, drives growth in our core EDA and IP business; broadens our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and guides our expansion into newer adjacent areas.
We executed well on this strategy. And today, I want to highlight its mixed phase which we're calling intelligent system design. The foundation of this strategy continues to be delivering design excellence via our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains; and pervasive intelligence, where we will apply AI and our algorithm know-how to our core business and specific verticals.
Our intelligent system design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our common total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimated $30 billion over the next 5 years. To highlight some of this -- some of our recent activities in the system innovation space, in Q1, we announced a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software which opens new opportunities in the estimated more than $3 billion embedded system, safety and security space. And earlier this month, we enter the system analysis market, an estimated $12.5 billion total addressable market opportunity. By introducing our first product, Clarity 3D Solver, our next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulation. Clarity is a true 3D software which delivers up to 10x faster simulation performance while virtually unlimited capacity without compromising accuracy.
 [indiscernible] used state of art distributed multiprocessing technology, making it uniquely optimized in on-premise distributor computing and has been endorsed by Paradigm and HiSilicon.
Turning to our core business. Our Digital and Signoff business achieved 12% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong adoption by new customers and proliferation by existing customers at advanced nodes. Today, more than 100 7-nanometer designs have taped out using our digital solution in multiple 5-nanometer designs are underway using our solution as well.
Our hardware-assisted verification products, an important part of our Verification Suite, had another good quarter. Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 2 new customers that are doing machine learning design including SambaNova Systems.
We also have 13 repeat orders including 3 significant expansions, one of which was at Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company. Our Protium S1 prototyping platform, which enables early software development also added 2 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. Palladium cloud continued its steady momentum and now has more than 10 customers, several of which have made repeat orders.
Our IP business also showed double-digit growth year-over-year. Tensilica continue to win sockets for machine learning, vision and audio applications in the automotive, consumer and civilian segments, adding 8 new customers in the quarter.
In the Design IP space, our new 112-gig long-reach 30 IP was adopted by a Marquis semiconductor company and we've launched the industry's first complete silicon proven LPDDR 5 silicone. As I had said earlier, our strategy broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals. One of our most successful targeted verticals is aerospace and defense. While we recently announced that we are working with Northrop Grumman with our EDI IP solutions, the product has shortened product development cycle and advanced nodes tapeouts.
Lastly, I want to highlight the new Cadence Cloud platform, the latest addition to our cloud portfolio which extends our cloud leadership in EDA and provides customer with very compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. Enables hybrid cloud environment and is ideal for serving peak demand. It provides fast and easy access to preinstall Cadence Design tools in either AWS or Azure cloud environment. It was used by Beaufort network to achieve a 10x productivity improvement running Cadence, Tempus, signoffs solution on their 7-nanometer networking tips.
With that, I like to turn over the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

Cadence achieved broad-based growth across all lines of our business during Q1, with demand for hardware and IP exceeding our original expectations. Revenue, operating margin and cash from operations were all strong in Q1 and as hardware and IP have become a larger part of our overall business, our recurring revenue mix percentage is now in the high '80s.
Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $577 million; non-GAAP operating margin was 32%; GAAP EPS was $0.43; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $539 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $400 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $185 million. DSO were 42 days. And during Q1, we repurchased $81 million of Cadence shares.
Now we will provide our updated guidance. For Q2, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $575 million to $585 million; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.34 to $0.36; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is as follows: revenue in the range of $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.47; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.12; operating cash flow in the range of $665 million to $705 million; and for the year, we expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in Q1. We achieved strong operating results highlighted by 11% year-over-year revenue growth; 32% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis; and the generation of $185 million of operating cash in the quarter.
And looking at our revised outlook for the year, I'm pleased to see improvements in operating income consistently flowing through to cash as illustrated by the increase in our operating cash flow guidance for the year. We'd like to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for a solid start to 2019 and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

I think we all know from the marketplace, geopolitical and also some of the slowdown in some segment of the industry like automotive and others, but we are excited in a couple of drivers, and especially, AI and then 5G and autonomous driving and also the industrial age. That is something I am very passionate about. I think we're moving into, I'll call it, a big data environment. It's all about data, enough data analytics. In a way it's driving a lot of new requirements for the semiconductor. So one, I mentioned, about the workload-specific or you call it domain-specific process computing. General-purpose CPU, GPU, there's a good place for them. But right now the workload have changed so we call it the workload-specific, more application-related. And that's also driving not just the computing and also the, clearly, a lot of more excited about the memory. There's some new innovation in memory. there is new innovation in storage and some of you have heard about the NVME controller, and disaggregation, auto storage. Got massive, massive data that you need to disaggregate in storage and network and also the other parties, they're high-speed connectivity, they're able to scale the connectivity speed that's required in the hyperscale. So all this are kind of driving a very strong design activity and we are in the middle of it and are well positioned to capture that. And that's why everything from our point of view, the design activity is increased substantially. We are excited about disappointing some of our customers to really embark on some of these opportunities."

The next thing we're looking at is the whole we call it the system analysis space, and that is about $4.5 billion. And it is about time to have some innovation solution to be able to provide an account enabled scalable and then using our strength to apply because you do recall, we also have the PCB business and also the 3D technology so that we can really apply that into this 3D software, and that is just the beginning of the EM, electromagnetics field simulation area. And then stay tuned. We have continued the development and investing in this space. And it's a big market, $12.5 billion. And customer love it. And so far the initial feedback from our potential customer, and we highlight, too, that our endorse our approach and then see the benefit of the performance and we're excited about. And then finally, we're going to use that to the pervasive intelligence using the AI and machine learning, and basically we are going to apply in Chile call it an inside and outside. Inside basically using AI machine learning to drive performance improvement, productivity and performance improvement across all of our product line in term of EDA tools. And we already see significant improvement in that. And then finally, we are also working with our leading customer using AI to optimize the airflow and methodology so that the consumer can really drive the performance like machine learning, day of learning and other applications. And that is kind of our approach."

Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the first quarter of 2019, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our",798,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the first quarter of 2019, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the year, and John will provide more detail shortly. While there's some uncertainty in the overall raw macro environment, we are confident about the multiple trends that have continued to drive strong design activity. In addition to technology trends, like AI and 5G, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicon, new silicon startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industry -- industrial applications.
Our business is mission-critical to silicon development which is cornerstone of all design activity. As we have stated, our System Design Enablement, or SDE strategy, drives growth in our core EDA and IP business; broadens our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and guides our expansion into newer, adjacent areas.
We executed well on this strategy. And today, I want to highlight its next phase which we're calling intelligent system design. The foundation of this strategy continues to be delivering design excellence via our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains; and pervasive intelligence, where we will apply AI and our algorithm know-how to our core business and specific verticals.
Our intelligent system design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimated $30 billion over the next 5 years. To highlight some of this -- some of our recent activities in the system innovation space, in Q1, we announced a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software which opens new opportunities in the estimated more than $3 billion embedded system, safety and security space. And earlier this month, we entered the system analysis market, an estimated $4.5 billion total addressable market opportunity, by introducing our first product, Clarity 3D Solver, a next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulation. Clarity is a true 3D solver which delivers up to 10x faster simulation performance while virtually unlimited capacity without compromising accuracy.
Clarity used state of art, distributed, multiprocessing technology, making it uniquely optimized for the cloud and on-premise distributed computing and has been endorsed by Teradyne and HiSilicon.
Turning to our core business. Our digital and signoff business achieved 12% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong adoption by new customers and proliferation of -- by existing customers at advanced nodes. Today, more than 100 7-nanometer designs have taped out using our digital solution, and multiple 5-nanometer designs are underway using our solution as well.
Our hardware-assisted verification products, an important part of our Verification Suite, had another good quarter. Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 2 new customers that are doing machine learning designs including SambaNova Systems.
We also have 13 repeat orders including 3 significant expansions, one of which was at Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company. Our Protium S1 prototyping platform, which enables early software development also added 2 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. Palladium cloud continued its steady momentum and now has more than 10 customers, several of which have made repeat orders.
Our IP business also showed double-digit growth year-over-year. Tensilica continue to win sockets for machine learning, vision and audio applications in the automotive, consumer and surveillance segments, adding 8 new customers in the quarter.
In the Design IP space, our new 112-gig long-reach SerDes IP was adopted by a marquee semiconductor company, and we launched the industry first complete silicon-proven LPDDR5 silicon. As I had said earlier, our strategy broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals. One of our most successful targeted verticals is aerospace and defense where we recently announced that we are working with Northrop Grumman, where our EDA IP solutions has supported a shortened product development cycle and advanced nodes tapeouts.
Lastly, I want to highlight the new Cadence CloudBurst platform, the latest addition to our cloud portfolio which extends our cloud leadership in EDA and provides customer with very compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. CloudBurst enables hybrid cloud environment and is ideal for serving peak demand. It provides fast and easy access to preinstall Cadence Design tools in either AWS or Azure cloud environment. It was used by Barefoot Networks to achieve a 10x productivity improvement running Cadence Tempus Timing Signoff Solution on their 7-nanometer networking chips.
With that, I want to turn over the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

Cadence achieved broad-based growth across all lines of our business during Q1, with demand for hardware and IP exceeding our original expectations. Revenue, operating margin and cash from operations were all strong in Q1, and as hardware and IP have become a larger part of our overall business, our recurring revenue mix percentage is now in the high 80s.
Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $577 million; non-GAAP operating margin was 32%; GAAP EPS was $0.43; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $539 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $400 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $185 million. DSOs were 42 days. And during Q1, we repurchased $81 million of Cadence shares.
Now we will provide our updated guidance. For Q2, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $575 million to $585 million; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.34 to $0.36; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is as follows: revenue in the range of $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.47; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.12; operating cash flow in the range of $665 million to $705 million; and for the year, we expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in Q1. We achieved strong operating results highlighted by 11% year-over-year revenue growth; 32% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis; and the generation of $185 million of operating cash in the quarter.
And looking at our revised outlook for the year, I'm pleased to see improvements in operating income consistently flowing through to cash as illustrated by the increase in our operating cash flow guidance for the year. We'd like to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for a solid start to 2019, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

They're something that I'm very passionate about. And -- because we are moving into, I call it, big data environment. It's all about data and data analytics. So in a way, driving a lot of new requirements for the semiconductor. So one, I mentioned, about the workload-specific or you call it domain-specific process computing. General-purpose CPU, GPU, there's a good place for them. But right now the workload have changed so we call it the workload-specific, more application-related. And that's also driving not just the computing and also the, clearly, a lot of more exciting about the memory. There's some new innovation on memory. There's some new innovation on storage. And some of you have heard about the NVMe controller, disaggregation of the storage because of the massive, massive data that you need to be -- disaggregate the storage and network. And also the other parties, their high-speed connectivity, they're able to scale the connectivity speed that's required in the hyperscale. So all this are going to be driving a very strong design activity, and we are in the middle of it. We are well positioned to capture that. And that's why I think the -- from our point of view, the design activity is increased substantially. We are excited about supporting some of our customers to really embark on some of these opportunities."

All our EDA tools are continuing to drive the growth with the semiconductor company and also system company to drive differentiation. And then second part we're starting to address -- begin to address is that system innovation. And so clearly, the opportunity in front of us is this whole embedded system, safety and security. Our partnership with Green Hills is a very important part of our strategy. And then now we're starting to move into the system analysis space. So embedded space, about $3 billion. And then the market analysis is about -- clearly, system analysis is about $4.5 billion. And then so I think overall, we'll continue to -- marching forward, stay tuned, and then we're going to be -- over time, we're going to be -- highlight to you some of the success we have. And then clearly, on the competition side, on the system analysis, there are a couple of them I think you quite know -- well known. They have some more legacy solutions. And then -- but the customers, over time, require increase on the system complexity and also shift less approach, doing more simulation and then larger design, and that will require solutions that need more capacity and also higher performance. And that really plays into our strength in terms of algorithm expertise and massive distributing, multiprocessing capability. And so I think those are the things that really we find a unique opportunity, a unique qualification we have to play in this market."

Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the first quarter of 2019, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the year, and John will provide more details shortly. While there's some uncertainty in the overall macro environment, we are confident about the multiple trends that have continued to drive strong design activity. In addition to technology trends, like AI and 5G, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicon, new silicon startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industry -- industrial applications.
Our business is mission-critical to silicon development which is cornerstone of all design activity. As we have stated, our System Design Enablement, or SDE strategy, drives growth in our core EDA and IP business; broadens our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and guides our expansion into newer, adjacent areas.
We executed well on this strategy. And today, I want to highlight its next phase which we're calling intelligent system design. The foundation of this strategy continues to be delivering design excellence via our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains; and pervasive intelligence, where we will apply AI and our algorithm know-how to our core business and specific verticals.
Our intelligent system design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimated $30 billion over the next 5 years. To highlight some of this -- some of our recent activities in the system innovation space, in Q1, we announced a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software which opens new opportunities in the estimated more than $3 billion embedded system, safety and security space. And earlier this month, we entered the system analysis market, an estimated $4.5 billion total addressable market opportunity, by introducing our first product, Clarity 3D Solver, a next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulation. Clarity is a true 3D solver which delivers up to 10x faster simulation performance while virtually unlimited capacity without compromising accuracy.
Clarity used state of art, distributed, multiprocessing technology, making it uniquely optimized for the cloud and on-premise distributed computing and has been endorsed by Teradyne and HiSilicon.
Turning to our core business. Our digital and signoff business achieved 12% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong adoption by new customers and proliferation of -- by existing customers at advanced nodes. Today, more than 100 7-nanometer designs have taped out using our digital solution, and multiple 5-nanometer designs are underway using our solution as well.
Our hardware-assisted verification products, an important part of our Verification Suite, had another good quarter. Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 2 new customers that are doing machine learning designs including SambaNova Systems.
We also have 13 repeat orders including 3 significant expansions, one of which was at Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company. Our Protium S1 prototyping platform, which enables early software development also added 2 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. Palladium cloud continued its steady momentum and now has more than 10 customers, several of which have made repeat orders.
Our IP business also showed double-digit growth year-over-year. Tensilica continue to win sockets for machine learning, vision and audio applications in the automotive, consumer and surveillance segments, adding 8 new customers in the quarter.
In the Design IP space, our new 112-gig long-reach SerDes IP was adopted by a marquee semiconductor company, and we launched the industry first complete silicon-proven LPDDR5 silicon. As I had said earlier, our strategy broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals. One of our most successful targeted verticals is aerospace and defense where we recently announced that we are working with Northrop Grumman, where our EDA IP solutions has supported a shortened product development cycle and advanced nodes tapeouts.
Lastly, I want to highlight the new Cadence CloudBurst platform, the latest addition to our cloud portfolio which extends our cloud leadership in EDA and provides customer with very compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. CloudBurst enables hybrid cloud environment and is ideal for serving peak demand. It provides fast and easy access to preinstall Cadence Design tools in either AWS or Azure cloud environment. It was used by Barefoot Networks to achieve a 10x productivity improvement running Cadence Tempus Timing Signoff Solution on their 7-nanometer networking chips.
With that, I want to turn over the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

Cadence achieved broad-based growth across all lines of our business during Q1, with demand for hardware and IP exceeding our original expectations. Revenue, operating margin and cash from operations were all strong in Q1, and as hardware and IP have become a larger part of our overall business, our recurring revenue mix percentage is now in the high 80s.
Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $577 million; non-GAAP operating margin was 32%; GAAP EPS was $0.43; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $539 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $400 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $185 million. DSOs were 42 days. And during Q1, we repurchased $81 million of Cadence shares.
Now we will provide our updated guidance. For Q2, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $575 million to $585 million; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.34 to $0.36; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is as follows: revenue in the range of $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.47; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.12; operating cash flow in the range of $665 million to $705 million; and for the year, we expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in Q1. We achieved strong operating results highlighted by 11% year-over-year revenue growth; 32% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis; and the generation of $185 million of operating cash in the quarter.
And looking at our revised outlook for the year, I'm pleased to see improvements in operating income consistently flowing through to cash as illustrated by the increase in our operating cash flow guidance for the year. We'd like to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for a solid start to 2019, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.

I think we all know from the marketplace, geopolitical and also some of the slowdown in some segment of the industry, like automotive and others, but we're excited on a couple of drivers, and especially, AI and then the 5G and autonomous driving and then also the industrial edge. They're something that I'm very passionate about. And -- because we are moving into, I call it, big data environment. It's all about data and data analytics. So in a way, driving a lot of new requirements for the semiconductor. So one, I mentioned, about the workload-specific or you call it domain-specific process computing. General-purpose CPU, GPU, there's a good place for them. But right now the workload have changed so we call it the workload-specific, more application-related. And that's also driving not just the computing and also the, clearly, a lot of more exciting about the memory. There's some new innovation on memory. There's some new innovation on storage. And some of you have heard about the NVMe controller, disaggregation of the storage because of the massive, massive data that you need to be -- disaggregate the storage and network. And also the other parties, their high-speed connectivity, they're able to scale the connectivity speed that's required in the hyperscale. So all this are going to be driving a very strong design activity, and we are in the middle of it. We are well positioned to capture that. And that's why I think the -- from our point of view, the design activity is increased substantially. We are excited about supporting some of our customers to really embark on some of these opportunities."

We are very delighted in that strategic partnership with that so that we're starting to move into that space. And that's about $3 billion market that we are excited about. The next thing that we're looking at is the whole, we call it, the system analysis space, and that's about $4.5 billion. And then it's about time to have some innovation solution, able to provide an account, enabled and scalable, and then using our strength to apply because as you'll recall, we also have the PCB business and also the 3D technology so that we can really apply that into this 3D solver, and that is just the beginning on the EM, electromagnetics field simulation area. And then stay tuned. We have continued the development and investing in this space. And it's a big market, $4.5 billion. And customers love it. And so far, the initial feedback from our potential customers, and we highlight, too, that I endorse our approach, and then they see the benefit of the performance, and we're excited about it. And then finally, we're going to use that through the pervasive intelligence, using the AI and machine learning, and basically we're going to apply into, we call it, the inside and outside. Inside basically using AI/machine learning to drive performance improvement, productivity and performance improvement across all our product lines in term of EDA tools.

Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the first quarter of 2019, delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with broad-based strength across our product lines.
As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the year, and John will provide more details shortly. While there's some uncertainty in the overall macro environment, we are confident about the multiple trends that have continued to drive strong design activity. In addition to technology trends, like AI and 5G, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicon, new silicon startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industry -- industrial applications.
Our business is mission-critical to silicon development which is cornerstone of all design activity. As we have stated, our System Design Enablement, or SDE strategy, drives growth in our core EDA and IP business; broadens our reach in system companies and targeted verticals; and guides our expansion into newer, adjacent areas.
We executed well on this strategy. And today, I want to highlight its next phase which we're calling intelligent system design. The foundation of this strategy continues to be delivering design excellence via our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains; and pervasive intelligence, where we will apply AI and our algorithm know-how to our core business and specific verticals.
Our intelligent system design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimated $30 billion over the next 5 years. To highlight some of this -- some of our recent activities in the system innovation space, in Q1, we announced a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software which opens new opportunities in the estimated more than $3 billion embedded system, safety and security space. And earlier this month, we entered the system analysis market, an estimated $4.5 billion total addressable market opportunity, by introducing our first product, Clarity 3D Solver, a next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulation. Clarity is a true 3D solver which delivers up to 10x faster simulation performance while virtually unlimited capacity without compromising accuracy.
Clarity used state of art, distributed, multiprocessing technology, making it uniquely optimized for the cloud and on-premise distributed computing and has been endorsed by Teradyne and HiSilicon.
Turning to our core business. Our digital and signoff business achieved 12% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong adoption by new customers and proliferation of -- by existing customers at advanced nodes. Today, more than 100 7-nanometer designs have taped out using our digital solution, and multiple 5-nanometer designs are underway using our solution as well.
Our hardware-assisted verification products, an important part of our Verification Suite, had another good quarter. Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 2 new customers that are doing machine learning designs including SambaNova Systems.
We also have 13 repeat orders including 3 significant expansions, one of which was at Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company. Our Protium S1 prototyping platform, which enables early software development also added 2 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. Palladium cloud continued its steady momentum and now has more than 10 customers, several of which have made repeat orders.
Our IP business also showed double-digit growth year-over-year. Tensilica continue to win sockets for machine learning, vision and audio applications in the automotive, consumer and surveillance segments, adding 8 new customers in the quarter.
In the Design IP space, our new 112-gig long-reach SerDes IP was adopted by a marquee semiconductor company, and we launched the industry first complete silicon-proven LPDDR5 silicon. As I had said earlier, our strategy broaden our reach in system companies and targeted verticals. One of our most successful targeted verticals is aerospace and defense where we recently announced that we are working with Northrop Grumman, where our EDA IP solutions has supported a shortened product development cycle and advanced nodes tapeouts.
Lastly, I want to highlight the new Cadence CloudBurst platform, the latest addition to our cloud portfolio which extends our cloud leadership in EDA and provides customer with very compelling productivity, flexibility and scalability benefits. CloudBurst enables hybrid cloud environment and is ideal for serving peak demand. It provides fast and easy access to preinstall Cadence Design tools in either AWS or Azure cloud environment. It was used by Barefoot Networks to achieve a 10x productivity improvement running Cadence Tempus Timing Signoff Solution on their 7-nanometer networking chips.
With that, I want to turn over the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

Cadence achieved broad-based growth across all lines of our business during Q1, with demand for hardware and IP exceeding our original expectations. Revenue, operating margin and cash from operations were all strong in Q1, and as hardware and IP have become a larger part of our overall business, our recurring revenue mix percentage is now in the high 80s.
Now let's go through the key results for the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $577 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32%; GAAP EPS was $0.43, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, cash totaled $539 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $400 million. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $185 million. DSOs were 42 days. And during Q1, we repurchased $81 million of Cadence shares.
Now we will provide our updated guidance. For Q2, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $575 million to $585 million; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.34 to $0.36; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is as follows: revenue in the range of $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.47; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.12; operating cash flow in the range of $665 million to $705 million; and for the year, we expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in Q1. We achieved strong operating results highlighted by 11% year-over-year revenue growth; 32% operating margin on a non-GAAP basis; and the generation of $185 million of operating cash in the quarter.
And looking at our revised outlook for the year, I'm pleased to see improvements in operating income consistently flowing through to cash as illustrated by the increase in our operating cash flow guidance for the year. We'd like to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for a solid start to 2019, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.

They're something that I'm very passionate about. And -- because we are moving into, I call it, big data environment. It's all about data and data analytics. So in a way, driving a lot of new requirements for the semiconductor. So one, I mentioned, about the workload-specific or you call it domain-specific process computing. General-purpose CPU, GPU, there's a good place for them. But right now the workload have changed so we call it the workload-specific, more application-related. And that's also driving not just the computing and also the, clearly, a lot of more exciting about the memory. There's some new innovation on memory. There's some new innovation on storage. And some of you have heard about the NVMe controller, disaggregation of the storage because of the massive, massive data that you need to be -- disaggregate the storage and network. And also the other parties, their high-speed connectivity, they're able to scale the connectivity speed that's required in the hyperscale. So all this are going to be driving a very strong design activity, and we are in the middle of it. We are well positioned to capture that. And that's why I think the -- from our point of view, the design activity is increased substantially. We are excited about supporting some of our customers to really embark on some of these opportunities."

We are moving on 3-nanometer. And so I think we're excited about continuing to drive that. And then we move on to the system innovation. That is moving to the system domains. And as I mentioned earlier, really using our -- and we've been to a soul searching, we found that our core competency, in the computational software and then the -- and the digital implementation that we have, and it can be scaled into the system level. And that's why we are excited I think to embark on that into this, I call it, the first mover is -- basically is the embedded system. Safety and security space, we've been here. We are very delighted in that strategic partnership with that so that we're starting to move into that space. And that's about $3 billion market that we are excited about. The next thing that we're looking at is the whole, we call it, the system analysis space, and that's about $4.5 billion. And then it's about time to have some innovation solution, able to provide an account, enabled and scalable, and then using our strength to apply because as you'll recall, we also have the PCB business and also the 3D technology so that we can really apply that into this 3D solver, and that is just the beginning on the EM, electromagnetics field simulation area. And then stay tuned. We have continued the development and investing in this space. And it's a big market, $4.5 billion. And customers love it. And so far, the initial feedback from our potential customers, and we highlight, too, that I endorse our approach, and then they see the benefit of the performance, and we're excited about it. And then finally, we're going to use that through the pervasive intelligence, using the AI and machine learning, and basically we're going to apply into, we call it, the inside and outside. Inside basically using AI/machine learning to drive performance improvement, productivity and performance improvement across all our product lines in term of EDA tools. And we already see significant improvement on that. And then finally, we're also working with our leading customer using AI to optimize their flow and methodology so that the customer can really drive the performance like machine learning, deep learning and other applications.

Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our",879,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our business, we are raising our outlook for the year. John will provide more details shortly.
While there's an ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we remain confident about the multiple long-term trends that continue to drive strong design activity. Driven by trends such as artificial intelligence, or AI, 5G, autonomous driving and IoT, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicone, new silicone start ups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industrial applications.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers, while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimate $30 billion over the next 5 years. The foundation of the strategy is designed excellence, which is comprised of our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: the first one is system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains with products like Clarity. Our new 3D EM solver that was launched last quarter. Clarity has received considerable customer interest with numerous evaluation underway; and second new area is pervasive intelligence, where we are beginning to apply AI and our algorithmic knowledge to our core business and specific verticals.
Now let us turn to our quarterly highlights for our core business. Our innovation engine continue to deliver as we introduced 4 significantly new in the quarter. We grew revenue in digital and signoff by double digit year-over-year through both ongoing proliferation with market-shaping customers and adoption by new customers at advanced nodes. 
Samsung Austin R&D Center, a leader in high-performance design, has selected Cadence digital implementation solution for a next-generation high-end mobile CPU codesign. Cadence state of art, Innovus-based floor delivered the best quality of results for the design, enable Samsung Austim R&D center to meet its advanced process node objectives. 
Innovium, a leading provider of data center switching solutions, adopted Innovus for its highly scalable Teradyne Internet switch design. There were more than 40 tapeouts at 7-nanometer and below using our full digital flow in the first half of 2019. And Innovus, our digital implementation solutions, has over 80 active customers for 7-nanometer and below designs, including 10 at 5-nanometer.
Next, I want to discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification solutions, [indiscernible] revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Our hardware-assisted verification products, which are an integrated part of our Verification Suite, have done another good quarter. With the addition of Protium X1, we also provide a comprehensive solutions across IP and SoC verification, hardware/software regressions, system validation and earlier software development. 
Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 6 new customers and had 9 repeat orders. Habana Lab, a leading AI processor startup, say that Palladium was instrumental for the development of Gaudi, the industry first AI training processor that natively integrate ethernet and RD&E and for their Goya inferencing chip.
Fungible, a pioneer in data-centric computing, use a combination of Palladium Z1 and Protium S1 systems in the development of the RDPU summary of products. The DPU is a new type of microprocessor that will revolutionize the performance, reliability and economics of data center at all scales.
We introduced the Protium X1 Enterprise Prototyping Platform, which is the first data center-optimized FPGA-based prototyping system and provide multi-megahertz speed for 1 billion gate designs, accelerating earlier software development and hardware/software convergence. Customer reception of Protium S1 has been very positive with earlier adoption from some market-shaping customers, including NVIDIA.
Protium S1 and X1 also added 3 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. We also delivered the smart JasperGold formal verification platform that delivers an average of 2x fast approves out of box and 5x better regression runs, leveraging new machine learning-enabled smart proof technology. STMicro has been able to significantly boost its verification productivity with smart JasperGold.
Custom/analog grew a strong 11% year-over-year. In the quarter, we introduced an important new product Spectre X simulator which is next-generation massively parallel subject simulator designs to provide up to 10x performance gain, while solving 5x larger designs. And while maintaining the golden accuracy, customer expect from 25 years of specter industry leadership in analog, mixed-signal and RF applications. Spectre X was endorsed by MediaTek, Mellanox, Renesas and Silicon Works.
Now let me make a few comments on the geopolitical situation. We have, and we will continue, to comply with the United States Department of Commerce export control regulations. The situation is fluid and we will continue to closely monitoring it. While there is some ongoing uncertainty, thanks to our strategy, continued innovation and operational execution, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities arise from the longer-term trend, driving strong design activity. While we do not provide details about a specific customer, I do want to emphasize that we have a very broad, diversified and global customer base.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect",434,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect on May 16 and June 24, in respect to certain customers, remain in place today. We are aware that this is a very fluid situation, so for the purpose of providing guidance for the second half of 2019, we've assumed that these current export limitation remain in effect for the remainder of the year.
Now let me walk you through the key results for Q2, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. 
Next turning to the balance sheets and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $633 million while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $246 million. DSOs were 38 days. And during Q2, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q3, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $570 million to $580 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.52. Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: revenue in the range of $2.315 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.44 to $1.50; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.11 to $2.17; operating cash flow in the range of $680 million to $720 million; and for the year, we continue to expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our execution so far this year. We are living in uncertain times and I am proud of how we are adapting to a fluid environment. Our improved outlook speaks to the diversification of our customer base, the underlying strength of demand for our technology and solutions and the continued focus of our employees throughout the company on achieving our key financial metrics.
I would like to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the second half of 2019.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines.

Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our business, we are raising our outlook for the year. John will provide more details shortly.
While there's an ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we remain confident about the multiple long-term trends that continue to drive strong design activity. Driven by trends such as artificial intelligence, or AI, 5G, autonomous driving and IoT, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicone, new silicone startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industrial applications.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimate $30 billion over the next 5 years. The foundation of the strategy is designed excellence, which is comprised of our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: the first one is system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains with products like Clarity, our new 3D EM solver that was launched last quarter. Clarity has received considerable customer interest with numerous evaluation underway. And second new area is pervasive intelligence, where we are beginning to apply AI and our algorithmic knowledge to our core business and specific verticals.
Now let us turn to our quarterly highlights for our core business. Our innovation engine continued to deliver as we introduced 4 significantly new products in the quarter. We grew revenue in digital and signoff by double digit year-over-year through both ongoing proliferation with market-shaping customers and adoption by new customers at advanced nodes. 
Samsung Austin R&D Center, a leader in high-performance design, has selected Cadence digital implementation solution for a next-generation high-end mobile CPU codesign. Cadence's state-of-art, Innovus-based floor delivered the best quality of results for the design, enabled Samsung Austin R&D Center to meet its advanced process node objectives. 
Innovium, a leading provider of innovative data center switching solutions, adopted Innovus for its highly scalable Teradyne -- TERALYNX ethernet switch design. There were more than 40 tapeouts at 7-nanometer and below using our full digital flow in the first half of 2019. And Innovus, our digital implementation solutions, has over 80 active customers for 7-nanometer and below designs, including 10 at 5-nanometer.
Next, I want to discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification solutions, for which revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Our hardware-assisted verification products, which are an integrated part of our Verification Suite, had done another good quarter. With the addition of Protium X1, we also provide a comprehensive solutions across IP and SoC verification, hardware/software regressions, system validation and earlier software development. 
Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 6 new customers and had 9 repeat orders. Habana Labs, a leading AI processor startup, say that Palladium was instrumental for the development of Gaudi, the industry first AI training processor that natively integrate ethernet and RD&E and for their Goya inferencing chip.
Fungible, a pioneer in data-centric computing, used a combination of Palladium Z1 and Protium S1 systems in the development of their DPU summary of products. The DPU is a new type of microprocessor that will revolutionize the performance, reliability and economics of data center at all scales.
We introduced the Protium X1 Enterprise Prototyping Platform, which is the first data center-optimized FPGA-based prototyping system and provides multi-megahertz speed for 1 billion-gig designs, accelerating earlier software development and hardware/software convergence. Customer reception of Protium X1 has been very positive with earlier adoption from some market-shaping customers, including NVIDIA.
Protium S1 and X1 also added 3 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. We also delivered the smart JasperGold Formal Verification Platform that delivers an average of 2x faster proofs out of box and 5x faster regression runs, leveraging new machine learning-enabled smart proof technology. STMicro has been able to significantly boost its verification productivity with smart JasperGold.
Custom/analog grew a strong 11% year-over-year. In the quarter, we introduced an important new product Spectre X Simulator which is next-generation massively parallel circuit simulator designed to provide up to 10x performance gain while solving 5x larger designs, and while maintaining the golden accuracy customer expect from 25 years of Spectre industry leadership in analog, mixed-signal and RF applications. Spectre X was endorsed by MediaTek, Mellanox, Renesas and Silicon Works.
Now let me make a few comments on the geopolitical situation. We have, and we will continue, to comply with the United States Department of Commerce export control regulations. The situation is fluid, and we will continue to closely monitor it. While there is an ongoing uncertainty, thanks to our strategy, continued innovation and operational execution, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities arise from the longer-term trends, driving strong design activity. 
While we do not provide details about any specific customer, I do want to emphasize that we have a very broad, diversified and global customer base.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect on May 16 and June 24 in respect to certain customers remain in place today. We are aware that this is a very fluid situation, so for the purpose of providing guidance for the second half of 2019, we've assumed that these current export limitation remain in effect for the remainder of the year. Now let me walk you through the key results for Q2, beginning with the P&L. 
Total revenue was $580 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. 
Next turning to the balance sheets and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $633 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $246 million. DSOs were 38 days, and during Q2, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q3, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $570 million to $580 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.52. 
Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: revenue in the range of $2.315 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.44 to $1.50; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.11 to $2.17; operating cash flow in the range of $680 million to $720 million; and for the year, we continue to expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our execution so far this year. We are living in uncertain times and I am proud of how we are adapting to a fluid environment. Our improved outlook speaks to the diversification of our customer base, the underlying strength of demand for our technology and solutions and the continued focus of our employees throughout the company on achieving our key financial metrics.
I would like to thank our customers, partners, and of course, our employees. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the second half of 2019.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

So I imagine you've been able to onboard some, but can you talk about how you're doing in terms of bringing those kind of people on? And then lastly, for John, you've talked for the last number of years about deal quality, price optimization and so forth. When you think about your base of customer contracts in cohort terms or aging of the cohort of the contracts, how do you think you have done so far in terms of optimizing the basic contracts? Or how much is left to be done in terms of outstanding contracts or at renewals you can optimize?"

Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of o",883,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 
Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our business, we are raising our outlook for the year. John will provide more details shortly.
While there's an ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we remain confident about the multiple long-term trends that continue to drive strong design activity. Driven by trends such as artificial intelligence, or AI, 5G, autonomous driving and IoT, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicone, new silicone startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industrial applications.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimate $30 billion over the next 5 years. The foundation of the strategy is designed excellence, which is comprised of our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: the first one is system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains with products like Clarity, our new 3D EM solver that was launched last quarter. Clarity has received considerable customer interest with numerous evaluations underway. And second new area is pervasive intelligence, where we are beginning to apply AI and our algorithmic knowledge to our core business and specific verticals.
Now let us turn to our quarterly highlights for our core business. Our innovation engine continued to deliver as we introduced 4 significant new products in the quarter. We grew revenue in digital and signoff by double digit year-over-year through both ongoing proliferation with market-shaping customers and adoption by new customers at advanced nodes. 
Samsung Austin R&D Center, a leader in high-performance design, has selected Cadence digital implementation solution for a next-generation high-end mobile CPU codesign. Cadence's state-of-art, Innovus-based floor delivered the best quality of results for their design, enabled Samsung Austin R&D Center to meet its advanced process node objectives. 
Innovium, a leading provider of innovative data center switching solutions, adopted Innovus for its highly scalable Teradyne -- TERALYNX ethernet switch design. There were more than 40 tapeouts at 7-nanometer and below using our full digital flow in the first half of 2019. And Innovus, our digital implementation solutions, has over 80 active customers for 7-nanometer and below designs, including 10 at 5-nanometer.
Next, I want to discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification solutions, for which revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Our hardware-assisted verification products, which are an integrated part of our Verification Suite, had done another good quarter. With the addition of Protium X1, we also provide a comprehensive solutions across IP and SoC verification, hardware/software regressions, system validation and earlier software development. 
Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 6 new customers and had 9 repeat orders. Habana Labs, a leading AI processor startup, say that Palladium was instrumental for the development of Gaudi, the industry first AI training processor that natively integrate ethernet and RDMA and for their Goya inferencing chip.
Fungible, a pioneer in data-centric computing, used a combination of Palladium Z1 and Protium S1 systems in the development of their DPU summary of products. The DPU is a new type of microprocessor that will revolutionize the performance, reliability and economics of data center at all scales.
We introduced the Protium X1 Enterprise Prototyping Platform, which is the first data center-optimized FPGA-based prototyping system and provides multi-megahertz speed for 1 [ billion-gig ] designs, accelerating earlier software development and hardware/software convergence. Customer reception of Protium X1 has been very positive with earlier adoption from some market-shaping customers, including NVIDIA.
Protium S1 and X1 also added 3 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. We also delivered the smart JasperGold Formal Verification Platform that delivers an average of 2x faster proofs out of box and 5x faster regression runs  by leveraging new machine learning-enabled smart proof technology. STMicro has been able to significantly boost its verification productivity with smart JasperGold.
Custom/analog grew a strong 11% year-over-year. In the quarter, we introduced an important new product Spectre X Simulator which is next-generation massively parallel circuit simulator designed to provide up to 10x performance gain while solving 5x larger designs, and while maintaining the golden accuracy customer expect from 25 years of Spectre industry leadership in analog, mixed-signal and RF applications. Spectre X was endorsed by MediaTek, Mellanox, Renesas and Silicon Works.
Now let me make a few comments on the geopolitical situation. We have, and we will continue, to comply with the United States Department of Commerce export control regulations. The situation is fluid, and we will continue to closely monitor it. While there is an ongoing uncertainty, thanks to our strategy, continued innovation and operational execution, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities arise from the longer-term trends, driving strong design activity. 
While we do not provide details about any specific customer, I do want to emphasize that we have a very broad, diversified and global customer base.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect on May 16 and June 24 in respect to certain customers remain in place today. We are aware that this is a very fluid situation, so for the purpose of providing guidance for the second half of 2019, we've assumed that these current export limitations remain in effect for the remainder of the year. Now let me walk you through the key results for Q2, beginning with the P&L. 
Total revenue was $580 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. 
Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $633 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $246 million. DSOs were 38 days, and during Q2, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q3, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $570 million to $580 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.52. 
Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: revenue in the range of $2.315 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.44 to $1.50; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.11 to $2.17; operating cash flow in the range of $680 million to $720 million; and for the year, we continue to expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our execution so far this year. We are living in uncertain times and I am proud of how we are adapting to a fluid environment. Our improved outlook speaks to the diversification of our customer base, the underlying strength of demand for our technology and solutions and the continued focus of our employees throughout the company on achieving our key financial metrics.
I would like to thank our customers, partners, and of course, our employees. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the second half of 2019.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

We're excited about that whole double vision and AI performance for automotive AR, VR, mobile and civilian applications, and so we just put [ out a ] release on that. And we have a couple of design wins in the data center, mobile and automotive application. And then the other part we like a lot is this 30 -- high-speed 30, 112 gig 30 at 7-nanometer. And we have very strong customer demands, and we're working very intensively with them. 
So overall, we like the IP business, and we continue to build that as part of our whole, we call it the design excellence. Including EDA and IP, that is our strategy. 
In terms of the PCB in the interconnect side, also a very good, solid business. And clearly, the whole system interconnect and system analysis side, and we are double-digit growth in that area. And so clearly, the whole system analysis, that will increase $4.5 billion TAM market. And then our Clarity 3D Solver, very well received by customer. We have numerous evaluations and strong customer engagement and interest. So all in all, I think we are pretty solid on that."

Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our",883,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Cadence achieved strong operating results for the second quarter of 2019, delivering 12% year-over-year revenue growth on broad-based strength across our product lines. Based on the strength of our business, we are raising our outlook for the year. John will provide more details shortly.
While there's an ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we remain confident about the multiple long-term trends that continue to drive strong design activity. Driven by trends such as artificial intelligence, or AI, 5G, autonomous driving and IoT, design activity is being fueled by workload-specific computing, system companies building custom silicone, new silicone startups and digital transformation of industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other industrial applications.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy will enable us to provide more capabilities and value to our customers while also expanding our current total addressable market from about $10 billion to estimate $30 billion over the next 5 years. The foundation of the strategy is designed excellence, which is comprised of our core EDA and IP business. In addition, we are building upon our core competency in computational software to expand into 2 new areas: the first one is system innovation, where we are expanding into new system domains with products like Clarity, our new 3D EM solver that was launched last quarter. Clarity has received considerable customer interest with numerous evaluations underway. And second new area is pervasive intelligence, where we are beginning to apply AI and our algorithmic knowledge to our core business and specific verticals.
Now let us turn to our quarterly highlights for our core business. Our innovation engine continued to deliver as we introduced 4 significant new products in the quarter. We grew revenue in digital and signoff by double digit year-over-year through both ongoing proliferation with market-shaping customers and adoption by new customers at advanced nodes. 
Samsung Austin R&D Center, a leader in high-performance design, has selected Cadence digital implementation solution for a next-generation high-end mobile CPU codesign. Cadence's state-of-art, Innovus-based floor delivered the best quality of results for their design, enabled Samsung Austin R&D Center to meet its advanced process node objectives. 
Innovium, a leading provider of innovative data center switching solutions, adopted Innovus for its highly scalable Teradyne -- TERALYNX Ethernet switch design. There were more than 40 tapeouts at 7-nanometer and below using our full digital flow in the first half of 2019. And Innovus, our digital implementation solutions, has over 80 active customers for 7-nanometer and below designs, including 10 at 5-nanometer.
Next, I want to discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification solutions, for which revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Our hardware-assisted verification products, which are an integrated part of our Verification Suite, had done another good quarter. With the addition of Protium X1, we also provide a comprehensive solutions across IP and SoC verification, hardware/software regressions, system validation and earlier software development. 
Palladium Z1, our flagship emulation platform, added 6 new customers and had 9 repeat orders. Habana Labs, a leading AI processor startup, say that Palladium was instrumental for the development of Gaudi, the industry first AI training processor that natively integrate Ethernet and RDMA and for their Goya inferencing chip.
Fungible, a pioneer in data-centric computing, used a combination of Palladium Z1 and Protium S1 systems in the development of their DPU summary of products. The DPU is a new type of microprocessor that will revolutionize the performance, reliability and economics of data center at all scales.
We introduced the Protium X1 Enterprise Prototyping Platform, which is the first data center-optimized FPGA-based prototyping system and provides multi-megahertz speed for 1 [ billion-gig ] designs, accelerating earlier software development and hardware/software convergence. Customer reception of Protium X1 has been very positive with earlier adoption from some market-shaping customers, including NVIDIA.
Protium S1 and X1 also added 3 new customers and received 7 repeat orders. We also delivered the smart JasperGold Formal Verification Platform that delivers an average of 2x faster proofs out of box and 5x faster regression runs by leveraging new machine learning-enabled smart proof technology. STMicro has been able to significantly boost its verification productivity with smart JasperGold.
Custom/analog grew a strong 11% year-over-year. In the quarter, we introduced an important new product Spectre X Simulator which is next-generation massively parallel circuit simulator designed to provide up to 10x performance gain while solving 5x larger designs, and while maintaining the golden accuracy customer expect from 25 years of Spectre industry leadership in analog, mixed-signal and RF applications. Spectre X was endorsed by MediaTek, Mellanox, Renesas and Silicon Works.
Now let me make a few comments on the geopolitical situation. We have, and we will continue, to comply with the United States Department of Commerce export control regulations. The situation is fluid, and we will continue to closely monitor it. While there is an ongoing uncertainty, thanks to our strategy, continued innovation and operational execution, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities arise from the longer-term trends, driving strong design activity. While we do not provide details about any specific customer, I do want to emphasize that we have a very broad, diversified and global customer base.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect",434,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our results for Q2 and our updated outlook for fiscal 2019. Q2 was a little unusual due to the export limitations that were imposed during the quarter. The export limitations that took effect on May 16 and June 24 in respect to certain customers remain in place today. We are aware that this is a very fluid situation, so for the purpose of providing guidance for the second half of 2019, we've assumed that these current export limitations remain in effect for the remainder of the year. Now let me walk you through the key results for Q2, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. 
Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $633 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $246 million. DSOs were 38 days, and during Q2, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q3, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $570 million to $580 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.52. 
Our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: revenue in the range of $2.315 billion to $2.335 billion; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.44 to $1.50; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.11 to $2.17; operating cash flow in the range of $680 million to $720 million; and for the year, we continue to expect to use approximately 50% of free cash flow to repurchase Cadence stock. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I am pleased with our execution so far this year. We are living in uncertain times and I am proud of how we are adapting to a fluid environment. Our improved outlook speaks to the diversification of our customer base, the underlying strength of demand for our technology and solutions and the continued focus of our employees throughout the company on achieving our key financial metrics.
I would like to thank our customers, partners, and of course, our employees. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the second half of 2019.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Based on our strong execution and strength of our technology and business, we are, again, raising our outlook for the year. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing trade situations with China, our outlook assume current export limitations remain in place for the rest of the year. John will provide more detail on our outlook shortly. 
While global economy and geopolitical uncertainty continues, long-term trends such as AI, 5G, Cloud and IoT continues to drive strong design activity. The most total Minsk specific computing and system companies building custom silicone as well as the host of innovative silicon startups are all pushing the technology envelope and driving the need for high-performance, low-power computing, high bandwidth connectivity and high density storage. 
Our Intelligent System Design strategy focus or position us well to maximize the resulting opportunities through building out our portfolio and providing more capabilities and value to our customers. The foundation of our strategy is the design excellence segment, which comprises of our core EDA and IP business. I will now provide some of the key quarterly highlights in this area. 
A key element of our approach has been to closely collaborate with our ecosystem partners and focus on market-shaping customers. In Q3, we deepen our partnership with Samsung through a comprehensive agreement across our digital, custom and vertification product portfolio. Earlier this year, we had reported a breakthrough wide-ranging win with marquee U.S. semiconductor company. I'm particularly pleased that we augmented the partnership with our largest ever IP order that included our Tensilica process of family and our design IP portfolio, including ultra high-speed SerDes. 
At its recent open innovation event, TMC recognized Cadence with 4 partners of the year awards, including an award for joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure, and 1 for joint delivery of cloud-based productivity solution. Our Cadence Cloud portfolio has great momentum with over 50 customers using our solution in the cloud. Cadence Cloud ready products and close collaboration with our cloud infrastructure and foundry partners are enabling our customers to realize meaningful scalability, performance and flexibility benefits from using the cloud. 
Our CloudBurst model is used for hybrid cloud infrastructures where customer wants to augment their on-premise infrastructure with capacity from the public cloud to address [indiscernible] load. Continuing strong proliferation of our digital and sign-up solutions, especially with market-shaping customers at the most advanced nodes, have driven gains and double-digit year-to-date revenue growth. 
In addition to numerous 7-nanometer tapeouts, there are more than 15 customer engagements at 5 and 3-nanometer using our digital flow. MediaTek has deployed our digital full flow in production for their 7-nanometer design. At Mellanox, leading -- leader in technology, data and connectivity solutions Innovus replaced the incumbent solution for all of their production 7-nanometer designs. We also had a digital full flow competitive win for 7-nanometer design with a leading Japanese imaging company. use Cadence digital full flow, which is based on common engines and includes Innovus, campus and to achieve the best quality of results and the fastest convergent of their highly innovative and completely integrated first digital automotive radar on-chip. 
Next I will discuss highlights of our system design and verification solutions. Our Palladium Z1 emulator and the recently introduced Protium X1 prototyping platform now provides a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, hardware, software regression and earlier software development. Growing system design complexity and the high cost of failure continues to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z1. In Q3 , the Z1 added 8 new customers and had key -- and have 8 key expansions. Routing off our hardware family is the Protium X1, which is a perfect complement to our Palladium Z1. I'm excited by the strong customer interest in Protium X1. 
A global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and Protium X1 as well, making it one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence. 
We had several full verification Suite wins in Q3, including a major customer in Asia and an automotive semiconductor company in EMEA. In IP, our focus strategy and strong portfolio have enabled us to benefit from the continuing IP outsourcing trend. In Q3, we had our best ever quarter for IP with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 20%. It was an especially strong quarter for our Tensilica products with additional wins in audio, imaging, computer vision and machine learning. 
In system innovation segments of our Intelligent System Design strategy, we introduced the thermal server, which joins the Clarity 3D EM solver in a growing suite of our system analysis products. Celsius is a industry-first complete electrode thermal co-simulation solution for the electronic system from IC to system or to physical and closures. Based on the proven massively parallel architecture that delivers up to 10x faster performance with full accuracy, Celsius enables design teams to mitigate thermal issues at an early stage, thereby reducing system development iterations. WASH, and ARM have both endorsed this exciting new products and we're in the midst of earlier discussion with several other customers. Clarity, which was announced earlier this year continue its strong momentum with 4 competitive wins during the quarter, and more than 30 active customer engagements underway. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q3. As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business we are increasing our outlook",429,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q3. As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2019. 
Before we get into the Q3 results, I would like to take a moment and talk about the ongoing trade uncertainties. With more companies recently added to the entity list, the situation remains fluid and we will continue to closely monitor it. For the purpose of providing guidance for 2019, we've assumed that the current export limitations remain in effect and the entity list remains unchanged for the remainder of the year. 
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%. GAAP EPS was $0.36 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54. 
Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $655 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q3 was $139 million. DSOs were 43 days, and during Q3, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares. 
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q4, we expect the following: Revenue in the range of $590 million to $600 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.35; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54; and we expect to repurchase $75 million of Cadence shares. As a result, our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: Revenue in the range of $2.327 billion to $2.337 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.52; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.18 to $2.20; and operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $740 million. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in an uncertain environment. Our strong dependable results reflect the broad diversity of our global cost base. We remain focused on driving growth in our core business highlighted by the proliferation of our digital full flow and we continue to invest in growth opportunities with market-shaping customers and new product areas. 
In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners, and of course, our employees for their continued support. And with that operator, we'll now take questions."

And more specifically, how do you dedicated resources to those customers in terms of commitments, and so forth? And then a growth question. We've seen a number of categories in EDA have extended periods of consecutive growth. For example, the industry data, and of course, your numbers. The custom category has had more than 30 consecutive trailing 12-month periods of growth, IC implementation more than 16, PCB 12. So that's all very good, of course, but historically, EDA growth cycles for particular category don't lasts for more than 3 to 4 years, but we've now seen multiple categories that are meeting or beating historical periods of consistent growth. So which I think in terms of sustainability or what's different now vis-à-vis the different categories?"

So first of all, about market-shaping customer, the definition is that they're clearly the leaders in their sector. And so they're the most demanding customer, but because they're leader, they are driving the innovation, they're driving the performance. And we want to be the partners for them, the trusted partner to enable their invasion, to continue their leadership in the marketplace in the various different vertical market or the platform that they create, we want to be a partner for them. And that is how we define the market-shaping customer. In terms of growth, as I mentioned, you can see my passion. Clearly in a way we are not creating the changes, we are right with the wave. The beauty part in this particular junction of the industry, there's a 5 different wave driving the growth and they're changing the landscape of the requirement. As I just mentioned, 1 example, is AI and now we're moving into, I call it the data centric economy. It's all about data. And then today's only 2% of the data being analyzed and being utilized. So there's a humongous opportunity. And then this is applying to across all the different vertical and it's really driving the change to the memory, driving the change of the storage, driving the domain specific processor, so in a way it's workload specific, depending on a different workload, different market, require different rather than just CPU/GPU or FPGA, there's a new class of workload that require different type of processor. And that we're also driving the memory, the storage, the infrastructure in terms of able to cope with the data, massive, massive, exposing of data. And so all this is going to require new innovation in order to support that like for example, the programmability, the scale of the storage and network and then scale out the top of the rack all the way top of in terms of the infrastructure 12.8 terabyte per second to 51.2 terabytes per second switch. And all the high-speed interconnecting and that's why the 30 is so important for high-speed. And that's why Cadence bought it and then we're going to triple down on it to really drive the requirement that the hyperscale and the big infrastructure player need that. So I think that's going to be driving a lot of new innovation in semiconductor side and we are learning and we're trying to be the trusted partner to fulfill some of this requirements. And that's why I mentioned earlier, the design activity increased a lot. And we're excited about it and is just the beginning of it."

I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth.

I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Based on our strong execution and strength of our technology and business, we are, again, raising our outlook for the year. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing trade situations with China, our outlook assume current export limitations remain in place for the rest of the year. John will provide more detail on our outlook shortly.
While global economy and geopolitical uncertainty continues, long-term trends such as AI, 5G, cloud and IoT continues to drive strong design activity. The move to domain-specific computing and system companies building custom silicon as well as a host of innovative silicon startups are all pushing the technology envelope and driving the need for high-performance, low-power computing, high-bandwidth connectivity and high-density storage.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy focus position us well to maximize the resulting opportunities through building out our portfolio and providing more capabilities and value to our customers. The foundation of our strategy is the design excellence segment, which comprised of our core EDA and IP business. I will now provide some of the key quarterly highlights in this area.
A key element of our approach has been to closely collaborate with our ecosystem partners and focus on market-shaping customers. In Q3, we deepened our partnership with Samsung through a comprehensive agreement across our digital, custom and verification product portfolio. Early this year, we had reported a breakthrough wide-ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company. I am particularly pleased that we augmented their partnership with our largest-ever IP order that included our Tensilica processor family and our design IP portfolio, including ultra high-speed SerDes.
At its recent open innovation platform event, TSMC recognized Cadence with 4 Partners of the Year Awards, including an award for joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure, and 1 for joint delivery of cloud-based productivity solution. Our Cadence Cloud portfolio has great momentum with over 50 customers using our solution in the cloud. Cadence Cloud ready products in close collaboration with our cloud infrastructure and foundry partners are enabling our customers to realize meaningful scalability, performance and flexibility benefits from using the cloud.
Our CloudBurst model is used for hybrid cloud infrastructures where customers want to augment their on-premise infrastructure with vast capacity from the public cloud to address peak load. Continuing strong proliferation of our digital and sign-up solutions, especially with market-shaping customers at the most-advanced nodes have driven share gains and double-digit year-to-date revenue growth.
In addition to numerous 7-nanometer tapeouts, there are more than 15 customer engagements at 5- and 3-nanometer using our digital flow. MediaTek has deployed our digital full flow in production for their 7-nanometer design. At Mellanox, leading in -- leader in technology -- in data, connectivity solutions, Innovus replaced the incumbent solution for all of their production 7-nanometer design. We also had a digital full-flow competitive win for 7-nanometer design with a leading Japanese imaging company. Uhnder used Cadence's digital full flow, which is based on common engines and includes Genus, Innovus, Tempus and Pegasus to achieve the best quality of results and the fastest convergent of their highly innovative and completely integrated first digital automotive radar on-chip .
Next, I will discuss highlights of our system design and verification solutions. Our Palladium Z1 emulator and the recently introduced Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping platform now provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, hardware, software regressions and earlier software development. Growing system design complexity and the high cost of failure continues to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z1. In Q3 , the Z1 added 8 new customers and had key -- and have 8 key expansions. Rounding off our hardware family is the Protium X1, which is a perfect complement to our Palladium Z1. I'm excited by the strong customer interest in Protium X1. A global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and Protium X1 as well, making it one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence.
We had several full verification suite wins in Q3, including a major customer in Asia and an automotive semiconductor company in EMEA. In IP, our focused strategy and strong portfolio have enabled us to benefit from the continuing IP outsourcing trend. In Q3, we had our best-ever quarter for IP with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 20%. It was an especially strong quarter for our Tensilica products with additional wins in audio, imaging, computer vision and machine learning.
In system innovation segments of our Intelligent System Design strategy, we introduced the Celsius Thermal Solver, which joins the Clarity 3D EM Solver in the growing suite of our system analysis products. Celsius is a industry-first complete electrothermal co-simulation solution for the electronic system from ICs to system or to physical enclosures. Based on the proven, massively parallel architecture that delivers up to 10x faster performance with full accuracy, Celsius enables design teams to mitigate thermal issues at an earlier stage, thereby reducing system development iterations. Bosch and ARM have both endorsed this exciting new products, and we're in the midst of earlier discussion with several other customers. Clarity, which was announced earlier this year continue its strong momentum with 4 competitive wins during the quarter and more than 30 active customer engagements underway.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2019.
Before we get into the Q3 results, I would like to take a moment and talk about the ongoing trade uncertainties. With more companies recently added to the entity list, the situation remains fluid, and we will continue to closely monitor it. For the purpose of providing guidance for 2019, we've assumed that the current export limitations remain in effect and the entity list remains unchanged for the remainder of the year.
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%. GAAP EPS was $0.36 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $655 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q3 was $139 million. DSOs were 43 days, and during Q3, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q4, we expect the following results: Revenue in the range of $590 million to $600 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.35; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54; and we expect to repurchase $75 million of Cadence shares. As a result, our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: Revenue in the range of $2.327 billion to $2.337 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.52; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.18 to $2.20; and operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $740 million. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in an uncertain environment. Our strong dependable results reflect the broad diversity of our global customer base. We remain focused on driving growth in our core business highlighted by the proliferation of our digital full flow, and we continue to invest in growth opportunities with market-shaping customers and new product areas.
In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners, and of course, our employees for their continued support.
And with that operator, we'll now take questions."

First of all, I think we have our approach of the system analysis space and that something is really our core competence of computational software and that we can apply into this complex system analysis space. And then we have this 2 new product, initially we announced Clarity that is a 3D EM solver. We are delighted. We have 4 competitive wins and this is a very new product for us. And we have more than 30 active customer engagements going forward. And so we're excited about that. And meanwhile, we just announced our Celsius Thermal Solver. And again, back to that computational software strength that we have and we clearly demonstrate that up to 10x performance and customers are delighted to see our performance, specifically are Bosch and ARM, they both endorse our new products and we're in middle of earlier discussion. So it's still in a very early stage of our emerging into the system analysis, and more and more our customer love that because beside the EDA, beside the IP, they want to look at the total system solution, simulation, whether it fit the whole system, power, thermal envelopes. And something that we can really demonstrate and provide the best solution for the customer. So it's still very early. And in terms of our pricing, again, it's not part of our EDA, and so we do it differently and basically, close to the market competitive pricing, and -- but in a very early stage of winning and then, stay tune, over time, we will unfold and give you a progress update."

And as mentioned, in Q3, we are delighted to deepen our partnership with Samsung through comprehensive agreement across not just digital custom and also verification products. And then the Palladium Z1 had been doing great and the customer love it on the hardware emulation, but now we add the Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping that we can provide a comprehensive solutions across IP and SoC verification, especially for hardware, software regression and earlier software development. That combination using the same front-end software make it easier for the customer. And so I think we clearly see that in new customers and in key expansions, and so I think we are just delighted and very pleased Protium giving a lot of opportunity for us. And we also highlight a global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and add on the Protium X1 as well make us -- make that one as a larger 1 -- the largest hardware orders for Cadence.

AI is not just semiconductor, it's applied into all the different vertical industries. So the impact can be quite huge. And we're excited about this opportunity, the design activities increase a lot.

So most of the beat on the op margin side in Q3 was a result of gross margins. My expectation for Q4 is that we have a significant hardware pipeline heading into Q4. It was kind of similar. It reminds me of where we were this time last year. And last year, our gross margin tick down, I think, 200 basis points from Q3 to Q4. So we're expecting about 30%. And that's because you've got a combination of things happening, right? You've got Q3 and Q4, we're assuming that there is no change in export limitations right now.

We've seen a number of categories in EDA have extended periods of consecutive growth. For example, the industry data, and of course, your numbers, the custom category has had more than 30 consecutive trailing 12-month periods of growth, IC implementation more than 16, PCB 12. So that's all very good, of course, but historically, EDA growth cycles for particular categories don't last for more than 3 to 4 years, 3 to 4 years each. But we've now seen multiple categories that are meeting or beating historical periods of consistent growth. So what's your thinking in terms of sustainability or what's different now vis-à-vis the different categories?"

The definition is that they're clearly the leaders in their sector. And so they're the most-demanding customer, but because they are leader, they are driving the innovation, they're driving the performance. And we want to be the partners for them -- the trusted partner to enable their innovation, to continue their leadership in the marketplace in the various different vertical market or the platform that they create. We want them -- we want to be the partner for them. And that is how we define the market-shaping customer. 
In terms of growth, as I mentioned, you can see in my passion. Clearly, in a way we are not creating the changes, we are right with the wave. And the beauty part in this particular junction of the industry, there's a 5 different wave driving the growth and they're changing the landscape of the requirement. As I just mentioned, one example, is AI and now we're moving into, I call it, the data-centric economy. It's all about data. And then today only 2% of the data being analyzed and being utilized. So there's a humongous opportunity. And then this is applying to across all the different vertical and it's really driving the change to the memory, driving the change of the storage, driving the domain-specific processor. So in a way, it's workload-specific, depending on different workload, different market require different -- rather than just CPU/GPU or FPGA, there's a new class of workload that require different type of processor. And then we're also driving the memory, the storage, the infrastructure in terms of able to cope with the data, massive, massive explosion of data. And then so, all this is going to require new innovation in order to support that. Like, for example, the programmability, the scale of the storage and network and then scale of the top of the rack all the way to top on the spine in terms of the infrastructure, 12.8 terabyte per second to 51.2 terabytes per second switch. And all the high-speed interconnecting and that's why the SerDes is so important for high speed. And that's why Cadence bought it and then we're going to triple down on it to, to really drive the requirement that the hyperscale and the big infrastructure player need that. So I think this is going to be driving a lot of new innovation in semiconductor side, and we are learning and we're trying to be the trusted partner to fulfill some of this requirements. And that's why I mentioned earlier, the design activity increased a lot. And we're excited about it and it's just the beginning of it."

And also you have a lot of opportunity to fail because the different tool have different methodology. And so the customers starting to really focus on getting a full flow, the best -- I think it's very important. Our focus first of all is to have the best of breed through each product line, like the Innovus we mentioned earlier for place and route. Right now, it's a majority, over 70% of the customer are adopting it in the most advanced nodes. And then now we have the Genus come out, very strong and then Tempus come out and Pegasus. Customers are starting to see that not only the best of breed of product and also how to integrate them, how to optimize them and correlation among all the different flow that we've been talking about last few years. And so right now, we can not only have the best of breed for each product, now we can integrate, and that's why you're starting to hear that we mentioned a lot about digital full flow that our customers depend completely on us on the most advanced node in the 7 and 5 and 3 and that's the way we're going to continue to support the customer."

I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth. Based on our strong execution and strength",914,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth. 
Based on our strong execution and strength of our technology and business, we are, again, raising our outlook for the year. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing trade situations with China, our outlook assume current export limitations remain in place for the rest of the year. John will provide more detail on our outlook shortly.
While global economy and geopolitical uncertainty continues, long-term trends such as AI, 5G, cloud and IoT continues to drive strong design activity. The move to domain-specific computing and system companies building custom silicon as well as a host of innovative silicon startups are all pushing the technology envelope and driving the need for high-performance, low-power computing, high-bandwidth connectivity and high-density storage.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy focus position us well to maximize the resulting opportunities through building out our portfolio and providing more capabilities and value to our customers. The foundation of our strategy is the design excellence segment, which comprise of our core EDA and IP business. I will now provide some of the key quarterly highlights in this area.
A key element of our approach has been to closely collaborate with our ecosystem partners and focus on market-shaping customers. In Q3, we deepened our partnership with Samsung through a comprehensive agreement across our digital, custom and verification product portfolio. 
Early this year, we had reported a breakthrough wide-ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company. I am particularly pleased that we augmented that partnership with our largest-ever IP order that included our Tensilica processor family and our design IP portfolio, including ultra-high-speed SerDes.
At its recent open innovation platform event, TSMC recognized Cadence with 4 Partners of the Year Awards, including an award for joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure, and 1 for joint delivery of cloud-based productivity solution. 
Our Cadence Cloud portfolio has great momentum with over 50 customers using our solution in the cloud. Cadence Cloud-ready products in close collaboration with our cloud infrastructure and foundry partners are enabling our customers to realize meaningful scalability, performance and flexibility benefits from using the cloud.
Our CloudBurst model is used for hybrid cloud infrastructures where customers want to augment their on-premise infrastructure with vast capacity from the public cloud to address peak load. 
Continuing strong proliferation of our digital and sign-up solutions, especially with market-shaping customers at the most-advanced nodes have driven share gains and double-digit year-to-date revenue growth. In addition to numerous 7-nanometer tapeouts, there are more than 15 customer engagements at 5- and 3-nanometer using our digital flow. MediaTek has deployed our digital full flow in production for their 7-nanometer design. 
At Mellanox, leading in -- the leader in technology -- in data, connectivity solutions, Innovus replaced the incumbent solution for all of their production 7-nanometer design. We also had a digital full-flow competitive win for 7-nanometer design with a leading Japanese imaging company. Uhnder used Cadence's digital full flow, which is based on common engines and includes Genus, Innovus, Tempus and Pegasus to achieve the best quality of results and the fastest convergent of their highly innovative and completely integrated first digital automotive radar on-chip.
Next, I will discuss highlights of our system design and verification solutions. Our Palladium Z1 emulator and the recently introduced Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping platform now provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, hardware, software regressions and earlier software development. Growing system design complexity and the high cost of failure continues to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z1. In Q3, the Z1 added 8 new customers and had key -- and have 8 key expansions. 
Rounding off our hardware family is the Protium X1, which is a perfect complement to our Palladium Z1. I'm excited by the strong customer interest in Protium X1. A global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and Protium X1 as well, making it one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence.
We had several full verification suite wins in Q3, including a major customer in Asia and an automotive semiconductor company in EMEA. In IP, our focused strategy and strong portfolio have enabled us to benefit from the continuing IP outsourcing trend. In Q3, we had our best-ever quarter for IP with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 20%. It was an especially strong quarter for our Tensilica products with additional wins in audio, imaging, computer vision and machine learning.
In system innovation segments of our Intelligent System Design strategy, we introduced the Celsius Thermal Solver, which joins the Clarity 3D EM Solver in the growing suite of our system analysis products. Celsius is a industry-first complete electrothermal co-simulation solution for the electronic system from ICs to system or to physical enclosures. Based on the proven, massively parallel architecture that delivers up to 10x faster performance with full accuracy, Celsius enables design teams to mitigate thermal issues at an earlier stage, thereby reducing system development iterations. Bosch and ARM have both endorsed these exciting new products, and we're in the midst of earlier discussion with several other customers. 
Clarity, which was announced earlier this year continue its strong momentum with 4 competitive wins during the quarter and more than 30 active customer engagements underway.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q3. As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2019.
Before we get into the Q3 results, I would like to take a moment and talk about the ongoing trade uncertainties. With more companies recently added to the entity list, the situation remains fluid, and we will continue to closely monitor it. For the purpose of providing guidance for 2019, we've assumed that the current export limitations remain in effect and the entity list remains unchanged for the remainder of the year.
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%. GAAP EPS was $0.36 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $655 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q3 was $139 million. DSOs were 43 days, and during Q3, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q4, we expect the following results: Revenue in the range of $590 million to $600 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.35; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54; and we expect to repurchase $75 million of Cadence shares. 
As a result, our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: Revenue in the range of $2.327 billion to $2.337 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.52; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.18 to $2.20; and operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $740 million. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in an uncertain environment. Our strong dependable results reflect the broad diversity of our global customer base. We remain focused on driving growth in our core business highlighted by the proliferation of our digital full flow, and we continue to invest in growth opportunities with market-shaping customers and new product areas.
In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners and, of course, our employees for their continued support.
And with that operator, we'll now take questions."

And we have more than 30 active customer engagements going forward. And so we're excited about that. 
And then meanwhile, we just announced our Celsius Thermal Solver. And again, back to that computational software strength that we have and we clearly demonstrate that up to 10x performance and customers are delighted to see our performance, specifically they are Bosch and ARM, they both endorse our new products and we're in middle of earlier discussion. 
So it's still in a very early stage of our emerging into the system analysis, and more and more, our customer love that because beside the EDA, beside the IP, they want to look at the total system solution, simulation, whether it fit the whole system, power, thermal envelopes. And something that we can really demonstrate and provide the best solution for the customer. So it's still very early. 
And in terms of our pricing, again, it's not part of our EDA, and so we do it differently and basically, close to the market competitive pricing, and -- but in a very early stage of winning and then, stay tune, over time, we will unfold and give you a progress update."

Let me start first, Jackson, and then John will give you more detail about the inventory. So I think first of all, I think Functional Verification remained the fastest-growing challenge for our customer. And I mentioned, in Q3 we are delighted to deepen our partnership with Samsung through comprehensive agreement across not just digital custom and also verification products. And then the Palladium Z1 had been doing great and the customer love it on the hardware emulation, but now we add the Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping that we can provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, especially for hardware, software regression and earlier software development. That combination using the same front-end software make it easier for the customer. And so I think we clearly see that in new customers and in key expansions, and so I think we are just delighted and very pleased Protium is giving a lot of opportunity for us. And we also highlight a global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and add on the Protium X1 as well make us -- make that one as a larger -- one of the largest hardware orders for Cadence. So I think all in all, we see strength. And then I think John can highlight the reason of building up the inventory."

And then we also, our Tensilica that's a very clear good engine for some of the AI application like the audio, video and various others and we are trying to build the software stack on top of the AI platform, so that we can provide a solution to our customer for the various vertical market they try to address."

But essentially, it's the same as where we were this time last quarter. Last quarter, we guided Q3 at 30% for op margin and Q4 for 30%. In Q3, the beat was mainly on the gross margin side. I mean, we assume gross margin comes out at about 90% in our estimates and we did better in Q3. It came out at, I think, it was at 91.6% and we landed at 31.7% for op margins. So most of the beat on the op margin side in Q3 was a result of gross margins. 
My expectation for Q4 is that we have a significant hardware pipeline heading into Q4. It was kind of similar. It reminds me of where we were this time last year. And last year, our gross margin ticked down, I think, 200 basis points from Q3 to Q4. So we're expecting about 30%. And that's because you've got a combination of things happening, right? You've got Q3 and Q4, we're assuming that there's no change in export limitations right now. We're also investing in proliferation opportunities, market-shaping customers and in new product areas. So that's what's driving the numbers."

First, you often use the term market-shaping customer. And it's frankly a somewhat odd expression. How do you define customers that fall into that category? And more specifically, how do you dedicate resources to those customers in terms of commitments and so forth? 
And then, a growth question. We've seen a number of categories in EDA have extended periods of consecutive growth. For example, the industry data, and of course, your numbers, the custom category has had more than 30 consecutive trailing 12-month periods of growth, IC implementation more than 16, PCB 12. So that's all very good, of course, but historically, EDA growth cycles for particular categories don't last for more than 3 to 4 years, 3 to 4 years each. But we've now seen multiple categories that are meeting or beating historical periods of consistent growth. So what's your thinking in terms of sustainability or what's different now vis-à-vis the different categories?"

The definition is that they're clearly the leaders in their sector. And so they're the most demanding customer, but because they are leader, they are driving the innovation, they're driving the performance. And we want to be the partners for them, the trusted partner to enable their innovation, to continue their leadership in the marketplace in the various different vertical market or the platform that they create. We want them -- we want to be the partner for them. And that is how we define the market-shaping customer. 
In terms of growth, as I mentioned, you can see in my passion. Clearly, in a way, we are not creating the changes, we arrive with the wave. And the beauty part in this particular junction of the industry, there's a 5 different wave driving the growth and they're changing the landscape of the requirement. As I just mentioned, one example, is AI and now we're moving into, I call it, the data-centric economy. It's all about data. And then today, it's only 2% of the data being analyzed and being utilized. So there's a humongous opportunity. 
And then this is applying to across all the different vertical and it's really driving the change to the memory, driving the change of the storage, driving the domain-specific processor. So in a way, it's workload-specific, depending on different workload, different market require different -- rather than just CPU/GPU or FPGA, there's a new class of workload that require different type of processor. And then we're also driving the memory, the storage, the infrastructure in terms of able to cope with the data, massive, massive explosion of data. And then so, all this is going to require new innovation in order to support that. Like, for example, the programmability, the scale out the storage and network and then scale out the top of the rack all the way to top on the spine in terms of the infrastructure, 12.8 terabyte per second to 51.2 terabytes per second switch. And all the high-speed interconnecting and that's why the SerDes is so important for high speed. And that's why Cadence bought it and then we're going to triple down on it to really drive the requirement that the hyperscale and the big infrastructure player need that. 
So I think it's going to be driving a lot of new innovation in semiconductor side, and we are learning and we're trying to be the trusted partner to fulfill some of these requirements. And that's why I mentioned earlier, the design activity increased a lot. And we're excited about it and it's just the beginning of it."

Our focus first of all is to have the best of breed for each product line, like the Innovus we mentioned earlier for place and route. Right now, it's a majority, over 70% of the customer are adopting it in the most advanced nodes. And then now we have the Genus come out, very strong, and then Tempus come out and Pegasus. The customers are starting to see that not only the best of breed of product and also how to integrate them, how to optimize them and correlations among all the different flow that we've been talking about last few years.

I'm pleased to report that Cadence achieved excellent operating results for the third quarter of 2019, delivering 9% year-over-year revenue growth. 
Based on our strong execution and strength of our technology and business, we are, again, raising our outlook for the year. Given the uncertainty of the ongoing trade situations with China, our outlook assume current export limitations remain in place for the rest of the year. John will provide more detail on our outlook shortly.
While global economy and geopolitical uncertainty continues, long-term trends such as AI, 5G, cloud and IoT continues to drive strong design activity. The move to domain-specific computing and system companies building custom silicon as well as a host of innovative silicon startups are all pushing the technology envelope and driving the need for high-performance, low-power computing, high-bandwidth connectivity and high-density storage.
Our Intelligent System Design strategy focus position us well to maximize the resulting opportunities through building out our portfolio and providing more capabilities and value to our customers. The foundation of our strategy is the design excellence segment, which comprise of our core EDA and IP business. I will now provide some of the key quarterly highlights in this area.
A key element of our approach has been to closely collaborate with our ecosystem partners and focus on market-shaping customers. In Q3, we deepened our partnership with Samsung through a comprehensive agreement across our digital, custom and verification product portfolio. 
Early this year, we had reported a breakthrough wide-ranging win with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company. I am particularly pleased that we augmented that partnership with our largest-ever IP order that included our Tensilica processor family and our design IP portfolio, including ultra-high-speed SerDes.
At its recent open innovation platform event, TSMC recognized Cadence with 4 Partners of the Year Awards, including an award for joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure, and 1 for joint delivery of cloud-based productivity solution. 
Our Cadence Cloud portfolio has great momentum with over 50 customers using our solution in the cloud. Cadence Cloud-ready products in close collaboration with our cloud infrastructure and foundry partners are enabling our customers to realize meaningful scalability, performance and flexibility benefits from using the cloud.
Our CloudBurst model is used for hybrid cloud infrastructures where customers want to augment their on-premise infrastructure with vast capacity from the public cloud to address peak load. 
Continuing strong proliferation of our digital and sign-up solutions, especially with market-shaping customers at the most-advanced nodes have driven share gains and double-digit year-to-date revenue growth. In addition to numerous 7-nanometer tapeouts, there are more than 15 customer engagements at 5- and 3-nanometer using our digital flow. MediaTek has deployed our digital full flow in production for their 7-nanometer design. 
At Mellanox, leading in -- the leader in technology -- in data, connectivity solutions, Innovus replaced the incumbent solution for all of their production 7-nanometer design. We also had a digital full-flow competitive win for 7-nanometer design with a leading Japanese imaging company. Uhnder used Cadence's digital full flow, which is based on common engines and includes Genus, Innovus, Tempus and Pegasus to achieve the best quality of results and the fastest convergent of their highly innovative and completely integrated first digital automotive radar on-chip.
Next, I will discuss highlights of our system design and verification solutions. Our Palladium Z1 emulator and the recently introduced Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping platform now provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SoC verification, hardware, software regressions and earlier software development. Growing system design complexity and the high cost of failure continues to drive strong demand for our Palladium Z1. In Q3, the Z1 added 8 new customers and had key -- and have 8 key expansions. 
Rounding off our hardware family is the Protium X1, which is a perfect complement to our Palladium Z1. I'm excited by the strong customer interest in Protium X1. A global marquee customer significantly expanded their existing hardware footprint with additional Z1 capacity and Protium X1 as well, making it one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence.
We had several full verification suite wins in Q3, including a major customer in Asia and an automotive semiconductor company in EMEA. In IP, our focused strategy and strong portfolio have enabled us to benefit from the continuing IP outsourcing trend. In Q3, we had our best-ever quarter for IP with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 20%. It was an especially strong quarter for our Tensilica products with additional wins in audio, imaging, computer vision and machine learning.
In system innovation segments of our Intelligent System Design strategy, we introduced the Celsius Thermal Solver, which joins the Clarity 3D EM Solver in the growing suite of our system analysis products. Celsius is a industry-first complete electrothermal co-simulation solution for the electronic system from ICs to system or to physical enclosures. Based on the proven, massively parallel architecture that delivers up to 10x faster performance with full accuracy, Celsius enables design teams to mitigate thermal issues at an earlier stage, thereby reducing system development iterations. Bosch and ARM have both endorsed these exciting new products, and we're in the midst of earlier discussion with several other customers. 
Clarity, which was announced earlier this year continue its strong momentum with 4 competitive wins during the quarter and more than 30 active customer engagements underway.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial results and provide our updated outlook."

I'm pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q3. As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business, we are increasing our outloo",430,"Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report we met or exceeded all of our key operating metrics in Q3. As a result of continuing robust demand for our solutions and strong execution across our business, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2019.
Before we get into the Q3 results, I would like to take a moment and talk about the ongoing trade uncertainties. With more companies recently added to the entity list, the situation remains fluid, and we will continue to closely monitor it. For the purpose of providing guidance for 2019, we've assumed that the current export limitations remain in effect and the entity list remains unchanged for the remainder of the year.
Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $580 million, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%. GAAP EPS was $0.36 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Next turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $655 million, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow for Q3 was $139 million. DSOs were 43 days, and during Q3, we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares.
Now I will provide our updated guidance. For Q4, we expect the following results: Revenue in the range of $590 million to $600 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.35; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52 to $0.54; and we expect to repurchase $75 million of Cadence shares. 
As a result, our updated guidance for fiscal 2019 is now as follows: Revenue in the range of $2.327 billion to $2.337 billion; non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5% to 32%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.52; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.18 to $2.20; and operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $740 million. You will find guidance for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our website.
In summary, I'm pleased with our execution in an uncertain environment. Our strong dependable results reflect the broad diversity of our global customer base. We remain focused on driving growth in our core business highlighted by the proliferation of our digital full flow, and we continue to invest in growth opportunities with market-shaping customers and new product areas.
In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners and, of course, our employees for their continued support.
And with that operator, we'll now take questions."

First of all, I think that we have our approach of the system analysis space and that's something that's really our core competence of computational software and that we can apply into this complex system analysis space. And then we have this 2 new product, initially we announced at Clarity. That is the 3D EM solver. We are delighted. We have 4 competitive wins and this is a very new product for us. And we have more than 30 active customer engagements going forward. And so we're excited about that. 
And then meanwhile, we just announced our Celsius Thermal Solver. And again, back to that computational software strength that we have and we clearly demonstrate that up to 10x performance and customers are delighted to see our performance, specifically they are Bosch and ARM, they both endorse our new products and we're in middle of earlier discussion. 
So it's still in a very early stage of our emerging into the system analysis, and more and more, our customer love that because beside the EDA, beside the IP, they want to look at the total system solution, simulation, whether it fit the whole system, power, thermal envelopes. And something that we can really demonstrate and provide the best solution for the customer. So it's still very early. 
And in terms of our pricing, again, it's not part of our EDA, and so we do it differently and basically, close to the market competitive pricing, and -- but in a very early stage of winning and then, stay tune, over time, we will unfold and give you a progress update."

Clearly, the -- our focus strategy and strong portfolio in IP and in fact, we keep on adding more IP portfolio beside the Tensilica, the memory, connectivity and we are excited about high-speed SerDes that we bought from nusemi and that 112-gig SerDes is a must-have from a lot of data center infrastructure build up and hyperscale guys really like it. And so I think we have a very -- we're pleased with our portfolio, and we are laser-focused on our strategy, focused on the leading customer and then focused on the advanced nodes and then focused on something that we can scale. 
And then so far, I think we have a very broad portfolio, but meanwhile, we are very delighted. And I mentioned earlier, this marquee semiconductor company beside we have wide-ranging win and now we add on this largest IP not just include Tensilica family, also include the design IP portfolio. We are excited about it just add on top of it, and we are really pleased with the progress. And IP is like the building block of the system. You really need the -- I call it the star IP that they must have, and we are really focused on the star IP."

So you can see the AI implication. 
And in fact, you are correct. If you look at the semiconductor growth recently and in terms of funding, a lot is driven by AI. AI is not just semiconductor; it's applied into all the different vertical industries. So the impact can be quite huge. And we're excited about this opportunity. The design activities increase a lot.

My expectation for Q4 is that we have a significant hardware pipeline heading into Q4. It was kind of similar. It reminds me of where we were this time last year. And last year, our gross margin ticked down, I think, 200 basis points from Q3 to Q4. So we're expecting about 30%. And that's because you've got a combination of things happening, right?

And then, a growth question. We've seen a number of categories in EDA have extended periods of consecutive growth. For example, the industry data, and of course, your numbers, the custom category has had more than 30 consecutive trailing 12-month periods of growth, IC implementation more than 16, PCB 12. So that's all very good, of course, but historically, EDA growth cycles for particular categories don't last for more than 3 to 4 years, 3 to 4 years each. But we've now seen multiple categories that are meeting or beating historical periods of consistent growth. So what's your thinking in terms of sustainability or what's different now vis-à-vis the different categories?"

The definition is that they're clearly the leaders in their sector. And so they're the most demanding customer, but because they are leader, they are driving the innovation, they're driving the performance. And we want to be the partners for them, the trusted partner to enable their innovation, to continue their leadership in the marketplace in the various different vertical market or the platform that they create. We want them -- we want to be the partner for them. And that is how we define the market-shaping customer. 
In terms of growth, as I mentioned, you can see in my passion. Clearly, in a way, we are not creating the changes, we arrive with the wave. And the beauty part in this particular junction of the industry, there's a 5 different wave driving the growth and they're changing the landscape of the requirement. As I just mentioned, one example, is AI and now we're moving into, I call it, the data-centric economy. It's all about data. And then today, it's only 2% of the data being analyzed and being utilized. So there's a humongous opportunity. 
And then this is applying to across all the different vertical and it's really driving the change to the memory, driving the change of the storage, driving the domain-specific processor. So in a way, it's workload-specific, depending on different workload, different market require different -- rather than just CPU/GPU or FPGA, there's a new class of workload that require different type of processor. And then we're also driving the memory, the storage, the infrastructure in terms of able to cope with the data, massive, massive explosion of data. And then so, all this is going to require new innovation in order to support that. Like, for example, the programmability, the scale out the storage and network and then scale out the top of the rack all the way to top on the spine in terms of the infrastructure, 12.8 terabyte per second to 51.2 terabytes per second switch. And all the high-speed interconnecting and that's why the SerDes is so important for high speed. And that's why Cadence bought it and then we're going to triple down on it to really drive the requirement that the hyperscale and the big infrastructure player need that. 
So I think it's going to be driving a lot of new innovation in semiconductor side, and we are learning and we're trying to be the trusted partner to fulfill some of these requirements. And that's why I mentioned earlier, the design activity increased a lot. And we're excited about it and it's just the beginning of it."

So I think this is just our initial entry to the system analysis using our core computant on computation software. And stay tuned. I mean, we are just beginning. We have -- first product came out in April as you correctly point out, with good tractions. And now the second product came out. People love the performance. They're excited about it. 
We are continuing to investing and it tie-in also very well with our PCB business and that the whole system modeling, system simulation will be really exciting area for us. So stay tuned. And we will update you when we announce any new products."

So I think when you move down the geometry to 7 to 5 to 3, try to integrate different product, different tool from different customer, that means that you have to build internal team to do all the integration. And also you have a lot of opportunity to fail because the different tool have different methodology. And so the customers starting to really focus on getting a full flow, the best -- I think it's very important. Our focus first of all is to have the best of breed for each product line, like the Innovus we mentioned earlier for place and route. Right now, it's a majority, over 70% of the customer are adopting it in the most advanced nodes. And then now we have the Genus come out, very strong, and then Tempus come out and Pegasus. The customers are starting to see that not only the best of breed of product and also how to integrate them, how to optimize them and correlations among all the different flow that we've been talking about last few years. And so right now, we can not only have the best of breed for each product, now we can integrate, and that's why you're starting to hear that we mentioned a lot about digital full flow that our customers depend completely on us on the most advanced node in the 7 and 5 and 3 and that's the way we're going to continue to support the customer."

They are going to be very important for our industry because they are quietly building up. As I mentioned earlier, their workload requirement have changed and it's more about data. And then, so that domain-specific processing development and also in the server, into the data storage network, scale out going to be even more and more important for them. And great partners for us and great customer, and we love them. And first of all, they are a bit different on our semiconductor players. Time to market is more important to them and also performance, scalability is most important to them. And that part, I think we worked very -- from the early days, we are already working and partner with them, and we are also very excited about the cloud infrastructure that we also support the cloud infrastructure using some of our tool to do that. We continue the leadership on that. 
So I think in multiple expects, we are working with our partners in the cloud and we are excited about the opportunity."
