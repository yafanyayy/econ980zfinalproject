Thanks for joining us on our conference call to discuss ADT's fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2012. With me this morning are ADT's Chief Executive Officer, Naren Gursahaney; and ADT's Chief Financial Officer, Kathryn Mikells. Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and our Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2012, which we expect to file with the SEC later today.
In the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release and accompanying slides, which are now posted on our website at adt.com, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
For those of you following on the webcast, we will be using the slide deck that you see to supplement our comments this morning. Please note that unless otherwise mentioned, references to our operating results, excludes a special items of these metrics are non-GAAP measures. 
One quick housekeeping item, if I may, before I get into our formal remarks. If you recall, as part of Tyco, our fiscal 2011 included a 53rd week. This had the effect of adding an extra week of production units in last year's fourth quarter but the impact to revenue and operating income was minimal because our revenue recognition reflects advanced billing for the entire month. We've like to cover this morning so let me turn the call over to Naren for some opening comments."

As Craig mentioned, we've got a lot to cover this morning as we intend to review our financial results for our fiscal fourth quarter and the total year 2012, as well as discuss guidance for 2013. In addition, based on feedback we received during our Investor Day and roadshow, as well as subsequent discussions with several shareholders, we included 2 important additional topics for discussion today. Kathy will provide additional details on our expectations around our cash tax rate for the next several years. Following this, I will spend a few minutes discussing our philosophy around our capital structure and capital allocation for ADT.
As you saw on our press release this morning, we declared our initial quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. In addition, our Board has approved a 3-year $2 billion share repurchase program. Both of these actions were made in the context of a thoughtful capital policy that is based on our overall business strategy and the opportunities and risks we see for our business. Again, I will discuss these in greater detail later on the call.
Our fiscal fourth quarter was another solid quarter for ADT. Total revenue during the quarter, was $812 million, which represents 2.3% growth over the fourth quarter of last year, while recurring revenue grew by 5.2% to $742 million. For the full year, recurring revenue was up 5% and continued to account for 90% of our total revenue.
EBITDA during the quarter was $401 million, with an EBITDA margin of 49.4%. For the total year, we generated $1.6 billion of EBITDA, which was up approximately 5% versus the prior year. Kathy will provide some color on free cash flow comparisons and will also walk you through our steady-state free cash flow metric, which is a key performance metric where we will be using going forward. EPS before special items was $0.43 for the quarter and $1.74 for the full year, both up approximately 5% over the prior year.
Our results for the quarter were in line with the updated guidance we provided during our Investor Day meeting on September 18th. These results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to grow revenues and EBITDA even as we invest to grow our business.
As we've discussed in the past, ADT operates a subscriber business model whereby we make on investment upfront to bring on a customer and then generate our return on that investment through our monthly monitoring and service fees over the life of that customer relationship. On average, our customers stay with us for close to 7 years. In This model, there are 5 drivers of value creation. Our ability to bring on new customers to our direct and ADT authorized dealer channels or gross additions, the net cost of bringing on new customers, subscriber subscription costs or SAC, the average monthly fee we collect from our customers, average revenue for customer or ARPU, the cost we incur in order to provide these services, cost to serve and the time our customers stay with us and continue to pay the monthly fee, tenure where the opposite attrition. Optimizing these 5 levers allows us to grow our business profitably generate a strong return on investment. Depending on the specific product line and channel to market, these returns average between 14% and 21%.
During the fourth quarter and throughout our fiscal year 2012, we made solid progress across several of these key value drivers. Gross adds grew by 5.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year after adjusting for the extra week we had in last year's results. For the full year, gross adds increased by 8.7% as we achieved solid growth across both our direct and dealer channels. Our subscriber acquisition cost per customer in our direct sales channel was up 3.8% versus last year driven primarily by higher Pulse stake rates. Our dealer channel SAC per customer was up 3.5% versus last year due to higher ARPU in that channel. 
The continued success of Pulse also helped fuel ARPU growth. In the quarter, new and resale ARPU increased by 5.7% to $42.99, while the average ARPU of our overall customer base grew by 4.4% year-over-year. For the year, new and resale ARPU increased by 3.6% to $42.02. The ARPU for new Pulse customers continues to be around $50 per month. 
The cost to serve margin on gross additions was just over 70% for the total year. This includes the impact of the legal matters we discussed at our Investor Day in September. Excluding these costs, our margin rate for the year was up slightly versus the prior year with the higher ARPU and productivity more than offsetting the higher cost to serve associated with our Pulse offering.
During the quarter, attrition grew by 30 basis points on a quarter sequential basis to 13.8%. The majority of the increase came from voluntary disconnects, which includes the carryover of the accelerated price escalations we implemented during the second and third quarters. As we've discussed in the past, the leading driver of disconnects in our business is relocations, which makes up 35% to 40% of our disconnects. The recovery we are seeing in the housing market is expected to continue to put pressure on our attrition number. However, this should also great opportunities for new systems sales or gross adds. After relocations, both voluntary and non-pay attrition, each account for between 20% and 30% of our disconnects, while lost to competition accounts for the remaining 10% of the total.
In order to provide greater transparency to our overall performance in selling and installing Pulse, we've made some changes in how we calculate and report our Pulse take rates. Our new metric reflects total Pulse installations as a percentage of our total installations for the period, excluding home health, which is really only a PERS product today. This metric covers both new sales and resales in our direct residential and small-business channels, as well as new sales in our dealer channel as our dealers don't participate in resales.
I will also provide a total Pulse take rate that reflexive the combination of our direct and indirect channels. As this change may create some comparison issues for you, I'll also provide prior period and prior year performance numbers to help address this. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the continuation of the positive growth trends in Pulse take rates. In our direct residential channel, the take rate was 23%, reflecting a 3-point improvement versus prior quarter and a 13-point improvement over the same quarter last year. Our Pulse take rate in our small business channel was 15%, which was up 4 points over the prior quarter and up 13 points compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
Our Pulse take rate in the dealer channel was about 1%, primarily reflecting the friends and family pilots I've mentioned the past, and we expect the dealer number to begin ramping up this quarter. In total, across all channels, 13% of our gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Pulse customers represented just under 3% of our 6.4 million customers.
Before I turn things over to Kathy, I want to mention important event that happened subsequent to the close of our fiscal year. On October 3rd, we completed the acquisition of absolute security for approximately $30 million. Absolute had been an ADT authorized dealer with a very successful self-generated lead sales model, including a strong doorknocking capability. As part of this transaction, Absolute's Founder and CEO, Curtains Weinstein, will be joining ADT's leadership team. Curtis will report to Senior Vice President of sales and lead our newly crated self-generated division, which we have named ADT Direct Connect. ADT Direct Connect will include the Absolute sales team, as well as the sales reps that were part of ADT's self-generated lead pilot program. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012, along with the subsequent actions we have taken reflect the strength of our business model and our commitment to investing to grow our business, while returning surplus capital to our shareholders in an efficient manner.
Now I'll turn things over to Kathy to provide some additional details on our results for the quarter and the full year."
184157327,223845402,391326,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 27, 2012",2012-11-27,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin with our overall results consistent with the guidance we've provided in September.",2138,"Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin with our overall results consistent with the guidance we've provided in September. Before I get started, I wanted to note a few things that impacted our results.
During the third quarter, we implemented a change in our direct channel to increase the mix of our gross adds toward more ADT-owned system rather than outright systems sales. This change results in more upfront installation revenue being deferred, as well as the installation costs and commissions associated with that revenue. The change reduced nonrecurring revenue by about $19 million in the fourth quarter and $28 million for the full year. The benefit to operating income was roughly $4 million for the quarter and $6 million for the full year. The ownership mix change has virtually no impact on our overall cash flow or economic return.
I also wanted to note that we incurred $15 million in charges in the quarter associated with various legal-related matters. This was consistent with the guidance that we had provided.
Now I'd like to walk through our financial performance for the quarter. Our recurring revenue grew 5.2% year-over-year to $472 million. The growth was driven by a 4% increase in average revenue per customer and a 1% increase in our average customer base. About half of the average revenue gains were due to price escalations, with the remaining half due to the richer mix from new customers addition, including those who chose our Pulse service.
Nonrecurring revenue, which includes the balance of the revenue categories you see on the slide was down 21% year-over-year due to the makeshift toward ADT-owned system. Total revenue was $812 million for the quarter, up 2.3%. Our total operating expenses before items were $634 million, up 4% or $26 million. The increase was driven by $18 million in higher cost service supporting our recurring revenue growth; $15 million charges for legal related matters that are reflected in our cost to serve expenses; and $21 million higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increased costs were partially offset by $29 million lower SAC expenses, driven primarily by the deferral of subscriber acquisition cost due to the mix shift which reduced outright system sales. Operating income was $178 million, down $8 million versus last year. Our operating margin was 21.9% at the high-end of our guidance.
EBITDA was $401 million this quarter, up 3% and EBITDA margin was 49.4%, up 30 basis points from prior year. Excluding cost from legal-related matters and normalizing for the increase and ADT-owned system, EBITDA margin would have been 49.6% or up 50 basis points from last year.
Turning to Slide 8, there was a good deal of noise in our cash flow comparison due to the spin-off from Tyco with prior period data presented on a carve-out basis, reflecting allocations for certain assets, liabilities and expenses. Although EBITDA for the fourth quarter was up $11 million versus prior year, our cash flow from operations decreased 9% or $34 million to $362 million. About $17 million of that negative variance is due to the allocation of certain legacy taxes made in conjunction with the spend. Additionally, our core working capital slipped from being a source of cash in the first -- in the fourth quarter of last year to a use of cash this year, contributing another $39 million of a negative variance. Most of that working capital variance was associated with the split from Tyco commercial security business, which artificially reduced our payable balance and inflated inventory as we no longer benefit from inventory pooling with commercial. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $281 million with all but $17 million of that in investment spend on new subscribers. Free cash flow was $86 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our full year results on Slide 9, recurring revenue grew 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by a 1% increase in our average account base and a 4% increase in average revenue per customer. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 5.8% due to fewer outright systems sales. Total revenue of $3.2 billion increased about 4%.
Now I'm going to walk you through the full year operating expenses so you can see how some of our direct channel subscriber acquisition cost flow through our income statement. Our total operating expenses were $2.5 billion, up about 4% versus prior year. Our total operating expenses were mainly comprised of $943 million for cost of service; $523 million for gross subscriber acquisition cost; and $982 million for depreciation and amortization. Details of our cost to serve expenses can be found on Slide 20 and subscriber acquisition cost are detailed on Slide 21, both of which can be found in the Appendix to the slide presentation.
The $92 million increase in operating expenses versus last year was driven by a $38 million or 4% increase in cost of service that supports our recurring revenue growth; $15 million in charges for legal matters booked in cost of service in the fourth quarter; and a $55 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by $20 million of lower current period subscriber acquisition expenses. While direct channel gross account additions were up about 6% to 7% year-over-year on a reported actual basis, the change in mix toward ADT-owned system reduced current period recognized tax expenses by about $34 million.
EBITDA was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of $75 million or 5% versus fiscal 2011. EBITDA margin of 49.8% expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the $15 million in expenses for various legal-related matters incurred in the fourth quarter and normalizing for the change in mix toward ADT-owned system, EBITDA margin was 49.7%, a 40-basis point improvement versus prior year.
If we look at the EBITDA margin, excluding both the subscriber acquisition revenue and subscriber acquisition expenses that run through our P&L, our EBITDA margin for the full year was 63.2%.
Turning to Slide 10, our full year cash flow from operation was $1.5 billion or 4% above our fiscal 2011 results. The spend related impacts I discussed in reviewing the quarterly cash flow results also affected the full year results. EBITDA grew by about $75 million, our operating cash flow only increased by $54 million. The cash flow benefit from the EBITDA improvement was muted by about a $50 million use of cash for core working capital due to higher inventory levels and lower trade payables.
CapEx totaled about $1.1 billion for the year, a $185 million increase over last year. $155 million of that increase was for subscriber investment with $32 million of that attributable to the makeshift toward more ADT-owned system. We spent an additional $30 million on IT primarily to enhance productivity and to support the split of the North American residential and Commercial businesses. When we sum everything up, we generated free cash flow of $432 million for the year. Free cash flow decreased from the prior year mainly due to higher capital investment to drive recurring revenue growth. 
At our Investor Day, I discussed why our free cash flow was not the best metric to gauge our business as much of our capital investment drives new account growth that immediately generates revenue. On Slide 11, we provide a calculation for steady-state free cash flow that I'd like to review. We believe this metric is a better indicator of the cash flow generation capability of our base business. In determining steady-state free cash flow, we calculate the amount of revenue that needs to be replaced to hold recurring revenue constant. We then drive the level of investment that's required to obtain that recurring revenue. The difference in CapEx is our investment for growth, which we then add back to free cash flow. On this basis, we generated $952 million in steady-state free cash flow. 
Starting at the top of the slide, you can see for this past year, we lost $486 million in recurring revenue from gross attrition. Gross attrition is calculated net of replacement contractually provided by dealers and before accounting for resale. After considering price escalations on the existing account base, we have $404 million in recurring revenue to replace. We then look at our direct channel to source that recurring revenue requirement. In the past year, we sourced 634,000 gross customer adds through our direct channel at an average new revenue per customer of $41.60 generating $316 million in annualized recurring revenue.
Since we still have an $88 million shortfall remaining, we look to our dealer channel to backfill for that. We pay our dealers a gross multiple of about 33x recurring monthly revenue or about 2.7x annual recurring revenue. So it costs us $241 million to replace the remaining revenue loss from attrition. We then reduce our annual capital expenditures for the amount of that gross investment in dealer acquired account that the spending about what we needed to fully offset the revenue loss from attrition. The resulting steady-state free cash flow is $952 million. We believe this metric is a good indication of the cash flow strength of our business.
Now I'd like to focus on Slide 13, our guidance for fiscal 2013. We expect recurring revenue to continue to grow at the rate we've seen over the past several quarters at approximately 4.9% to 5.2%, with the underlying recurring revenue growth drivers being consistent with recent trends. This is at the lower end of the multi-year guidance that we provided on Investor Day.
In terms of EBITDA before items, we expect to see up to a 70 basis point improvement in our margins versus 2012. There's a number of factors that are impacting EBITDA margin year-over-year. On the positive side, the change to more ADT-owned systems will give us the benefit of about $15 million and we don't expect to repeat the $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that we booked this past quarter. However, we expect our total corporate cost to be about $70 million, which is $15 million higher than fiscal '12, which was largely cost allocated from Tyco.
Additionally, we'll incur synergies related to the splitting of the North America residential and Commercial businesses of about $40 million, which is $35 million higher than fiscal '12. Finally, we expect Hurricane Sandy will have about a $10 million negative impact mainly from the cost of incremental Field Services and incremental call center volume. In total, the impact of these items is $30 million unfavorable or about 95 basis points. We expect to mitigate that by our ongoing focus on productivity program. 
Interest expense is expected to be about $120 million to $125 million, and reflects about $20 million to $25 million from new debt we expect to occur later this year consistent with our new leverage target which Naren will talk about in a moment. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 38%.
Turning to cash flow, we expect a range of $375 million to $425 million in free cash flow after interest and taxes and $950 million to $1 billion in steady-state free cash flow before interest and taxes. We expect our cash tax rate to be 3% to 4% and this rate is built into our cash flow guidance.
As Naren mentioned, we're providing longer-term guidance on our cash tax rate as you can see here on Slide 15. We've closed out fiscal 2012 with our gross NOL at about $1.3 billion. In addition, we're changing that tax treatment of the intangible asset created when we generate account to our dealers. As a result, cost to generate new account through ADT-authorized dealer channel will be expense for tax purposes in the year on which the accounts are generated. This change is expected to provide onetime additional tax benefit for assets currently on the books of between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, as well as ongoing benefits for new addition. Depending on the pretax income level, utilization of the NOLs should allow us to maintain a cash tax rate of 5% to 8% from 2014 through 2019. As we will not pay federal or state AMT this year, our tax rate will be about 3% to 4% in fiscal 2013. 
Once the NOLs are fully utilized and assuming we continue at a modest mid-single-digit growth rate, we expect to the cash tax rate to move up to between 15% and 20% in 2020 and then to stabilize between 25% and 30% through 2022. Actual cash tax rate will depend on a number of items, including growth rates and profitability, sales channel mix, geographic mix of pretax income and any incremental tax planning opportunities we implement.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Naren."

As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independen",617,"Thanks, Kathy. The last topic we want to cover this morning is our capital structure. As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independent public company. We have also received input from several of our shareholders both during the equity investor roadshow and over the course of the last 2 months. We strongly believe that our capital structure must be appropriate for both our business model and the key strategies we are pursuing. In our case, we have a business model that generates strong recurring revenues and attractive finished financial returns. In addition, our business requires an upfront cash investment to support growth, and our strategies contemplates some very exciting organic and M&A-related growth opportunities. These opportunities include the acceleration of sales of our Pulse offerings to increase the penetration of home security and position us as a leader in home automation; strengthening our presence and capabilities in the small-business market and further expansion into adjacent markets like Home Health. These opportunities and the associated technology changes have brought some new competitors through our traditional markets, as well as these new markets. While we feel very good about our position and capabilities compared to these new competitors and peers, there is no question they also have strong capabilities, considerable scale and are very well-capitalized to pursue their gross strategies in these markets. 
With this as a backdrop, we feel, it is important that we maintain a capital structure that is consistent with investment-grade ratings. This will help ensure that we have reliable and affordable access to capital and the financial flexibility to support our growth strategies. Based on our discussions with the rating agencies and our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating, we have targeted an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. 
As we think about the implications of this leverage ratio on our 2013 capital allocation plans, our fundamental approach reflects discipline and balance. We intend to manage our capital in a thoughtful manner, seeking to grow long-term shareholder value by balancing the cost of debt and access to liquidity with investing for growth, organic and inorganic growth, as well as returning excess capital to shareholders in an efficient manner. Based on our EBITDA guidance and incremental debt capacity, we would have between $2.25 billion and $2.5 billion of cash available to deploy across the business. We expect to use $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion to support organic growth in our business. We've earmarked about $55 million for productivity investments, primarily IT investments to strengthen our back-office processes. 
We are targeting between $100 million to $150 million for bolt-on acquisitions in both purchases of accounts. While we expect some larger strategic acquisitions to be available to us in the future, we would evaluate the appropriate funding approach for these types of acquisitions on a case-by-case basis. Depending on actual growth rates, this would leave us $900 million to $1 billion available to return to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchase. The dividend and share repurchase plans announced this morning are consistent with this capital allocation approach. 
To wrap up our formal comments, I feel very good about the performance this quarter and our prospects for continued growth at attractive returns and for generating excess cash flow that can be deployed very efficiently over time. We are excited at the opportunities ahead of us and look forward to leveraging all of the ADT resources to drive great success as an independent public company. 
With that, we can move to our Q&A period. So I'll ask Kathryn to give you the instructions to ask questions."

Our returns are good. Some metrics up, some metrics down. For example, our Pulse take rates in those markets tends to be better. And we believe part of that is just greater awareness of the interactive service capabilities because of the advertising they're doing. So again, I don't see a significant difference in our performance in those markets versus other markets. That's not to say that they're not making inroads. Like I said, we believe that if they are making inroads in our expense. It may be at expense of some other traditional players. But the awareness is out there. They are advertising a pretty substantially. And we want to make sure that we're maintaining not just our relevance in the market, but continuing to advertise and continuing to stress our market leader position and the competitive advantages that we believe we have in that marketplace with both our products, but as well as our service and our coverage."

I mean, really that was our motivation behind the Absolute security acquisition that we made that I announced during the comments. Our Absolute -- the Absolute business had a very strong doorknocking capability. We had run some pilots in our own over the past year. And I'd say we had some success but being able to get some scale and being able to get some strong leadership that has built and run a self-generated leads doorknocking sales force was important to us. So we think that it is an opportunity for us to both grow our business but also grow our business efficiently without the significant advertising spend. I think that our self-generated sales force will have the Halo effect of the advertising that we do. So there should be some benefits there. And I think it is an opportunity. The key for us is going to be making sure that we continue to have very disciplined sales process there. I mean, one of the downsides of the door knockers as you have some players out there that have not been ethical in their business practices and this is why we wanted to have control over this channel.

And we put productivity tools in that has also. As we've talked about in the past, we deployed iPads to all of our direct sales reps over the past year, 1.5 years. And it really does make it easier for them to sale Pulse because they can demonstrate it live and allow the customer to experience what the Pulse system does first hand. So I would say the training and that transition on the direct side has been very good. And that's reflective on the continuous increase we've seen in our take rates. And we're applying the lessons learned as we roll it out to our dealer channel. Again, we're providing the first round of training with them -- to them and we'll continue to record them.

Thanks for joining us on our conference call to discuss ADT's fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2012. With me this morning are ADT's Chief Executive Officer, Naren Gursahaney; and ADT's Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Mikells. 
Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2012, which we expect to file with the SEC later today.
In the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release and accompanying slides, which are now posted on our website at adt.com, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explained why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
For those of you following on the webcast, we will be using the slide deck that you see to supplement our comments this morning. Please note that unless otherwise mentioned, references to our operating results exclude special items, and these metrics are non-GAAP measures. 
One quick housekeeping item, if I may, before we get into our formal remarks. If you recall, as part of Tyco, our fiscal 2011 included a 53rd week. This had the effect of adding an extra week of production units in last year's fourth quarter, but the impact to revenue and operating income was minimal because our revenue recognition reflects advanced billing for the entire month. We have a lot to cover this morning, so let me turn the call over to Naren for some opening comments."

Thank you all for joining us on our first earnings conference call as a stand-alone public company. As Craig mentioned, we've got a lot to cover this morning as we intend to review our financial results for our fiscal fourth quarter and the total year 2012, as well as discuss guidance for 2013. In addition, based on feedback we received during our Investor Day and roadshow, as well as subsequent discussions with several shareholders, we included 2 important additional topics for discussion today. Kathy will provide additional details on our expectations around our cash tax rate for the next several years. Following this, I will spend a few minutes discussing our philosophy around our capital structure and capital allocation for ADT.
As you saw on our press release this morning, we declared our initial quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. In addition, our board has approved a 3-year $2 billion share repurchase program. Both of these actions were made in the context of a thoughtful capital policy that is based on our overall business strategy and the opportunities and risks we see for our business. Again, I'll discuss these in greater detail later on the call.
Our fiscal fourth quarter was another solid quarter for ADT. Total revenue during the quarter, was $812 million, which represents 2.3% growth over the fourth quarter of last year, while recurring revenue grew by 5.2% to $742 million. For the full year, recurring revenue was up 5% and continued to account for 90% of our total revenue.
EBITDA during the quarter was $401 million, with an EBITDA margin of 49.4%. For the total year, we generated $1.6 billion of EBITDA, which was up approximately 5% versus the prior year. Kathy will provide some color on free cash flow comparisons and will also walk you through our steady-state free cash flow metric, which is a key performance metric we will be using going forward. EPS before special items was $0.43 for the quarter and $1.74 for the full year, both up approximately 5% over the prior year.
Our results for the quarter were in line with the updated guidance we provided during our Investor Day meeting on September 18th. These results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to grow revenues and EBITDA even as we invest to grow our business.
As we've discussed in the past, ADT operates a subscriber business model, whereby we make an investment upfront to bring on a customer and then generate our return on that investment through our monthly monitoring and service fees over the life of that customer relationship. On average, our customers stay with us for close to 7 years. 
In this model, there are 5 drivers of value creation: our ability to bring on new customers to our direct and ADT-authorized dealer channels or gross additions; the net cost of bringing on new customers, subscriber acquisition costs or SAC; the average monthly fee we collect from our customers, average revenue per customer or ARPU; the cost we incur in order to provide these services, cost to serve; and the time our customers stay with us and continue to pay the monthly fee, tenure, or the opposite, attrition. Optimizing these 5 levers allows us to grow our business profitably and generate a strong return on investment. Depending on the specific product line and channel to market, these returns average between 14% and 21%.
During the fourth quarter and throughout our fiscal year 2012, we made solid progress across several of these key value drivers. Gross adds grew by 5.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year after adjusting for the extra week we had in last year's results. For the full year, gross adds increased by 8.7% as we achieved solid growth across both our direct and dealer channels. Our subscriber acquisition cost per customer in our direct sales channel was up 3.8% versus last year, driven primarily by higher Pulse take rates. Our dealer channel SAC per customer was up 3.5% versus last year due to higher ARPU in that channel. The continued success of Pulse also helped fuel ARPU growth. 
In the quarter, new and resale ARPU increased by 5.7% to $42.99, while the average ARPU of our overall customer base grew by 4.4% year-over-year. For the year, new and resale ARPU increased by 3.6% to $42.02. The ARPU for new Pulse customers continues to be around $50 per month. 
The cost to serve margin on gross additions was just over 70% for the total year. This includes the impact of the legal matters we discussed at our Investor Day in September. Excluding these costs, our margin rate for the year was up slightly versus the prior year, with the higher ARPU and productivity more than offsetting the higher cost to serve associated with our Pulse offerings.
During the quarter, attrition grew by 30 basis points on a quarter sequential basis to 13.8%. The majority of the increase came from voluntary disconnects, which includes the carryover of the accelerated price escalations we implemented during the second and third quarters. As we've discussed in the past, the leading driver of disconnects in our business is relocations, which makes up 35% to 40% of our disconnects. The recovery we are seeing in the housing market is expected to continue to put pressure on our attrition number. However, this should also create opportunities for new system sales or gross adds. After relocations, both voluntary and non-pay attrition each account for between 20% and 30% of our disconnects, while lost to competition accounts for the remaining 10% of the total.
In order to provide greater transparency to our overall performance in selling and installing Pulse, we've made some changes in how we calculate and report our Pulse take rates. Our new metric reflects total Pulse installations as a percentage of our total installations for the period, excluding home health, which is really only a PERS product today. This metric covers both new sales and resales in our direct residential and small business channels, as well as new sales in our dealer channel as our dealers don't participate in resales. I will also provide a total Pulse take rate that reflects the combination of our direct and indirect channels. As this change may create some comparison issues for you, I'll also provide prior period and prior year performance numbers to help address this. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the continuation of the positive growth trends in Pulse take rates. In our direct residential channel, the take rate was 23%, reflecting a 3-point improvement versus prior quarter and a 13-point improvement over the same quarter last year. Our Pulse take rate in our small business channel was 15%, which was up 4 points over the prior quarter and up 13 points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our Pulse take rate in the dealer channel was about 1%, primarily reflecting the friends and family pilots I've mentioned in the past. And we expect the dealer number to begin ramping up this quarter. In total, across all channels, 13% of our gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Pulse customers represented just under 3% of our 6.4 million customers.
Before I turn things over to Kathy, I want to mention an important event that happened subsequent to the close of our fiscal year. On October 3rd, we completed the acquisition of Absolute Security for approximately $30 million. Absolute had been an ADT-authorized dealer with a very successful self-generated lead sales model, including a strong door-knocking capability. As part of this transaction, Absolute's Founder and CEO, Curtiss Weinstein, will be joining ADT's leadership team. Curtiss will report to Steve Gribbon, our Senior Vice President of Sales, and lead our newly created self-generated sales division, which we have named ADT Direct Connect. ADT Direct Connect will include the Absolute sales team, as well as the sales reps that were part of ADT's self-generated lead pilot program. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012, along with the subsequent actions we have taken, reflect the strength of our business model and our commitment to investing to grow our business while returning surplus capital to our shareholders in an efficient manner.
Now I'll turn things over to Kathy to provide some additional details on our results for the quarter and the full year."
184157327,223845402,391437,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 27, 2012",2012-11-27,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with our overall results consistent with the guidance we've provided in September",2136,"Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with our overall results consistent with the guidance we've provided in September. 
Before I get started, I wanted to note a few things that impacted our results. During the third quarter, we implemented a change in our direct channel to increase the mix of our gross adds toward more ADT-owned systems rather than outright system sales. This change results in more upfront installation revenue being deferred, as well as the installation costs and commissions associated with that revenue. The change reduced nonrecurring revenue by about $19 million in the fourth quarter and $28 million for the full year. The benefit to operating income was roughly $4 million for the quarter and $6 million for the full year. The ownership mix change has virtually no impact on our overall cash flow or economic return. I also wanted to note that we incurred $15 million in charges in the quarter associated with various legal-related matters. This was consistent with the guidance that we had provided.
Now I'd like to walk through our financial performance for the quarter. Our recurring revenue grew 5.2% year-over-year to $472 million. The growth was driven by a 4% increase in average revenue per customer and a 1% increase in our average customer base. About half of the average revenue gains were due to price escalations, with the remaining half due to the richer mix from new customer addition, including those who chose our Pulse service.
Nonrecurring revenue, which includes the balance of the revenue categories you see on the slide, was down 21% year-over-year due to the mix shift toward ADT-owned systems. Total revenue was $812 million for the quarter, up 2.3%. 
Our total operating expenses before items were $634 million, up 4% or $26 million. The increase was driven by $18 million in higher cost of service supporting our recurring revenue growth, $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that are reflected in our cost to serve expenses, and $21 million higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increased costs were partially offset by $29 million lower SAC expenses, driven primarily by the deferral of subscriber acquisition cost due to the mix shift which reduced outright system sales. 
Operating income was $178 million, down $8 million versus last year. Our operating margin was 21.9% at the high end of our guidance.
EBITDA was $401 million this quarter, up 3%, and EBITDA margin was 49.4%, up 30 basis points from prior year. Excluding costs from legal-related matters and normalizing for the increase in ADT-owned systems, EBITDA margin would have been 49.6% or up 50 basis points from last year.
Turning to Slide 8. There was a good deal of noise in our cash flow comparisons due to the spin-off from Tyco, with prior period data presented on a carve-out basis, reflecting allocations for certain assets, liabilities and expenses. Although EBITDA for the fourth quarter was up $11 million versus prior year, our cash flow from operations decreased 9% or $34 million to $362 million. About $17 million of that negative variance is due to the allocation of certain legacy taxes made in conjunction with the spend. Additionally, our core working capital flipped from being a source of cash in the first -- in the fourth quarter of last year to a use of cash this year, contributing another $39 million of the negative variance. Most of that working capital variance was associated with the split from Tyco commercial security business, which artificially reduced our capital balance and inflated inventory as we no longer benefit from inventory pooling with commercial. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $281 million, with all but $17 million of that in investment spend on new subscribers. Free cash flow was $86 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our full year results on Slide 9. Recurring revenue grew 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by a 1% increase in our average account base and a 4% increase in average revenue per customer. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 5.8% due to fewer outright system sales. Total revenue of $3.2 billion increased about 4%.
Now I'm going to walk you through the full year operating expenses, so you can see how some of our direct channel subscriber acquisition costs flow through our income statement. Our total operating expenses were $2.5 billion, up about 4% versus prior year. Our total operating expenses were mainly comprised of $943 million for cost of service, $523 million for gross subscriber acquisition cost and $982 million for depreciation and amortization. Details of our cost to serve expenses can be found on Slide 20, and subscriber acquisition costs are detailed on Slide 21, both of which can be found in the Appendix to the slide presentation.
The $92 million increase in operating expenses versus last year was driven by a $38 million or 4% increase in cost of service that supports our recurring revenue growth, $15 million in charges for legal matters booked in cost of service in the fourth quarter and a $55 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by $20 million of lower current period subscriber acquisition expenses. While direct channel gross account additions were up about 6% to 7% year-over-year on a reported actual basis, the change in mix toward ADT-owned systems reduced current period recognized SAC expenses by about $34 million.
EBITDA was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of $75 million or 5% versus fiscal 2011. EBITDA margin of 49.8% expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the $15 million in expenses for various legal-related matters incurred in the fourth quarter and normalizing for the change in mix toward ADT-owned systems, EBITDA margin was 49.7%, a 40-basis-point improvement versus prior year. If we look at EBITDA margin, excluding both the subscriber acquisition revenue and subscriber acquisition expenses that run through our P&L, our EBITDA margin for the full year was 63.2%.
Turning to Slide 10. Our full year cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion or 4% above our fiscal 2011 results. The spin-related impacts I discussed in reviewing the quarterly cash flow results also affected the full year results. While EBITDA grew by about $75 million, our operating cash flow only increased by $54 million. The cash flow benefit from the EBITDA improvement was muted by about a $50 million use of cash for core working capital due to higher inventory levels and lower trade payables.
CapEx totaled about $1.1 billion for the year, a $185 million increase over last year. $155 million of that increase was for subscriber investment, with $32 million of that attributable to the mix shift toward more ADT-owned systems. We spent an additional $30 million on IT primarily to enhance productivity and to support the split of the North American residential and commercial businesses. When we sum everything up, we generated free cash flow of $432 million for the year. Free cash flow decreased from the prior year, mainly due to higher capital investment to drive recurring revenue growth. 
At our Investor Day, I discussed why our free cash flow was not the best metric to gauge our business, as much of our capital investment drives new account growth that immediately generates revenue. On Slide 11, we provide a calculation for steady-state free cash flow that I'd like to review. We believe this metric is a better indicator of the cash flow-generation capability of our base business. In determining steady-state free cash flow, we calculate the amount in revenue that needs to be replaced to hold recurring revenue constant. We then derive the level of investment that's required to obtain that recurring revenue. The difference in CapEx is our investment for growth, which we then add back to free cash flow. On this basis, we generated $952 million in steady-state free cash flow. 
Starting at the top of the slide, you can see for this past year, we lost $486 million in recurring revenue from gross attrition. Gross attrition is calculated net of replacements contractually provided by dealers and before accounting for resale. After considering price escalations on the existing account base, we have $404 million in recurring revenue to replace. We then look at our direct channel to source that recurring revenue requirement. In the past year, we sourced 634,000 gross customer adds through our direct channel at an average new revenue per customer of $41.60, generating $316 million in annualized recurring revenue.
Since we still have an $88 million shortfall remaining, we look to our dealer channel to backfill for that. We pay our dealers a gross multiple of about 33x recurring monthly revenue or about 2.7x annual recurring revenue. So it costs us $241 million to replace the remaining revenue lost from attrition. We then reduce our annual capital expenditures for the amount of that gross investment in dealer-acquired account. That's suspending above what we needed to fully offset the revenue lost from attrition. The resulting steady-state free cash flow is $952 million. We believe this metric is a good indication of the cash flow strength of our business.
Now I'd like to focus on Slide 13, our guidance for fiscal 2013. We expect recurring revenue to continue to grow at the rate we've seen over the past several quarters at approximately 4.9% to 5.2%, with the underlying recurring revenue growth drivers being consistent with recent trends. This is at the lower end of the multi-year guidance that we provided on Investor Day.
In terms of EBITDA before items, we expect to see up to a 70-basis-point improvement in our margins versus 2012. There's a number of factors that are impacting EBITDA margin year-over-year. On the positive side, the change to more ADT-owned systems will give us the benefit of about $15 million, and we don't expect to repeat the $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that we booked this past quarter. However, we expect our total corporate costs to be about $70 million, which is $15 million higher than fiscal '12, which was largely costs allocated from Tyco.
Additionally, we'll incur dis-synergies related to the splitting of the North America residential and commercial businesses of about $40 million, which is $35 million higher than fiscal '12. Finally, we expect Hurricane Sandy will have about a $10 million negative impact mainly from the cost of incremental field service visits and incremental call center volume. In total, the impact of these items is $30 million unfavorable or about 95 basis points. We expect to mitigate that by our ongoing focus on productivity programs. 
Interest expense is expected to be about $120 million to $125 million and reflects about $20 million to $25 million from new debt we expect to incur later this year, consistent with our new leverage target, which Naren will talk about in a moment. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 38%.
Turning to cash flow. We expect a range of $375 million to $425 million in free cash flow after interest and taxes and $950 million to $1 billion in steady-state free cash flow before interest and taxes. We expect our cash tax rate to be 3% to 4%, and this rate is built into our cash flow guidance.
As Naren mentioned, we're providing longer-term guidance on our cash tax rate, as you can see here on Slide 15. We've closed out fiscal 2012 with our gross NOL at about $1.3 billion. In addition, we're changing the tax treatment of the intangible asset created when we generate accounts through our dealers. As a result, cost to generate new accounts through the ADT-authorized dealer channel will be expensed for tax purposes in the year in which the accounts are generated. This change is expected to provide onetime additional tax benefit for assets currently on the books of between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, as well as ongoing benefits for new additions. Depending on the pretax income level, utilization of the NOLs should allow us to maintain a cash tax rate of 5% to 8% from 2014 through 2019. As we will not pay Federal or state AMT this year, our tax rate will be about 3% to 4% in fiscal 2013. 
Once the NOLs are fully utilized and assuming we continue at a modest mid-single-digit growth rate, we expect the cash tax rate to move up to between 15% and 20% in 2020 and then to stabilize between 25% and 30% through 2022. Actual cash tax rate will depend on a number of items, including growth rates and profitability, sales channel mix, geographic mix of pretax income and any incremental tax planning opportunities we implement.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Naren."

As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us, and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independe",617,"Thanks, Kathy. The last topic we want to cover this morning is our capital structure. As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us, and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independent public company. We've also received input from several of our shareholders, both during the equity investor roadshow and over the course of the last 2 months. We strongly believe that our capital structure must be appropriate for both our business model and the key strategies we are pursuing. In our case, we have a business model that generates strong recurring revenues and attractive financial returns. 
In addition, our business requires an upfront cash investment to support growth, and our strategies contemplate some very exciting organic and M&A-related growth opportunities. These opportunities include the acceleration of sales of our Pulse offerings to increase the penetration of home security and position us as a leader in home automation, strengthening our presence and capabilities in the small business market and further expansion into adjacent markets like home health. These opportunities and the associated technology changes have brought some new competitors to our traditional markets, as well as these new markets. While we feel very good about our position and capabilities compared to these new competitors and peers, there is no question they also have strong capabilities, considerable scale and are very well capitalized to pursue their growth strategies in these markets. 
With this as a backdrop, we feel it is important that we maintain a capital structure that is consistent with investment-grade ratings. This will help ensure that we have reliable and affordable access to capital and the financial flexibility to support our growth strategies. Based on our discussions with the rating agencies and our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating, we have targeted an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. 
As we think about the implications of this leverage ratio on our 2013 capital allocation plans, our fundamental approach reflects discipline and balance. We intend to manage our capital in a thoughtful manner, seeking to grow long-term shareholder value by balancing the cost of debt and access to liquidity with investing for growth, organic and inorganic growth, as well as returning excess capital to shareholders in an efficient manner. Based on our EBITDA guidance and incremental debt capacity, we would have between $2.25 billion and $2.5 billion of cash available to deploy across the business. We expect to use $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion to support organic growth in our business. We've earmarked about $55 million for productivity investments, primarily IT investments to strengthen our back-office processes. We are targeting between $100 million to $150 million for bolt-on acquisitions and bulk purchases of accounts. While we expect some larger strategic acquisitions to be available to us in the future, we would evaluate the appropriate funding approach for these types of acquisitions on a case-by-case basis. Depending on actual growth rates, this would leave us $900 million to $1 billion available to return to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchase. The dividend and share repurchase plans announced this morning are consistent with this capital allocation approach. 
To wrap up our formal comments, I feel very good about the performance this quarter and our prospects for continued growth and attractive returns and for generating excess cash flow that can be deployed very efficiently over time. We are excited at the opportunities ahead of us and look forward to leveraging all of the ADT resources to drive great success as an independent public company. 
With that, we can move to our Q&A period. So I'll ask Kathryn to give you the instructions to ask questions."

That's not the only credit ratio that they use. They all use kind of handful of different ratios, and they make different adjustments. To us, that ratio is particularly constraining. And so no, our credit rating from S&P wasn't a surprise to us.

I would say that whatever it's been in the past, we're absolutely looking to improve it going forward. And our strategy is pretty simple. What we're trying to do is engage with our customers much earlier in the process, not waiting until they move and get into the new home, but building that relationship with them as soon as they've made the decision. And we're doing that through better communications with our customers upfront, but then also by engaging new partners. We've done a lot with the safe mover program, partnering with HGTV. We're also partnering with the public utilities because that tends to be an earlier call than security is and making sure that, again, we get into that process as early as possible. For those customers who are under contract within their 3-year initial contract period, there are clearly financial benefits because we do generally waive the termination costs if they pick up service at their new home. So again, that is a major focus of us, especially with a pickup in the housing market, and we expect to be successful with the programs we've put in place."

Our returns are good. Some metrics up, some metrics down. For example, our Pulse take rates in those markets tends to be better, and we believe part of that is just greater awareness of the interactive service capabilities because of the advertising they're doing. So again, I don't see a significant difference in our performance in those markets versus other markets. That's not to say that they're not making inroads. Like I said, we believe that if they are making inroads, it may not be at our expense, it may be at expense of some of the other traditional players. But the awareness is out there. They are advertising pretty substantially, and we want to make sure that we are maintaining not just our relevance in the market, but continuing to advertise and continuing to stress our market leader position and the competitive advantages that we believe we have in that marketplace with both our products, but as well as our service and our coverage."

Our Absolute -- the Absolute business had a very strong doorknocking capability. We had run some pilots on our own over the past year, and I'd say we had some success. But being able to get some scale and being able to get some strong leadership that has built and run a self-generated lead with a doorknocking sales force was important to us. So we think that it is an opportunity for us to both grow our business, but also grow our business efficiently without the significant advertising spend. I think that our self-generated sales force will have the halo effect of the advertising that we do. So there should be some benefits there. And I think it is an opportunity. The key for us is going to be making sure that we continue to have very disciplined sales process there. I mean, one of the downsides of the doorknockers is you have some players out there that have not been ethical in their business practices and this is why we wanted to have control over this channel.

And we put productivity tools in their hands also. As we've talked about in the past, we deployed iPads to all of our direct sales reps over the past year, 1.5 years, and it really does make it easier for them to sell Pulse because they can demonstrate it live and allow the customer to experience what the Pulse system does first hand. So I would say the training and that transition on the direct side has been very good. And that's reflective on the continuous increase we've seen in our take rates, and we're applying the lessons learned as we roll it out to our dealer channel. Again, we're providing the first round of training with them and -- excuse me, to them. We'll continue to work with them.

Thanks for joining us on our conference call to discuss ADT's fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2012. With me this morning are ADT's Chief Executive Officer, Naren Gursahaney; and ADT's Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Mikells. 
Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2012, which we expect to file with the SEC later today.
In the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release and accompanying slides, which are now posted on our website at adt.com, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
For those of you following on the webcast, we will be using the slide deck that you see to supplement our comments this morning. Please note that unless otherwise mentioned, references to our operating results exclude special items, and these metrics are non-GAAP measures. 
One quick housekeeping item, if I may, before we get into our formal remarks. If you recall, as part of Tyco, our fiscal 2011 included a 53rd week. This had the effect of adding an extra week of production units in last year's fourth quarter, but the impact to revenue and operating income was minimal because our revenue recognition reflects advanced billing for the entire month. 
We have a lot to cover this morning, so let me turn the call over to Naren for some opening comments."

Thank you all for joining us on our first earnings conference call as a stand-alone public company. As Craig mentioned, we've got a lot to cover this morning as we intend to review our financial results for our fiscal fourth quarter and the total year 2012, as well as discuss guidance for 2013. 
In addition, based on feedback we received during our Investor Day and roadshow, as well as subsequent discussions with several shareholders, we've included 2 important additional topics for discussion today. Kathy will provide additional details on our expectations around our cash tax rate for the next several years. Following this, I will spend a few minutes discussing our philosophy around our capital structure and capital allocation for ADT.
As you saw on our press release this morning, we declared our initial quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. In addition, our board has approved a 3-year $2 billion share repurchase program. Both of these actions were made in the context of a thoughtful capital policy that is based on our overall business strategy and the opportunities and risks we see for our business. Again, I'll discuss these in greater detail later in the call.
Our fiscal fourth quarter was another solid quarter for ADT. Total revenue during the quarter was $812 million, which represents 2.3% growth over the fourth quarter of last year, while recurring revenue grew by 5.2% to $742 million. For the full year, recurring revenue was up 5% and continued to account for 90% of our total revenue.
EBITDA during the quarter was $401 million, with an EBITDA margin of 49.4%. For the total year, we generated $1.6 billion of EBITDA, which was up approximately 5% versus the prior year. Kathy will provide some color on free cash flow comparisons and will also walk you through our steady-state free cash flow metric, which is a key performance metric we will be using going forward. EPS before special items was $0.43 for the quarter and $1.74 for the full year, both up approximately 5% over the prior year.
Our results for the quarter were in line with the updated guidance we provided during our Investor Day meeting on September 18th. These results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to grow revenues and EBITDA even as we invest to grow our business.
As we've discussed in the past, ADT operates a subscriber business model, whereby we make an investment upfront to bring on a customer and then generate our return on that investment through our monthly monitoring and service fees over the life of that customer relationship. On average, our customers stay with us for close to 7 years. 
In this model, there are 5 drivers of value creation: our ability to bring on new customers through our direct and ADT-authorized dealer channels or gross additions; the net cost of bringing on new customers, subscriber acquisition costs or SAC; the average monthly fee we collect from our customers, average revenue per customer or ARPU; the cost we incur in order to provide these services, cost to serve; and the time our customers stay with us and continue to pay the monthly fee, tenure, or the opposite, attrition. Optimizing these 5 levers allows us to grow our business profitably and generate a strong return on investment. Depending on the specific product line and channel to market, these returns average between 14% and 21%.
During the fourth quarter and throughout our fiscal year 2012, we made solid progress across several of these key value drivers. Gross adds grew by 5.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year after adjusting for the extra week we had in last year's results. For the full year, gross adds increased by 8.7% as we achieved solid growth across both our direct and dealer channels. 
Our subscriber acquisition cost per customer in our direct sales channel was up 3.8% versus last year, driven primarily by higher Pulse take rates. Our dealer channel SAC per customer was up 3.5% versus last year due to higher ARPU in that channel. 
The continued success of Pulse also helped fuel ARPU growth. In the quarter, new and resale ARPU increased by 5.7% to $42.99, while the average ARPU of our overall customer base grew by 4.4% year-over-year. For the year, new and resale ARPU increased by 3.6% to $42.02. The ARPU for new Pulse customers continues to be around $50 per month. 
The cost to serve margin on gross additions was just over 70% for the total year. This includes the impact of the legal matters we discussed at our Investor Day in September. Excluding these costs, our margin rate for the year was up slightly versus the prior year, with the higher ARPU and productivity more than offsetting the higher cost to serve associated with our Pulse offering.
During the quarter, attrition grew by 30 basis points on a quarter sequential basis to 13.8%. The majority of the increase came from voluntary disconnects, which includes the carryover of the accelerated price escalations we implemented during the second and third quarters. As we've discussed in the past, the leading driver of disconnects in our business is relocations, which makes up 35% to 40% of our disconnects. The recovery we are seeing in the housing market is expected to continue to put pressure on our attrition number. However, this should also create opportunities for new system sales or gross adds. After relocations, both voluntary and non-pay attrition each account for between 20% and 30% of our disconnects, while lost to competition accounts for the remaining 10% of the total.
In order to provide greater transparency to our overall performance in selling and installing Pulse, we've made some changes in how we calculate and report our Pulse take rates. Our new metric reflects total Pulse installations as a percentage of our total installations for the period, excluding home health, which is really only a PERS product today. This metric covers both new sales and resales in our direct residential and small business channels, as well as new sales in our dealer channel as our dealers don't participate in resales. I will also provide a total Pulse take rate that reflects the combination of our direct and indirect channels. As this change may create some comparison issues for you, I'll also provide prior period and prior year performance numbers to help address this. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the continuation of the positive growth trends in Pulse take rates. In our direct residential channel, the take rate was 23%, reflecting a 3-point improvement versus prior quarter and a 13-point improvement over the same quarter last year. Our Pulse take rate in our small business channel was 15%, which was up 4 points over the prior quarter and up 13 points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our Pulse take rate in the dealer channel was about 1%, primarily reflecting the friends and family pilots I've mentioned in the past. And we expect the dealer number to begin ramping up this quarter. In total, across all channels, 13% of our gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Pulse customers represented just under 3% of our 6.4 million customers.
Before I turn things over to Kathy, I want to mention an important event that happened subsequent to the close of our fiscal year. On October 3rd, we completed the acquisition of Absolute Security for approximately $30 million. Absolute had been an ADT-authorized dealer, with a very successful self-generated lead sales model, including a strong door-knocking capability. 
As part of this transaction, Absolute's Founder and CEO, Curtiss Weinstein, will be joining ADT's leadership team. Curtiss will report to Steve Gribbon, our Senior Vice President of Sales, and lead our newly created self-generated sales division, which we have named ADT Direct Connect. ADT Direct Connect will include the Absolute sales team, as well as the sales reps that were part of ADT's self-generated lead pilot program. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012, along with the subsequent actions we have taken, reflect the strength of our business model and our commitment to investing to grow our business while returning surplus capital to our shareholders in an efficient manner.
Now I'll turn things over to Kathy to provide some additional details on our results for the quarter and the full year."
184157327,223845402,391476,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 27, 2012",2012-11-27,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with our overall results consistent with the guidance we provided in September.",2137,"Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with our overall results consistent with the guidance we provided in September. 
Before I get started, I wanted to note a few things that impacted our results. During the third quarter, we implemented a change in our direct channel to increase the mix of our gross adds toward more ADT-owned systems rather than outright system sales. This change results in more upfront installation revenue being deferred, as well as the installation costs and commissions associated with that revenue. The change reduced nonrecurring revenue by about $19 million in the fourth quarter and $28 million for the full year. The benefit to operating income was roughly $4 million for the quarter and $6 million for the full year. The ownership mix change has virtually no impact on our overall cash flow or economic return. I also wanted to note that we incurred $15 million in charges in the quarter associated with various legal-related matters. This was consistent with the guidance that we had provided.
Now I'd like to walk through our financial performance for the quarter. Our recurring revenue grew 5.2% year-over-year to $472 million. The growth was driven by a 4% increase in average revenue per customer and a 1% increase in our average customer base. About 1/2 of the average revenue gains were due to price escalations, with the remaining 1/2 due to the richer mix from new customer addition, including those who chose our Pulse service.
Nonrecurring revenue, which includes the balance of the revenue categories you see on the slide, was down 21% year-over-year due to the mix shift toward ADT-owned systems. Total revenue was $812 million for the quarter, up 2.3%. 
Our total operating expenses before items were $634 million, up 4% or $26 million. The increase was driven by: $18 million in higher cost of service supporting our recurring revenue growth; $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that are reflected in our cost to serve expenses; and $21 million higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increased costs were partially offset by $29 million lower SAC expenses, driven primarily by the deferral of subscriber acquisition cost due to the mix shift which reduced outright system sales. 
Operating income was $178 million, down $8 million versus last year. Our operating margin was 21.9%, at the high end of our guidance.
EBITDA was $401 million this quarter, up 3%, and EBITDA margin was 49.4%, up 30 basis points from prior year. Excluding costs from legal-related matters and normalizing for the increase in ADT-owned systems, EBITDA margin would have been 49.6% or up 50 basis points from last year.
Turning to Slide 8. There was a good deal of noise in our cash flow comparisons due to the spin-off from Tyco, with prior period data presented on a carve-out basis, reflecting allocations for certain assets, liabilities and expenses. Although EBITDA for the fourth quarter was up $11 million versus prior year, our cash flow from operations decreased 9% or $34 million to $362 million. About $17 million of that negative variance is due to the allocation of certain legacy taxes made in conjunction with the spin. 
Additionally, our core working capital flipped from being a source of cash in the first -- in the fourth quarter of last year to a use of cash this year, contributing another $39 million of the negative variance. Most of that working capital variance was associated with the split from Tyco commercial security business, which artificially reduced our payable balance and inflated inventory as we no longer benefit from inventory pooling with commercial. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $281 million, with all but $17 million of that in investment spend on new subscribers. Free cash flow was $86 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our full year results on Slide 9. Recurring revenue grew 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by a 1% increase in our average account base and a 4% increase in average revenue per customer. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 5.8% due to fewer outright system sales. Total revenue of $3.2 billion increased about 4%.
Now I'm going to walk you through the full year operating expenses, so you can see how some of our direct channel subscriber acquisition costs flow through our income statement. Our total operating expenses were $2.5 billion, up about 4% versus prior year. Our total operating expenses were mainly comprised of $943 million for cost of service, $523 million for gross subscriber acquisition cost and $982 million for depreciation and amortization. Details of our cost to serve expenses can be found on Slide 20, and subscriber acquisition costs are detailed on Slide 21, both of which can be found in the Appendix to the slide presentation.
The $92 million increase in operating expenses versus last year was driven by a $38 million or 4% increase in cost of service that supports our recurring revenue growth, $15 million in charges for legal matters booked in cost of service in the fourth quarter and a $55 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by $20 million of lower current period subscriber acquisition expenses. While direct channel gross account additions were up about 6% to 7% year-over-year on a reported actual basis, the change in mix toward ADT-owned systems reduced current period recognized SAC expenses by about $34 million.
EBITDA was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of $75 million or 5% versus fiscal 2011. EBITDA margin of 49.8% expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the $15 million in expenses for various legal-related matters incurred in the fourth quarter and normalizing for the change in mix toward ADT-owned systems, EBITDA margin was 49.7%, a 40-basis-point improvement versus prior year. If we look at EBITDA margin, excluding both the subscriber acquisition revenue and subscriber acquisition expenses that run through our P&L, our EBITDA margin for the full year was 63.2%.
Turning to Slide 10. Our full year cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion or 4% above our fiscal 2011 results. The spin-related impacts I discussed in reviewing the quarterly cash flow results also affected the full year results. While EBITDA grew by about $75 million, our operating cash flow only increased by $54 million. The cash flow benefit from the EBITDA improvement was muted by about a $50 million use of cash for core working capital due to higher inventory levels and lower trade payables.
CapEx totaled about $1.1 billion for the year, a $185 million increase over last year. $155 million of that increase was for subscriber investment, with $32 million of that attributable to the mix shift toward more ADT-owned systems. We spent an additional $30 million on IT primarily to enhance productivity and to support the split of the North American residential and commercial businesses. When we sum everything up, we generated free cash flow of $432 million for the year. Free cash flow decreased from the prior year, mainly due to higher capital investment to drive recurring revenue growth. 
At our Investor Day, I discussed why our free cash flow was not the best metric to gauge our business, as much of our capital investment drives new account growth that immediately generates revenue. On Slide 11, we provide a calculation for steady-state free cash flow that I'd like to review. We believe this metric is a better indicator of the cash flow-generation capability of our base business. In determining steady-state free cash flow, we calculate the amount of revenue that needs to be replaced to hold recurring revenue constant. We then derive the level of investment that's required to obtain that recurring revenue. The difference in CapEx is our investment for growth, which we then add back to free cash flow. On this basis, we generated $952 million in steady-state free cash flow. 
Starting at the top of the slide, you can see for this past year, we lost $486 million in recurring revenue from gross attrition. Gross attrition is calculated net of replacements contractually provided by dealers and before accounting for resale. After considering price escalations on the existing account base, we have $404 million in recurring revenue to replace. We then look at our direct channel to source that recurring revenue requirement. In the past year, we sourced 634,000 gross customer adds through our direct channel at an average new revenue per customer of $41.60, generating $316 million in annualized recurring revenue.
Since we still have an $88 million shortfall remaining, we look to our dealer channel to backfill for that. We pay our dealers a gross multiple of about 33x recurring monthly revenue or about 2.7x annual recurring revenue. So it costs us $241 million to replace the remaining revenue lost from attrition. We then reduce our annual capital expenditures for the amount of that gross investment in dealer-acquired account. That's for spending above what we needed to fully offset the revenue lost from attrition. The resulting steady-state free cash flow is $952 million. We believe this metric is a good indication of the cash flow strength of our business.
Now I'd like to focus on Slide 13, our guidance for fiscal 2013. We expect recurring revenue to continue to grow at the rate we've seen over the past several quarters, at approximately 4.9% to 5.2%, with the underlying recurring revenue growth drivers being consistent with recent trends. This is at the lower end of the multiyear guidance that we provided on Investor Day.
In terms of EBITDA before items, we expect to see up to a 70-basis-point improvement in our margins versus 2012. There's a number of factors that are impacting EBITDA margin year-over-year. On the positive side, the change to more ADT-owned systems will give us a benefit of about $15 million, and we don't expect to repeat the $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that we booked this past quarter. However, we expect our total corporate costs to be about $70 million, which is $15 million higher than fiscal '12, which was largely costs allocated from Tyco.
Additionally, we'll incur dis-synergies related to the splitting of the North America residential and commercial businesses of about $40 million, which is $35 million higher than fiscal '12. Finally, we expect Hurricane Sandy will have about a $10 million negative impact mainly from the cost of incremental field service visits and incremental call center volume. In total, the impact of these items is $30 million unfavorable or about 95 basis points. We expect to mitigate that by our ongoing focus on productivity programs. 
Interest expense is expected to be about $120 million to $125 million and reflects about $20 million to $25 million from new debt we expect to incur later this year, consistent with our new leverage target, which Naren will talk about in a moment. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 38%.
Turning to cash flow. We expect a range of $375 million to $425 million in free cash flow after interest and taxes, and $950 million to $1 billion in steady-state free cash flow before interest and taxes. We expect our cash tax rate to be 3% to 4%, and this rate is built into our cash flow guidance.
As Naren mentioned, we're providing longer-term guidance on our cash tax rate, as you can see here on Slide 15. We closed out fiscal 2012 with our gross NOL at about $1.3 billion. In addition, we're changing the tax treatment of the intangible asset created when we generate accounts through our dealers. As a result, cost to generate new accounts through the ADT-authorized dealer channel will be expensed for tax purposes in the year in which the accounts are generated. This change is expected to provide onetime additional tax benefit for assets currently on the books of between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, as well as ongoing benefits for new additions. Depending on the pretax income level, utilization of the NOLs should allow us to maintain a cash tax rate of 5% to 8% from 2014 through 2019. As we will not pay Federal or state AMT this year, our tax rate will be about 3% to 4% in fiscal 2013. 
Once the NOLs are fully utilized and assuming we continue at a modest mid-single-digit growth rate, we expect the cash tax rate to move up to between 15% and 20% in 2020 and then to stabilize between 25% and 30% through 2022. Actual cash tax rate will depend on a number of items, including growth rates and profitability, sales channel mix, geographic mix of pretax income and any incremental tax planning opportunities we implement.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Naren."

As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us, and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independe",617,"Thanks, Kathy. The last topic we want to cover this morning is our capital structure. As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us, and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independent public company. We've also received input from several of our shareholders, both during the equity investor roadshow and over the course of the last 2 months. We strongly believe that our capital structure must be appropriate for both our business model and the key strategies we are pursuing. In our case, we have a business model that generates strong recurring revenues and attractive financial returns. 
In addition, our business requires an upfront cash investment to support growth, and our strategies contemplate some very exciting organic and M&A-related growth opportunities. These opportunities include the acceleration of sales of our Pulse offerings to increase the penetration of home security and position us as a leader in home automation, strengthening our presence and capabilities in the small business market and further expansion into adjacent markets like home health. These opportunities and the associated technology changes have brought some new competitors to our traditional markets, as well as these new markets. While we feel very good about our position and capabilities compared to these new competitors and peers, there is no question they also have strong capabilities, considerable scale and are very well capitalized to pursue their growth strategies in these markets. 
With this as a backdrop, we feel it is important that we maintain a capital structure that is consistent with investment-grade ratings. This will help ensure that we have reliable and affordable access to capital and the financial flexibility to support our growth strategies. Based on our discussions with the rating agencies and our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating, we have targeted an unadjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. 
As we think about the implications of this leverage ratio on our 2013 capital allocation plans, our fundamental approach reflects discipline and balance. We intend to manage our capital in a thoughtful manner, seeking to grow long-term shareholder value by balancing the cost of debt and access to liquidity with investing for growth, organic and inorganic growth, as well as returning excess capital to shareholders in an efficient manner. 
Based on our EBITDA guidance and incremental debt capacity, we would have between $2.25 billion and $2.5 billion of cash available to deploy across the business. We expect to use $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion to support organic growth in our business. We've earmarked about $55 million for productivity investments, primarily IT investments to strengthen our back-office processes. We are targeting between $100 million to $150 million for bolt-on acquisitions and bulk purchases of accounts. While we expect some larger strategic acquisitions to be available to us in the future, we would evaluate the appropriate funding approach for these types of acquisitions on a case-by-case basis. Depending on actual growth rates, this would leave us $900 million to $1 billion available to return to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchase. The dividend and share repurchase plans announced this morning are consistent with this capital allocation approach. 
To wrap up our formal comments, I feel very good about the performance this quarter and our prospects for continued growth and attractive returns and for generating excess cash flow that can be deployed very efficiently over time. We are excited at the opportunities ahead of us and look forward to leveraging all of the ADT resources to drive great success as an independent public company. 
With that, we can move to our Q&A period. So I'll ask Kathryn to give you the instructions to ask questions."

At the same time, I do think we've got tremendous growth upside on the small business channel where our take rates are still relatively low. And I think the offerings, particularly, as we continue to refine them, will be even more attractive for small-business customers. And then, as we've talked about in the past, we should now start to see a healthy ramp-up in the dealer channel that really is, in earnest, pushing hard starting this quarter."

So we would lose the customer as they move out of a home that has an ADT system and then potentially capture them as they move to a new home, assuming they do invest in a security system. And I would hope that, while we have 25% of the installed base, I would hope that we could do even better as a percentage of gross adds as we continue to refine both our products and drive improvements in our selling process.

We're also partnering with the public utilities because that tends to be a earlier call than security is and making sure that, again, we get into that process as early as possible. For those customers who are under contract within their 3-year initial contract period, there are clearly financial benefits because we do generally waive the termination costs if they pick up service at their new home.

So we think that it is an opportunity for us to both grow our business, but also grow our business efficiently without the significant advertising spend. I think that our self-generated sales force will have the halo effect of the advertising that we do. So there should be some benefits there. And I think it is an opportunity. The key for us is going to be making sure that we continue to have very disciplined sales process there.

As we've talked about in the past, we deployed iPads to all of our direct sales reps over the past year, 1.5 years, and it really does make it easier for them to sell Pulse because they can demonstrate it live and allow the customer to experience what the Pulse system does first hand.

And that's reflective on the continuous increase we've seen in our take rates, and we're applying the lessons learned as we roll it out to our dealer channel.

Thanks for joining us on our conference call to discuss ADT's fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2012. With me this morning are ADT's Chief Executive Officer, Naren Gursahaney; and ADT's Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Mikells. 
Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2012, which we expect to file with the SEC later today.
In the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release and accompanying slides, which are now posted on our website at adt.com, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
For those of you following on the webcast, we will be using the slide deck that you see to supplement our comments this morning. Please note that unless otherwise mentioned, references to our operating results exclude special items, and these metrics are non-GAAP measures. 
One quick housekeeping item, if I may, before we get into our formal remarks. If you recall, as part of Tyco, our fiscal 2011 included a 53rd week. This had the effect of adding an extra week of production units in last year's fourth quarter, but the impact to revenue and operating income was minimal because our revenue recognition reflects advanced billing for the entire month. 
We have a lot to cover this morning, so let me turn the call over to Naren for some opening comments."

Thank you all for joining us on our first earnings conference call as a stand-alone public company. As Craig mentioned, we've got a lot to cover this morning as we intend to review our financial results for our fiscal fourth quarter and the total year 2012, as well as discuss guidance for 2013. 
In addition, based on feedback we received during our Investor Day and roadshow, as well as subsequent discussions with several shareholders, we've included 2 important additional topics for discussion today. Kathy will provide additional details on our expectations around our cash tax rate for the next several years. Following this, I will spend a few minutes discussing our philosophy around our capital structure and capital allocation for ADT.
As you saw on our press release this morning, we declared our initial quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. In addition, our board has approved a 3-year $2 billion share repurchase program. Both of these actions were made in the context of a thoughtful capital policy that is based on our overall business strategy and the opportunities and risks we see for our business. Again, I'll discuss these in greater detail later in the call.
Our fiscal fourth quarter was another solid quarter for ADT. Total revenue during the quarter was $812 million, which represents 2.3% growth over the fourth quarter of last year, while recurring revenue grew by 5.2% to $742 million. For the full year, recurring revenue was up 5% and continued to account for 90% of our total revenue.
EBITDA during the quarter was $401 million, with an EBITDA margin of 49.4%. For the total year, we generated $1.6 billion of EBITDA, which was up approximately 5% versus the prior year. Kathy will provide some color on free cash flow comparisons and will also walk you through our steady-state free cash flow metric, which is a key performance metric we will be using going forward. EPS before special items was $0.43 for the quarter and $1.74 for the full year, both up approximately 5% over the prior year.
Our results for the quarter were in line with the updated guidance we provided during our Investor Day meeting on September 18th. These results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to grow revenues and EBITDA even as we invest to grow our business.
As we've discussed in the past, ADT operates a subscriber business model, whereby we make an investment upfront to bring on a customer and then generate our return on that investment through our monthly monitoring and service fees over the life of that customer relationship. On average, our customers stay with us for close to 7 years. 
In this model, there are 5 drivers of value creation: our ability to bring on new customers through our direct and ADT-authorized dealer channels or gross additions; the net cost of bringing on new customers, subscriber acquisition costs or SAC; the average monthly fee we collect from our customers, average revenue per customer or ARPU; the cost we incur in order to provide these services, cost to serve; and the time our customers stay with us and continue to pay the monthly fee, tenure, or the opposite, attrition. Optimizing these 5 levers allows us to grow our business profitably and generate a strong return on investment. Depending on the specific product line and channel to market, these returns average between 14% and 21%.
During the fourth quarter and throughout our fiscal year 2012, we made solid progress across several of these key value drivers. Gross adds grew by 5.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year after adjusting for the extra week we had in last year's results. For the full year, gross adds increased by 8.7% as we achieved solid growth across both our direct and dealer channels. 
Our subscriber acquisition cost per customer in our direct sales channel was up 3.8% versus last year, driven primarily by higher Pulse take rates. Our dealer channel SAC per customer was up 3.5% versus last year due to higher ARPU in that channel. 
The continued success of Pulse also helped fuel ARPU growth. In the quarter, new and resale ARPU increased by 5.7% to $42.99, while the average ARPU of our overall customer base grew by 4.4% year-over-year. For the year, new and resale ARPU increased by 3.6% to $42.02. The ARPU for new Pulse customers continues to be around $50 per month. 
The cost to serve margin on gross additions was just over 70% for the total year. This includes the impact of the legal matters we discussed at our Investor Day in September. Excluding these costs, our margin rate for the year was up slightly versus the prior year, with the higher ARPU and productivity more than offsetting the higher cost to serve associated with our Pulse offering.
During the quarter, attrition grew by 30 basis points on a quarter sequential basis to 13.8%. The majority of the increase came from voluntary disconnects, which includes the carryover of the accelerated price escalations we implemented during the second and third quarters. As we've discussed in the past, the leading driver of disconnects in our business is relocations, which makes up 35% to 40% of our disconnects. The recovery we are seeing in the housing market is expected to continue to put pressure on our attrition number. However, this should also create opportunities for new system sales or gross adds. After relocations, both voluntary and non-pay attrition each account for between 20% and 30% of our disconnects, while lost to competition accounts for the remaining 10% of the total.
In order to provide greater transparency to our overall performance in selling and installing Pulse, we've made some changes in how we calculate and report our Pulse take rates. Our new metric reflects total Pulse installations as a percentage of our total installations for the period, excluding home health, which is really only a PERS product today. This metric covers both new sales and resales in our direct residential and small business channels, as well as new sales in our dealer channel as our dealers don't participate in resales. I will also provide a total Pulse take rate that reflects the combination of our direct and indirect channels. As this change may create some comparison issues for you, I'll also provide prior period and prior year performance numbers to help address this. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the continuation of the positive growth trends in Pulse take rates. In our direct residential channel, the take rate was 23%, reflecting a 3-point improvement versus prior quarter and a 13-point improvement over the same quarter last year. Our Pulse take rate in our small business channel was 15%, which was up 4 points over the prior quarter and up 13 points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our Pulse take rate in the dealer channel was about 1%, primarily reflecting the friends and family pilots I've mentioned in the past. And we expect the dealer number to begin ramping up this quarter. In total, across all channels, 13% of our gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Pulse customers represented just under 3% of our 6.4 million customers.
Before I turn things over to Kathy, I want to mention an important event that happened subsequent to the close of our fiscal year. On October 3rd, we completed the acquisition of Absolute Security for approximately $30 million. Absolute had been an ADT-authorized dealer, with a very successful self-generated lead sales model, including a strong door-knocking capability. 
As part of this transaction, Absolute's Founder and CEO, Curtiss Weinstein, will be joining ADT's leadership team. Curtiss will report to Steve Gribbon, our Senior Vice President of Sales, and lead our newly created self-generated sales division, which we have named ADT Direct Connect. ADT Direct Connect will include the Absolute sales team, as well as the sales reps that were part of ADT's self-generated lead pilot program. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012, along with the subsequent actions we have taken, reflect the strength of our business model and our commitment to investing to grow our business while returning surplus capital to our shareholders in an efficient manner.
Now I'll turn things over to Kathy to provide some additional details on our results for the quarter and the full year."
184157327,223845402,392604,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 27, 2012",2012-11-27,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with our overall results consistent with the guidance we provided in September.",2137,"Thanks, Naren, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, you can see that we had a solid quarter with respect to growth in recurring revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, with our overall results consistent with the guidance we provided in September. 
Before I get started, I wanted to note a few things that impacted our results. During the third quarter, we implemented a change in our direct channel to increase the mix of our gross adds toward more ADT-owned systems rather than outright system sales. This change results in more upfront installation revenue being deferred, as well as the installation costs and commissions associated with that revenue. The change reduced nonrecurring revenue by about $19 million in the fourth quarter and $28 million for the full year. The benefit to operating income was roughly $4 million for the quarter and $6 million for the full year. The ownership mix change has virtually no impact on our overall cash flow or economic return. I also wanted to note that we incurred $15 million in charges in the quarter associated with various legal-related matters. This was consistent with the guidance that we had provided.
Now I'd like to walk through our financial performance for the quarter. Our recurring revenue grew 5.2% year-over-year to $472 million. The growth was driven by a 4% increase in average revenue per customer and a 1% increase in our average customer base. About half of the average revenue gains were due to price escalations, with the remaining half due to the richer mix from new customer addition, including those who chose our Pulse service.
Nonrecurring revenue, which includes the balance of the revenue categories you see on the slide, was down 21% year-over-year due to the mix shift toward ADT-owned systems. Total revenue was $812 million for the quarter, up 2.3%. 
Our total operating expenses before items were $634 million, up 4% or $26 million. The increase was driven by: $18 million in higher cost of service supporting our recurring revenue growth; $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that are reflected in our cost to serve expenses; and $21 million higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increased costs were partially offset by $29 million lower SAC expenses, driven primarily by the deferral of subscriber acquisition cost due to the mix shift which reduced outright system sales. 
Operating income was $178 million, down $8 million versus last year. Our operating margin was 21.9%, at the high end of our guidance.
EBITDA was $401 million this quarter, up 3%, and EBITDA margin was 49.4%, up 30 basis points from prior year. Excluding costs from legal-related matters and normalizing for the increase in ADT-owned systems, EBITDA margin would have been 49.6% or up 50 basis points from last year.
Turning to Slide 8. There was a good deal of noise in our cash flow comparisons due to the spin-off from Tyco, with prior period data presented on a carve-out basis, reflecting allocations for certain assets, liabilities and expenses. Although EBITDA for the fourth quarter was up $11 million versus prior year, our cash flow from operations decreased 9% or $34 million to $362 million. About $17 million of that negative variance is due to the allocation of certain legacy taxes made in conjunction with the spin. 
Additionally, our core working capital flipped from being a source of cash in the first -- in the fourth quarter of last year to a use of cash this year, contributing another $39 million of the negative variance. Most of that working capital variance was associated with the split from Tyco commercial security business, which artificially reduced our payable balance and inflated inventory as we no longer benefit from inventory pooling with commercial. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $281 million, with all but $17 million of that in investment spend on new subscribers. Free cash flow was $86 million for the quarter. 
Turning to our full year results on Slide 9. Recurring revenue grew 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by a 1% increase in our average account base and a 4% increase in average revenue per customer. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 5.8% due to fewer outright system sales. Total revenue of $3.2 billion increased about 4%.
Now I'm going to walk you through the full year operating expenses, so you can see how some of our direct channel subscriber acquisition costs flow through our income statement. Our total operating expenses were $2.5 billion, up about 4% versus prior year. Our total operating expenses were mainly comprised of $943 million for cost of service, $523 million for gross subscriber acquisition cost and $982 million for depreciation and amortization. Details of our cost to serve expenses can be found on Slide 20, and subscriber acquisition costs are detailed on Slide 21, both of which can be found in the Appendix to the slide presentation.
The $92 million increase in operating expenses versus last year was driven by a $38 million or 4% increase in cost of service that supports our recurring revenue growth, $15 million in charges for legal matters booked in cost of service in the fourth quarter and a $55 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by $20 million of lower current period subscriber acquisition expenses. While direct channel gross account additions were up about 6% to 7% year-over-year on a reported actual basis, the change in mix toward ADT-owned systems reduced current period recognized SAC expenses by about $34 million.
EBITDA was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of $75 million or 5% versus fiscal 2011. EBITDA margin of 49.8% expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the $15 million in expenses for various legal-related matters incurred in the fourth quarter and normalizing for the change in mix toward ADT-owned systems, EBITDA margin was 49.7%, a 40-basis-point improvement versus prior year. If we look at EBITDA margin, excluding both the subscriber acquisition revenue and subscriber acquisition expenses that run through our P&L, our EBITDA margin for the full year was 63.2%.
Turning to Slide 10. Our full year cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion or 4% above our fiscal 2011 results. The spin-related impacts I discussed in reviewing the quarterly cash flow results also affected the full year results. While EBITDA grew by about $75 million, our operating cash flow only increased by $54 million. The cash flow benefit from the EBITDA improvement was muted by about a $50 million use of cash for core working capital due to higher inventory levels and lower trade payables.
CapEx totaled about $1.1 billion for the year, a $185 million increase over last year. $155 million of that increase was for subscriber investment, with $32 million of that attributable to the mix shift toward more ADT-owned systems. We spent an additional $30 million on IT primarily to enhance productivity and to support the split of the North American residential and commercial businesses. When we sum everything up, we generated free cash flow of $432 million for the year. Free cash flow decreased from the prior year, mainly due to higher capital investment to drive recurring revenue growth. 
At our Investor Day, I discussed why our free cash flow was not the best metric to gauge our business, as much of our capital investment drives new account growth that immediately generates revenue. On Slide 11, we provide a calculation for steady-state free cash flow that I'd like to review. We believe this metric is a better indicator of the cash flow-generation capability of our base business. In determining steady-state free cash flow, we calculate the amount of revenue that needs to be replaced to hold recurring revenue constant. We then derive the level of investment that's required to obtain that recurring revenue. The difference in CapEx is our investment for growth, which we then add back to free cash flow. On this basis, we generated $952 million in steady-state free cash flow. 
Starting at the top of the slide, you can see for this past year, we lost $486 million in recurring revenue from gross attrition. Gross attrition is calculated net of replacements contractually provided by dealers and before accounting for resale. After considering price escalations on the existing account base, we have $404 million in recurring revenue to replace. We then look at our direct channel to source that recurring revenue requirement. In the past year, we sourced 634,000 gross customer adds through our direct channel at an average new revenue per customer of $41.60, generating $316 million in annualized recurring revenue.
Since we still have an $88 million shortfall remaining, we look to our dealer channel to backfill for that. We pay our dealers a gross multiple of about 33x recurring monthly revenue or about 2.7x annual recurring revenue. So it costs us $241 million to replace the remaining revenue lost from attrition. We then reduce our annual capital expenditures for the amount of that gross investment in dealer-acquired account. That's for spending above what we needed to fully offset the revenue lost from attrition. The resulting steady-state free cash flow is $952 million. We believe this metric is a good indication of the cash flow strength of our business.
Now I'd like to focus on Slide 13, our guidance for fiscal 2013. We expect recurring revenue to continue to grow at the rate we've seen over the past several quarters, at approximately 4.9% to 5.2%, with the underlying recurring revenue growth drivers being consistent with recent trends. This is at the lower end of the multiyear guidance that we provided on Investor Day.
In terms of EBITDA before items, we expect to see up to a 70-basis-point improvement in our margins versus 2012. There's a number of factors that are impacting EBITDA margin year-over-year. On the positive side, the change to more ADT-owned systems will give us a benefit of about $15 million, and we don't expect to repeat the $15 million in charges for legal-related matters that we booked this past quarter. However, we expect our total corporate costs to be about $70 million, which is $15 million higher than fiscal '12, which was largely costs allocated from Tyco.
Additionally, we'll incur dis-synergies related to the splitting of the North America residential and commercial businesses of about $40 million, which is $35 million higher than fiscal '12. Finally, we expect Hurricane Sandy will have about a $10 million negative impact mainly from the cost of incremental field service visits and incremental call center volume. In total, the impact of these items is $30 million unfavorable or about 95 basis points. We expect to mitigate that by our ongoing focus on productivity programs. 
Interest expense is expected to be about $120 million to $125 million and reflects about $20 million to $25 million from new debt we expect to incur later this year, consistent with our new leverage target, which Naren will talk about in a moment. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 36% and 38%.
Turning to cash flow. We expect a range of $375 million to $425 million in free cash flow after interest and taxes, and $950 million to $1 billion in steady-state free cash flow before interest and taxes. We expect our cash tax rate to be 3% to 4%, and this rate is built into our cash flow guidance.
As Naren mentioned, we're providing longer-term guidance on our cash tax rate, as you can see here on Slide 15. We closed out fiscal 2012 with our gross NOL at about $1.3 billion. In addition, we're changing the tax treatment of the intangible asset created when we generate accounts through our dealers. As a result, cost to generate new accounts through the ADT-authorized dealer channel will be expensed for tax purposes in the year in which the accounts are generated. This change is expected to provide onetime additional tax benefit for assets currently on the books of between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, as well as ongoing benefits for new additions. Depending on the pretax income level, utilization of the NOLs should allow us to maintain a cash tax rate of 5% to 8% from 2014 through 2019. As we will not pay Federal or state AMT this year, our tax rate will be about 3% to 4% in fiscal 2013. 
Once the NOLs are fully utilized and assuming we continue at a modest mid-single-digit growth rate, we expect the cash tax rate to move up to between 15% and 20% in 2020 and then to stabilize between 25% and 30% through 2022. Actual cash tax rate will depend on a number of items, including growth rates and profitability, sales channel mix, geographic mix of pretax income and any incremental tax planning opportunities we implement.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Naren."

The last topic we want to cover this morning is our capital structure. As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us, and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independe",617,"Thanks, Kathy. The last topic we want to cover this morning is our capital structure. As I'm sure you can appreciate, this is an important topic for us, and management and our new board have spent considerable time on it even before we became an independent public company. We've also received input from several of our shareholders, both during the equity investor roadshow and over the course of the last 2 months. We strongly believe that our capital structure must be appropriate for both our business model and the key strategies we are pursuing. In our case, we have a business model that generates strong recurring revenues and attractive financial returns. 
In addition, our business requires an upfront cash investment to support growth, and our strategies contemplate some very exciting organic and M&A-related growth opportunities. These opportunities include the acceleration of sales of our Pulse offerings to increase the penetration of home security and position us as a leader in home automation, strengthening our presence and capabilities in the small business market and further expansion into adjacent markets like home health. These opportunities and the associated technology changes have brought some new competitors to our traditional markets, as well as these new markets. While we feel very good about our position and capabilities compared to these new competitors and peers, there is no question they also have strong capabilities, considerable scale and are very well capitalized to pursue their growth strategies in these markets. 
With this as a backdrop, we feel it is important that we maintain a capital structure that is consistent with investment-grade ratings. This will help ensure that we have reliable and affordable access to capital and the financial flexibility to support our growth strategies. Based on our discussions with the rating agencies and our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating, we have targeted an unadjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. 
As we think about the implications of this leverage ratio on our 2013 capital allocation plans, our fundamental approach reflects discipline and balance. We intend to manage our capital in a thoughtful manner, seeking to grow long-term shareholder value by balancing the cost of debt and access to liquidity with investing for growth, organic and inorganic growth, as well as returning excess capital to shareholders in an efficient manner. 
Based on our EBITDA guidance and incremental debt capacity, we would have between $2.25 billion and $2.5 billion of cash available to deploy across the business. We expect to use $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion to support organic growth in our business. We've earmarked about $55 million for productivity investments, primarily IT investments to strengthen our back-office processes. We are targeting between $100 million to $150 million for bolt-on acquisitions and bulk purchases of accounts. While we expect some larger strategic acquisitions to be available to us in the future, we would evaluate the appropriate funding approach for these types of acquisitions on a case-by-case basis. Depending on actual growth rates, this would leave us $900 million to $1 billion available to return to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchase. The dividend and share repurchase plans announced this morning are consistent with this capital allocation approach. 
To wrap up our formal comments, I feel very good about the performance this quarter and our prospects for continued growth and attractive returns and for generating excess cash flow that can be deployed very efficiently over time. We are excited at the opportunities ahead of us and look forward to leveraging all of the ADT resources to drive great success as an independent public company. 
With that, we can move to our Q&A period. So I'll ask Kathryn to give you the instructions to ask questions."

Just looking at the guidance for '13, it looks like you'll return about $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

As we've talked about in the past, we deployed iPads to all of our direct sales reps over the past year, 1.5 years, and it really does make it easier for them to sell Pulse because they can demonstrate it live and allow the customer to experience what the Pulse system does first hand.

Clearly, level of leverage is a key consideration to the rating agencies. And in terms of the credit rating itself, they take a number of different metrics into consideration. We also took all of that into consideration in determining what we thought the right leverage target was. And in taking that into consideration, we certainly did so in believing that we'll be able to maintain investment-grade ratings, and that's important to us."

When ADT spun off, I assume that Tyco and your management team put a great deal of thought into the capital structure and the debt balance at the time of the bond deal, which was 5 months ago.

The decision to have us come out where we did with the $2.5 billion of growth debt was, one, again, the commitment there to remain investment-grade, but also to leave some flexibility for the new board and the new management team to determine the appropriate long-term structure for the business. So that said, I don't see a major departure from what was contemplated and what was discussed there versus where we're going. I think we're acknowledging the fact that we've got a business model that does generate good strong cash flows. We felt we did have some additional capacity out there.
