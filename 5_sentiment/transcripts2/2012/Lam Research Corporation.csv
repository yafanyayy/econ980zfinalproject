30655,145849549,210808,"Lam Research Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Shayne, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint for the guidance ranges of the December quarter on all financial metrics. In calendar year 2011, Lam deliver",896,"Thank you, Shayne, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint for the guidance ranges of the December quarter on all financial metrics. In calendar year 2011, Lam delivered $2.8 billion of revenue, generated $696 million in cash from operations or for, representing 25% of revenues and returned approximately $233 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases.
Moving now to the specifics for the quarter ended December 25, shipments were $563 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range and down 3% from the September quarter. Application market segment breakdown for the quarter were as follows: Application the 45-nanometer and below represented 90% of overall system shipments and we further estimated about 87% of our quarterly shipments were targeted for applications below the 4x technology note. 
System shipments for the memory segment were 42% of the overall total and included NAND at 28% and DRAM at 14% of total system shipments. Foundry shipments were 46% of total system shipments while logic and other positive to the balance at 12%. 
I'd like to note the beginning of the December quarter we made a change for market segment reporting methodology for shipments. Previously our foundry numbers included only pure play foundries. Starting with this quarter and going forward, we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic and other category.
December quarter revenues were approximately $584 million, representing a sequential decrease of 14% and coming in better than the midpoint of our expected range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.1% down from 41.7% in the September quarter and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. 
In addition to product mix, our gross margin performance for the quarter was primarily affected by reduced factory and field utilization rates correlated to the lower revenue levels. December quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $180 million, down about $2 million sequentially. Versus the September quarter, we had lower levels of variable compensation reflecting lower overall business levels. 
As we highlighted last quarter, our exiting December mantra rate was on an upper trajectory, which we expect to continue in a manner consistent with prior commentary relative to the need for increased levels of headquarters and customer facing research and development. Non-GAAP operating income was $54 million versus $101 million in the September quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2% above the high end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter was 21.8%. Higher than we had anticipated due to geographic income mix. 
As we previously outlined, our tax rate is highly dependent on our U.S. versus non-U.S. income mix. For fiscal tax share planning services we make certain assumptions on geographic income mix and overall profitability levels and actual results may vary from those assumptions. Going forward, we would expect an overall fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP tax rate in the high teens to low-20% range. This fiscal year rate includes only a 2-quarter benefit from the R&D tax credit which expires December 2011. 
Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, December quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.34 at the high-end of our guidance range for the quarter. The higher tax rate negatively affected our EPS by about $0.02 in the quarter and to the fact that we suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the contemplation of the Novellus transaction. 
Moving to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments totaled $2.4 billion versus $2.2 billion last quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $169 million in cash from operations, up $82 million sequentially. DSO for the quarter were 72 days, up from 70 days in the September quarter, primarily reflecting collection timing differences due to the year end cutoff. 
Inventory turns were 3.7, down from the September quarter end performance of 4.0, largely due to declines in September quarter output levels. We exited the December quarter with deferred revenues of $192 million, up from $181 million in the September quarter and as usual this excludes shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. In December, the revenue value for the shipments totaled approximately $16 million. Non-cash expenses include among other items, $18 million for equity compensation and $22 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $27 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,850 regular full-time employees. 
As a reminder, in December we announced our new share repurchase Opera authorization of $1.6 billion which were placed to our prior authorization and which is expected to be completed within 1 year of the closing of our merger with Novellus. During the December quarter, due to deal related restrictions, our trading activity was very limited. We repurchased approximately $10.6 million of our common stock at an average price of $39 per share and in addition, we settled a $100 million structured repurchase program and received 2.6 million shares. This structured repurchase program was previously discussed on our September quarter conference call. 
Due to the Novellus transaction, we will have only a short open trading window within the March quarter and we intend to execute repurchases during that open window. 
I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."

Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transitioned of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the No",1656,"Thank you, Ernie. Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transitioned of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the Novellus acquisition announcement, it is a pleasure to reengage with the investment community and together with the rest of the Lam team I look forward to working with you prospectively. The wafer fab equipment industry has never been known for its predictability and 2011 was no exception. The macroeconomic environments remain volatile highlighted by the European debt crisis slowing growth in Asia and of course sluggish performance here in the U.S. In addition, catastrophes and that Japan and Thailand great a significant disruptions in the consumer electronics and PC supply chain combined, this environment cost our customers to be incrementally more cautious despite relatively robust demand for smartphones, tablets and other devices in the year. For the equipment market, spending for the second half of 2011 was lower than the first half by double-digit percentage and was focused almost entirely on leading edge migrations which include 30 to 28-nanometer expansion for the foundries, 3x and 2x conversation for DRAM and 2x  and 2y node capacity additions for NAND. We believed that wafer fabrication spending for the year was a healthy $31 billion to $32 billion, up about 9% from 2010. 
As previously communicated, for Lam specifically the combination of customer mix and spending patterns resulted in Lam's served markets declining on a year-over-year basis. Notably microprocessor investments represented nearly 20% of overall spend in 2011 compared with approximately 11% in 2010. Additionally, the profiler equipment purchased for leading edge foundry and logic capacity resulted in expending towards the low end of its historical range at roughly 12% to 12.5% of overall wafer fabrication spending compared with a high 13% range in 2010. 
With this context, we believe our shift market share performance for 2011 to be in the upper 40s percentage range for etch and the lower 20s percentage range for single-wafer clean. The headline being a relatively neutral year for the company in this metric. 
On application share basis which is indicative of forward-looking market share momentum, we anticipate positive gains in etch through and plus 1 with 13 new application wins in 2011 primarily in critical front end of line memory and foundry. More successes than not depending positions and the benefit of the transition to conductor etch associated with various patterning and metal hard mask processing schemes. This performance extends to 11 years our track record as the global market share leader in etch. 
In single-wafer clean, we believe we gained 10 new applications and successfully defended our existing positions. Both the new and defended applications are in areas where we currently hold strong positions and have demonstrated differentiated results. These include back end of line applications and those targeted for the backside of the wafer. We also continue to gain traction on the area of fine aspect ratio cleans where our DRAM technology has demonstrated advantage. As we talked about in recent quarters, this is a time of significant critical technology and productivity challenges for our customers and Lam remains strongly committed to making the necessary R&D investments to address those needs. We believe that this commitment will be recognized with the opportunity to gain share on an ongoing basis and continue to target of 3 to 5 percentage share gain in etch and 5 and 10 percentage share again in single-wafer clean over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Specific 2012 focus areas for the company include the expansion of double patterning steps for 14-nanometer logic node, quadruple patterning for 2y DRAM devices, 14-nanometer thin set architectures and  3d NAND structures. We are heavily engaged with key customers in each of these areas. Some of which could begin production as early as 2013. 
In etch, our ability to tightly control critical dimensions positions us well for these applications. While in single-wafer clean, we continue to leverage our technology differentiation while driving activities to enhance our product capabilities to address a broader range of front end of line applications. 
All said, our strategy has been and remains focused on developing products and services that strengthen our competitive offerings in established markets and on expanding our business through adjacent market growth both organically, through increased collaboration and through acquisitive measures where appropriate. 
While we are limited by what we can share with you today, our recently announced transaction with Novellus is a clear example of executing that strategy. Their position as a market leader in FINSA deposition and wafer surface preparation technologies complements Lam's core competencies and market leadership. It directly supports our stated adjacent gross market growth strategy. With Novellus, we are not only adding critical process steps that are directly adjacent to our etch and clean solutions, we are also creating a combined company that is well situated to accelerate and optimize collected developments of next-generation 300-millimeter and when appropriate 450-millimeter products and services. 
We plan to share further information regarding our integration plans and expectations for the combined company's performance following the release of our proxy statement in the coming weeks. 
I'd like to now take a look at our early views on 2012.
We believe that the macroeconomic environments will be the single largest influence on 2012 WFE spending variability. Consensus anticipate a slowing of GDP growth globally with risk in the Eurozone and Asia particularly China and the potential for slight improvements in the U.S. 
Consumer-electronics demand remains healthy and revenue should grow as a result albeit at a modest pace. We anticipate the PC unit growth will be in the low single-digits as the industry recovers from the impact of hard disk drive shortages. The emergence of the ultra book, a generally accepted highlight from CES recently should lend support electronic demand but we don't expect penetration rates to grow marketably until more competitive price points are reached later in the year. In addition, we expect both tablet and smartphone unit growth of approximately 40% to play a big role sporting customer investment. 
Given this demand profile and following recent capital spending announcements from a few key device manufacturers, we now forecast 2012 WFE spend levels to be in the range of $30 billion flat to slightly down from 2011. This is an improvement in our outlook. 
As generally acknowledged, DRAM customers are focusing on conversion of existing capacity to the  3x node and below to adjust the profitability objectives, although it's important to note the contract pricing has stabilized in recent weeks. Overall, we anticipate a continued environment of limited new capacity apps with a bit growth in the range of 35% to 40% resulting in flat WFE spending year-over-year in this segment. 
For NAND, contents rich products such as smartphones and tablets are showing strong demand driving another year of relatively healthy NAND spend with big growth assumed in the 65% range. A faster ramp for ultra books represents an upside for those figures as is a broader and faster SSD adoption which we're assuming to have an approximately a 10% penetration in the mobile PC market currently. 
In the foundry space, we see continued capacity ads at the leading edge technology nodes driven by wireless customer demand that appears sustainable. As implied by earlier comments, we are cautiously more optimistic in our 2012 outlook than we were 3 months ago. The big uncertainty being the macro environment.
We believe our performance will be consistent with our previously published financial models and commentary by the company today and since SEMICON West 2011. Specifically, we plan to continue making a strategic investments necessary to successfully position the company for sustainable growth but are planning to do so with a costly spend profile of no more than $200 million operating expenses this year based on our current understanding of opportunities and customer demand. 
As Ernie pointed out, our near-term tax rate has increased by approximately 20% being negatively impacted by geographic revenue mix and timing uncertainty relative to the extension of the R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of calendar our 2011. 
From a market share perspective, this is an important year for the company with meaningful selections anticipated by customers around the many significant transitions and technology inflection points. Aside from investing for the long-term growth with a focus on strengthening positions in dielectric etch and front end of line single-wafer clean, we are targeting successful defenses across our product lines and new applications market share penetrations for the 20-nanometer logic, 2x DRAM and 2y 1X NAND load. Considering the timing of implementing key customer selections in 2012, and the customer spending profile and 2012 similar to 2011, from a shipments market share perspective we would expect modest progress to our previously stated 3 to 5-year growth objectives. 
In summary, 2012 is a critical year for Lam to continue executing against the company's long-term adjacent market growth strategy. In addition to closing the Novellus transaction and executing on our integration plans to deliver targeted results, I previously outlined a number of important milestones in our strategic customer programs that we will be focused on as they develop the architectures, processes and devices necessary to meet the cost performance demand. We believe that we are well positioned for these opportunities building a stronger model of collaboration with customers and that will be a large area of focus for us this year.
Turning now to our outlook for the March 2012 quarter, our guidance is: shipments of $700 million plus or minus $25 million, revenues of $640 million plus or minus $20 million, gross margin at 41% plus or minus 1%. Operating profit at 10.5% plus or minus 1% and earnings per share of $0.44 plus or minus $0.05. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think 1 of the things that's really important to make a statement on my sense is this a generally accepted and understood factor. The level of concentration in spending particularly in the March quarter is very high in 1 or 2 significant customers. And that concentration is a very big part of why the gross margin guidance is what is. I do expect if the mix of customers is more balanced than through the rest of the year and that's currently what we're modeling, that the gross margin percentage that shows up in the March guidance would trend upwards, independent of their being more absolute dollars of revenue. But a big part of the guidance we gave on profitability specifically at the margin level is associated with concentration on 1 or 2 key customers."

But the critical message for us in single-wafer clean is we had good success -- actually very good success without exception defending the positions that we were focused on. And to a very large extent the penetrations you're pursuing we were successful in. The big opportunity prospectively that is something we're very focused on is strengthening the competitive offering of the company to address the front end of line opportunities and that's something that is embedded in the spending communication that we have made for the last several quarters. It's a big focus for the company and that will be pretty influential in terms of the market share story going forward. And my opinion is that I think we're very focused on investments and building that capability and we'll see a fairly kind of mutual 12 months in terms of impact on shipments market share in clean business and then if we've done the right thing at the right time with customers, we'll be making progress in the following years."

One of them is that to the extent profitability in the semiconductor industry requires it. It's a positive for the equipment industry because it serves no purpose to have semiconductor companies in a state of kind of profitless prosperity, so to speak. And so there's a positive associated with consolidation from that regard. On the other side of that coin scale in any relationship with your supplier and the customer is always a challenging reality. I would say relative to the specific chatter that you're describing, my opinion is that it is positive for the industry because maybe a bit it creates a competitive dynamic in the semi space that allows the next leg of investment more proactively."

So relative to the Novellus acquisition, I think in the last call we were communicating that obviously that was the beginning of a process to dial-up customers in any substance any spend a lot of time at customers since that time and I would say the feedback is very positive. We're getting a very good participation by key customers. We're encouraging them actively to communicate their expectations of the combined company. We're encouraging them to participate in sharing their thoughts and ideas in terms of organization and/or collaboration models. We're encouraging them to articulate their view of strengths and weaknesses of both companies. And I'm very optimistic for this result of that we will continue to build upon the customer trust momentum that we've established as independent companies over many years. So the basic headline in terms of customer reaction to being asked acquisition is positive. To the second part of your question which is more directed to the model of collaboration, the most fundamental example of that really speaks to the level of engagement that we have as an equipment company with our customers in their R&D environment. And in the last year particularly, our engagements, our collaboration with key customer R&D environments 2 generations and beyond today's production load is dramatically increased and that's necessary for a couple of reasons. Their are challenges and issues are increasing and the need for our collaboration model is in their interest as much as it is in ours and it's part of obviously the strategy we have to continue growing the company and the leases importantly to create the type of dynamics around protecting what we gained going forward."

DRAM Is not quite exclusively but almost about upgrade and not capacity addition. Certainly, the visibility we have today would suggest that actually the flash environment is kind of fairly first half concentrate actually reasonably balanced and that's true also in DRAM. I think the upside for the second half of the year is all about consumer confidence. It's all about SSD roadmap is all about what happens in ultra books. And if the hard disk drive kind of shortages get resolve sooner then there's potential to see some PC growth above and beyond the assumptions that everybody is meeting today. And I think in the context of how much that Dell made where they I think it's rest the fact that only about 40% or so of corporate upgrades, the kind of Windows 7 were accomplished to date, they would appear to be a fairly positive opportunity should that issue get illuminated. So at least for now we're assuming reasonably equivalent first half second half for both segments. I think the second half for DRAM is probably a little stronger than first."

And in fact, 1 of the reasons we don't give guidance on orders today is because we want to take up the table that dynamic because it serves a shareholder and the customer and the company kind of no value, so our objective is to take orders off the market as soon as they are there. The dynamic that I intend to communicate is that when a big customer participates very significantly in proportion of the business of the company as is particularly true in the March quarter this year, this level of concentration is the highest in the last 4 quarters and we don't see such equivalent concentration in the 4 quarters of calendar '12 today. The specific yields that surround that volume and those configurations in this case happened to drive profitability level in the way it does. I think your question relative to efficiency -- capital efficiency is a legitimate one. I don't think there's any particularly new method in calendar '12 over '11 and we are assuming right now that semi revenue is the kind of 310 to 315 range. And we're assuming as I said already the spending level in terms of wafer fab flat to slightly down. I think the 1 really big headline that we've communicative for some time and I think it's feature significant going forward is the cost associated with scale and particularly in the foundry space and some part of that is associated with scaling and some part of that is associated with the various patterning schemes but obviously are a component of answering 1 of the earlier questions today around the balance of spending etch in wafer fab."

30655,145849549,210900,"Lam Research Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Shayne, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance ranges for the December quarter on all financial metrics. In calendar year 2011, Lam deliver",886,"Thanks, Shayne, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance ranges for the December quarter on all financial metrics. 
In calendar year 2011, Lam delivered $2.8 billion of revenue, generated $696 million in cash from operations, representing 25% of revenues and returned approximately $233 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases.
Moving now to the specifics for the quarter ended December 25, shipments were $563 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range and down 3% from the September quarter. Application and market segment breakdown for the quarter were as follows: Applications at 45-nanometer and below represented 90% of overall system shipments, and we further estimate that about 87% of our quarterly shipments were targeted for applications below the 4x technology node. 
System shipments for the memory segment were 42% of the overall total and included NAND at 28% and DRAM at 14% of total system shipments. Foundry shipments were 46% of total system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance at 12%. 
I'd like to note the beginning in the December quarter, we made a change for our market segment reporting methodology for shipments. Previously our foundry numbers included only pure-play foundries. Starting with this quarter and going forward, we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic and other category.
December quarter revenues were approximately $584 million, representing a sequential decrease of 14% and coming in better than the midpoint of our expected range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.1%,  down from 41.7% in the September quarter and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. 
In addition to product mix, our gross margin performance for the quarter was primarily affected by reduced factory and field utilization rates correlated to the lower revenue levels. 
December quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $180 million, down about $2 million sequentially. Versus the September quarter, we had lower levels of variable compensation reflecting lower overall business levels. 
As we highlighted last quarter, our exiting December month run was on an upper trajectory, which we expect to continue in a manner consistent with prior commentary relative to the need for increased levels of headquarters and customer-facing research and development. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $54 million versus $101 million in the September quarter, and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2% above the high-end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter was 21.8%, higher than we had anticipated due to geographic income mix. As we previously outlined, our tax rate is highly dependent on our U.S. versus non-U.S. income mix. 
For fiscal tax share planning purposes, we make certain assumptions on geographic income mix and overall profitability levels, and actual results may vary from those assumptions. Going forward, we would expect an overall fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP tax rate in the high-teens to low-20% range. This fiscal year rate includes only a 2-quarter benefit from the R&D tax credit which expired December 2011. 
Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, December quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.34 at the high-end of our guidance range for the quarter. The higher tax rate negatively affected our EPS by about $0.02 in the quarter as did the fact that we suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the contemplation of the Novellus transaction. Moving to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments totaled $2.4 billion versus $2.2 billion last quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $169 million in cash from operations, up $82 million sequentially. DSO for the quarter were 72 days, up from 70 days in the September quarter, primarily reflecting collection timing differences due to the year-end cutoff. 
Inventory turns were 3.7, down from the September quarter-end performance of 4.0, largely due to declines in September quarter output levels. We exited the December quarter with deferred revenues of $192 million, up from $181 million in the September quarter and as usual, this excludes shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in the future quarters. In December, the revenue value for these shipments totaled approximately $16 million. 
Non-cash expenses include, among other items, $18 million for equity compensation and $22 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $27 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,850 regular full-time employees. 
As a reminder, in December, we announced our new share repurchase authorization of $1.6 billion, which replaced our prior authorization and which is expected to be completed within one year of the closing of our merger with Novellus. 
During the December quarter, due to deal-related restrictions, our trading activity was very limited. We repurchased approximately $10.6 million of our common stock at an average price of $39 per share, and in addition, we settled a $100 million structured repurchase program and received 2.6 million shares. This structured repurchase program was previously discussed on our September quarter conference call. 
Due to the Novellus transaction, we will have only a short open trading window within the March quarter and we intend to execute repurchases during that open window. 
I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."
30655,145849549,210900,"Lam Research Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ernie. Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transition of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the Nove",1637,"Thank you, Ernie. Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transition of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the Novellus acquisition announcement, it is a pleasure to reengage with the investment community and together with the rest of the Lam team, I look forward to working with you prospectively. 
The wafer fab equipment industry has never been known for its predictability, and 2011 was no exception. The macroeconomic environments remain volatile, highlighted by the European debt crisis, slowing growth in Asia and of course, sluggish performance here in the U.S. In addition, catastrophes in Japan and Thailand created significant disruptions in the consumer electronics and PC supply chains. Combined, this environment caused our customers to be incrementally more cautious despite relatively robust demand for smartphones, tablets and other devices in the year. 
For the equipment market, spending for the second half of 2011 was lower than the first half by double-digit percentage, and was focused almost entirely on leading edge migrations, which include 32-, 28-nanometer expansion for the foundries, 3x and 2x conversation for DRAM and 2x  and 2y node capacity additions for NAND. We believe that wafer fabrication equipment spending for the year was a healthy $31 billion to $32 billion, up about 9% from 2010. 
As previously communicated for Lam specifically, the combination of customer mix and spending patterns resulted in Lam's served markets declining on a year-over-year basis. Notably microprocessor investments represented nearly 20% of overall spend in 2011 compared with approximately 11% in 2010. Additionally, the profile of equipment purchases for leading edge foundry and logic capacity resulted in expending towards the low-end of its historical range at roughly 12% to 12.5% of overall wafer fabrication spending, compared with a high 13% range in 2010. 
With this context, we believe our shipped market share performance for 2011 to be in the upper 40s percentage range for etch and the lower 20s percentage range for single-wafer clean, the headline being a relatively neutral year for the company on this metric. 
On application share basis, which is indicative of forward-looking market share momentum, we anticipate positive gains in etch through N plus 1 with 13 new application wins in 2011 primarily in critical front-end-of-line memory and foundry, more successes than not defending positions and the benefit of a transition to conductor etch associated with various patterning and metal hard mask processing schemes. This performance extends to 11 years, our track record as the global market share leader in etch. 
In single-wafer clean, we believe we gained 10 new applications and successfully defended our existing positions. Both the new and defended applications are in areas where we currently hold strong positions and have demonstrated differentiated results. These include back-end-of-line applications and those targeted for the backside of the wafer. 
We also continue to gain traction in the area of high  aspect ratio cleans, where our drying technology has a demonstrated advantage. 
As we talked about in recent quarters, this is a time of significant critical technology and productivity challenges for our customers, and Lam remains strongly committed to making the necessary R&D investments to address those needs. We believe that this commitment will be recognized with the opportunity to gain share on an ongoing basis and continue to target a 3- to 5-percentage share gain in etch and 5- to 10-percentage share again in single-wafer clean over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Specific 2012 focus areas for the company include the expansion of double patterning steps of the 14-nanometer logic node, quadruple patterning for 2y DRAM devices, 14-nanometer FinFET architectures and 3D NAND structures. We are heavily engaged with key customers in each of these areas, some of which could begin production as early as 2013. 
In etch, our ability to tightly control critical dimensions positions us well for these applications. While in single-wafer clean, we continue to leverage our technology differentiation while driving activities to enhance our product capabilities to address a broader range of front-end-of-line applications. 
All said, our strategy has been and remains focused on developing products and services that strengthen our competitive offerings in established markets and on expanding our business through adjacent market growth both organically, through increased collaboration and through acquisitive measures where appropriate. 
While we are limited by what we can share with you today, our recently announced transaction with Novellus is a clear example of executing that strategy. Their position as a market leader in thin-film deposition and wafer surface preparation technologies complements Lam's core competencies and market leadership. It directly supports our stated adjacent growth market growth strategy. 
With Novellus, we are not only adding critical process steps that are directly adjacent to our etch and clean solutions, we are also creating a combined company that is well-situated to accelerate and optimize collective developments of next-generation 300-millimeter and when appropriate, 450-millimeter products and services. 
We plan to share further information regarding our integration plans and expectations for the combined company's performance following the release of our proxy statement in the coming weeks. 
I'd like to now take a look at our early views on 2012.
We believe that the macroeconomic environments will be the single largest influence on 2012 WFE spending variability. Consensus anticipate a slowing of GDP growth globally with risk in the Eurozone and Asia particularly, China and the potential for slight improvements in the U.S. 
Consumer electronics' demand remains healthy and semi revenue should grow as a result, albeit at a modest pace. We anticipate the PC unit growth will be in the low single-digits as the industry recovers from the impact of hard disk drive shortages. 
The emergence of the ultrabook, a generally accepted highlight from CES recently, should lend support to electronics' demand, but we don't expect penetration rates to grow marketably until more competitive price points are reached later in the year. In addition, we expect both tablet and smartphone unit growth of approximately 40% to play a big role sporting customer investments. 
Given this demand profile and following recent capital spending announcements from a few key device manufacturers, we now forecast 2012 WFE spend levels to be in the range of $30 billion, flat to slightly down from 2011. This is an improvement in our outlook. 
As generally acknowledged, DRAM customers are focusing on conversion of existing capacity to the 3x node and below to address their profitability objectives, although it's important to note the contract pricing has stabilized in recent weeks. Overall, we anticipate a continued environment of limited new capacity apps with bit growth in the range of 35% to 40% resulting in flat WFE spending year-over-year in this segment. 
For NAND, contents-rich products such as smartphones and tablets are showing strong demand driving another year of relatively healthy NAND spend with big growth assumed in the 65% range. A faster ramp for ultrabooks represents an upside for those figures as does a broader and faster SSD adoption, which we're assuming to have approximately a 10% penetration in the mobile PC market currently. 
In the foundry space, we see continued capacity ads at the leading-edge technology nodes, driven by wireless customer demand that appears sustainable. As implied by earlier comments, we are cautiously more optimistic in our 2012 outlook than we were 3 months ago, the big uncertainty being the macro environment.
We believe our performance will be consistent with our previously published financial models and commentary by the company today and since SEMICON West 2011. Specifically, we plan to continue making the strategic investments necessary to successfully position the company for sustainable growth, but are planning to do so with a quarterly spend profile of no more than $200 million operating expenses this year based on our current understanding of opportunities and customer demand. 
As Ernie pointed out, our near-term tax rate has increased by approximately 20% being negatively impacted by geographic revenue mix and timing uncertainty relative to the extension of the R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of calendar our 2011. 
From a market share perspective, this is an important year for the company with meaningful selections anticipated by customers around the many significant transitions and technology inflection points. 
Aside from investing for the long-term growth with a focus on strengthening positions in dielectric etch and front-end-of-line single-wafer clean, we are targeting successful defenses across our product lines and new applications market share penetrations for the 20-nanometer logic, 2x DRAM and 2y 1x NAND nodes. Considering the timing of implementing key customer selections in 2012 and the customer spending profile and 2012 similar to 2011, from a shipments market share perspective, we would expect modest progress to our previously stated 3- to 5-year growth objectives.
In summary, 2012 is a critical year for Lam to continue executing against the company's long-term adjacent market growth strategy. In addition to closing the Novellus transaction and executing on our integration plans to deliver targeted results, I previously outlined a number of important milestones in our strategic customer programs that we will be focused on as they develop the architectures, processes and devices necessary to meet the cost performance demand. We believe that we are well positioned for these opportunities building a stronger model of collaboration with customers, and that will be a large area of focus for us this year.
Turning now to our outlook for the March 2012 quarter, our guidance is: Shipments of $700 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $640 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41%,  plus or minus 1%;  Operating profit at 10.5%, plus or minus 1% and earnings per share of $0.44, plus or minus $0.05. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

And that concentration is a very big part of why the gross margin guidance is what it is. I do expect if the mix of customers is more balanced than through the rest of the year, and that's currently what we are modeling that the gross margin percentage that shows up in the March guidance would trend upwards, independent of their being more absolute dollars of revenue. But a big part of the guidance we gave on profitability specifically at the margin level is associated with concentration on 1 or 2 key customers. I didn't get the second part of your second, Satya."

We're encouraging them to articulate their view of strengths and weaknesses of both companies.

So the basic headline in terms of customer reaction to the announced acquisition is positive. To the second part of your question, which is more directed to the model of collaboration, the most fundamental example of that really speaks to the level of engagement that we have, as an equipment company, with our customers in their R&D environment. And in the last year particularly, our engagements, our collaboration with key customer R&D environments, 2 generations and beyond today's production node is dramatically increased, and that's necessary for a couple of reasons. Their challenges and issues are increasing and the need for a collaboration model is in their interest as much as it is ours.

I think the upside for the second half of the year is all about consumer confidence. It's all about SSD roadmap. It's all about what happens in ultrabooks. And if the hard disk drive kind of shortages get resolved sooner, then there's potential to see some PC growth above and beyond the assumptions that everybody is meeting today. And I think in the context of comments that Dell made, where they, I think, expressed the fact that only about 40% or so of corporate upgrades, the kind of Windows 7, were accomplished to date, they would appear to be a fairly positive opportunity should that issue get illuminated.

So, to the first part of your question, I didn't actually say we gave pricing for an order. And in fact, one of the reasons we don't give guidance on orders today is because we want to take up the table that dynamic because it serves the shareholder and the customer and the company kind of no value. So our objective is to take orders off the market as soon as they are there. The dynamic that I attempt communicate is that when a big customer participates very significantly in a proportion of the business of the company as is particularly true in the March quarter this year. This level of concentration is the highest in the last 4 quarters, and we don't see such equivalent concentration in the 4 quarters of calendar '12 today. The specific yields that surround that volume and those configurations in this case happened to drive profitability level in the way it does. I think your question relative to efficiency -- capital efficiency is a legitimate one. I don't think there's any particularly new message in calendar '12 over '11 and we are assuming right now that semi revenue is the kind of $310 million to $315 million range. And we're assuming as I said already, the spending level in terms of wafer fab, flat to slightly down. I think the one really big headline that we've communicated some time and I think it's feature significantly doing forward is the cost associated with scale and particularly, in the foundry space and some part of that is to associate it with scaling in and of itself. Some part of that is associated with the various patterning schemes, but obviously are a component of answering one of the earlier questions today around the balance outstanding etch in wafer fab."

And one of the dynamics that existed in calendar '11 continues actually in an increased state in 2012.

30655,145849549,210931,"Lam Research Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Shayne, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance ranges for the December quarter on all financial metrics. In calendar year 2011, Lam deliver",886,"Thanks, Shayne, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We ended the calendar year with a solid performance leading or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance ranges for the December quarter on all financial metrics. 
In calendar year 2011, Lam delivered $2.8 billion of revenue, generated $696 million in cash from operations, representing 25% of revenues and returned approximately $233 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases.
Moving now to the specifics for the quarter ended December 25, shipments were $563 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range and down 3% from the September quarter. Application and market segment breakdown for the quarter were as follows: Applications at 45-nanometer and below represented 90% of overall system shipments, and we further estimate that about 87% of our quarterly shipments were targeted for applications below the 4x technology node. 
System shipments for the memory segment were 42% of the overall total and included NAND at 28% and DRAM at 14% of total system shipments. Foundry shipments were 46% of total system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance at 12%. 
I'd like to note, the beginning in the December quarter we made a change for our market segment reporting methodology for shipments. Previously our foundry numbers included only pure-play foundries. Starting with this quarter and going forward, we have modified the foundry category to include manufacturers that have a majority of their logic capacity available for the foundry business. These shipments were previously reported in the logic and other category.
December quarter revenues were approximately $584 million, representing a sequential decrease of 14% and coming in better than the midpoint of our expected range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.1%,  down from 41.7% in the September quarter and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. 
In addition to product mix, our gross margin performance for the quarter was primarily affected by reduced factory and field utilization rates correlated to the lower revenue levels. 
December quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $180 million, down about $2 million sequentially. Versus the September quarter, we had lower levels of variable compensation reflecting lower overall business levels. 
As we highlighted last quarter, our exiting December month run was on an upper trajectory, which we expect to continue in a manner consistent with prior commentary relative to the need for increased levels of headquarters and customer-facing research and development. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $54 million versus $101 million in the September quarter, and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2% above the high-end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter was 21.8%, higher than we had anticipated due to geographic income mix. As we previously outlined, our tax rate is highly dependent on our U.S. versus non-U.S. income mix. 
For fiscal tax share planning purposes, we make certain assumptions on geographic income mix and overall profitability levels, and actual results may vary from those assumptions. Going forward, we would expect an overall fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP tax rate in the high-teens to low-20% range. This fiscal year rate includes only a 2-quarter benefit from the R&D tax credit which expired December 2011. 
Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, December quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.34 at the high-end of our guidance range for the quarter. The higher tax rate negatively affected our EPS by about $0.02 in the quarter as did the fact that we suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the contemplation of the Novellus transaction. Moving to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments totaled $2.4 billion versus $2.2 billion last quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $169 million in cash from operations, up $82 million sequentially. DSO for the quarter were 72 days, up from 70 days in the September quarter, primarily reflecting collection timing differences due to the year-end cutoff. 
Inventory turns were 3.7, down from the September quarter-end performance of 4.0, largely due to declines in September quarter output levels. We exited the December quarter with deferred revenues of $192 million, up from $181 million in the September quarter and as usual, this excludes shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in the future quarters. In December, the revenue value for these shipments totaled approximately $16 million. 
Non-cash expenses include, among other items, $18 million for equity compensation and $22 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $27 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,850 regular full-time employees. 
As a reminder, in December, we announced our new share repurchase authorization of $1.6 billion, which replaced our prior authorization and which is expected to be completed within one year of the closing of our merger with Novellus. 
During the December quarter, due to deal-related restrictions, our trading activity was very limited. We repurchased approximately $10.6 million of our common stock at an average price of $39 per share, and in addition, we settled a $100 million structured repurchase program and received 2.6 million shares. This structured repurchase program was previously discussed on our September quarter conference call. 
Due to the Novellus transaction, we will have only a short open trading window within the March quarter and we intend to execute repurchases during that open window. 
I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."

Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transition of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the Nove",1640,"Thank you, Ernie. Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge that this is my first earnings call following the transition of CEO duties at the end of 2011. Although I've spoken with many of you in the past and most recently subsequent to the Novellus acquisition announcement, it is a pleasure to reengage with the investment community and together with the rest of the Lam team, I look forward to working with you prospectively. 
The wafer fab equipment industry has never been known for its predictability, and 2011 was no exception. The macroeconomic environments remain volatile, highlighted by the European debt crisis, slowing growth in Asia and of course, sluggish performance here in the U.S. In addition, catastrophes in Japan and Thailand created significant disruptions in the consumer electronics and PC supply chains. Combined, this environment caused our customers to be incrementally more cautious despite relatively robust demand for smartphones, tablets and other devices in the year. 
For the equipment market, spending for the second half of 2011 was lower than the first half by a double-digit percentage, and was focused almost entirely on leading edge migrations, which include 32-, 28-nanometer expansion for the foundries, 3x and 2x conversation for DRAM and 2x  and 2y node capacity additions for NAND. We believe that wafer fabrication equipment spending for the year was a healthy $31 billion to $32 billion, up about 9% from 2010. 
As previously communicated for Lam specifically, the combination of customer mix and spending patterns resulted in Lam's served markets declining on a year-over-year basis. Notably microprocessor investments represented nearly 20% of overall spend in 2011 compared with approximately 11% in 2010. Additionally, the profile of equipment purchases for leading edge foundry and logic capacity resulted in expending towards the low-end of its historical range at roughly 12% to 12.5% of the overall wafer fabrication spending, compared with a high 13% range in 2010. 
With this context, we believe our shipped market share performance for 2011 to be in the upper 40s percentage range for etch and the lower 20s percentage range for single-wafer clean, the headline being a relatively neutral year for the company on this metric. 
On application share basis, which is indicative of forward-looking market share momentum, we anticipate positive gains in etch through N plus 1 with 13 new application wins in 2011 primarily in critical front-end-of-line memory and foundry, more successes than not defending positions and the benefit of a transition to conductor etch associated with various patterning and metal hard mask processing schemes. This performance extends to 11 years, our track record as the global market share leader in etch. 
In single-wafer clean, we believe we gained 10 new applications and successfully defended our existing positions. Both the new and defended applications are in areas where we currently hold strong positions and have demonstrated differentiated results. These include back-end-of-line applications and those targeted for the backside of the wafer. 
We also continue to gain traction in the area of high  aspect ratio cleans, where our drying technology has a demonstrated advantage. 
As we talked about in recent quarters, this is a time of significant critical technology and productivity challenges for our customers, and Lam remains strongly committed to making the necessary R&D investments to address those needs. We believe that this commitment will be recognized with the opportunity to gain share on an ongoing basis and continue to target a 3- to 5-percentage share gain in etch and 5- to 10-percentage share again in single-wafer clean over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Specific 2012 focus areas for the company include the expansion of double patterning steps of the 14-nanometer logic node, quadruple patterning for 2y DRAM devices, 14-nanometer FinFET architectures and 3D NAND structures. We are heavily engaged with key customers in each of these areas, some of which could begin production as early as 2013. 
In etch, our ability to tightly control critical dimensions positions us well for these applications. While in single-wafer clean, we continue to leverage our technology differentiation while driving activities to enhance our product capabilities to address a broader range of front-end-of-line applications. 
All said, our strategy has been and remains focused on developing products and services that strengthen our competitive offerings in established markets and on expanding our business through adjacent market growth both organically, through increased collaboration and through acquisitive measures where appropriate. 
While we are limited by what we can share with you today, our recently announced transaction with Novellus is a clear example of executing that strategy. Their position as a market leader in thin-film deposition and wafer surface preparation technologies complements Lam's core competencies and market leadership. It directly supports our stated adjacent growth market growth strategy. 
With Novellus, we are not only adding critical process steps that are directly adjacent to our etch and clean solutions, we are also creating a combined company that is well-situated to accelerate and optimize collective developments of next-generation 300-millimeter and when appropriate, 450-millimeter products and services. 
We plan to share further information regarding our integration plans and expectations for the combined company's performance following the release of our proxy statement in the coming weeks. 
I'd like to now take a look at our early views on 2012.
We believe that the macroeconomic environments will be the single largest influence on 2012 WFE spending variability. Consensus anticipates a slowing of GDP growth globally with risk in the Eurozone and Asia particularly, China and the potential for slight improvements in the U.S. 
Consumer electronics' demand remains healthy and semi revenue should grow as a result, albeit at a modest pace. We anticipate the PC unit growth will be in the low single-digits as the industry recovers from the impact of hard disk drive shortages. 
The emergence of the ultrabook, a generally accepted highlight from CES recently, should lend support to electronics' demand, but we don't expect penetration rates to grow marketably until more competitive price points are reached later in the year. In addition, we expect both tablet and smartphone unit growth of approximately 40% to play a big role sporting customer investments. 
Given this demand profile and following recent capital spending announcements from a few key device manufacturers, we now forecast 2012 WFE spend levels to be in the range of $30 billion, flat to slightly down from 2011. This is an improvement in our outlook. 
As generally acknowledged, DRAM customers are focusing on conversion of existing capacity to the 3x node and below to address their profitability objectives, although it's important to note the contract pricing has stabilized in recent weeks. Overall, we anticipate a continued environment of limited new capacity adds with bit growth in the range of 35% to 40% resulting in flat WFE spending year-over-year in this segment. 
For NAND, contents-rich products such as smartphones and tablets are showing strong demand driving another year of relatively healthy NAND spend with bid growth assumed in the 65% range. A faster ramp for ultrabooks represents an upside for those figures as does a broader and faster SSD adoption, which we're assuming to have approximately a 10% penetration in the mobile PC market currently. 
In the foundry space, we see continued capacity adds at the leading-edge technology nodes, driven by wireless customer demand that appears sustainable. As implied by earlier comments, we are cautiously more optimistic in our 2012 outlook than we were 3 months ago, the big uncertainty being the macro environment.
We believe our performance will be consistent with our previously published financial models and commentary by the company today and since SEMICON West 2011. Specifically, we plan to continue making the strategic investments necessary to successfully position the company for sustainable growth, but are planning to do so with a quarterly spend profile of no more than $200 million operating expenses this year based on our current understanding of opportunities and customer demand. 
As Ernie pointed out, our near-term tax rate has increased by approximately 20% being negatively impacted by geographic revenue mix and timing uncertainty relative to the extension of the R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of calendar our 2011. 
From a market share perspective, this is an important year for the company with meaningful selections anticipated by customers around the many significant transitions and technology inflection points. 
Aside from investing for the long-term growth with a focus on strengthening positions in dielectric etch and front-end-of-line single-wafer clean, we are targeting successful defenses across our product lines and new applications market share penetrations for the 20-nanometer logic, 2x DRAM and 2y 1x NAND nodes. Considering the timing of implementing key customer selections in 2012 and the customer spending profile and 2012 similar to 2011, from a shipments market share perspective, we would expect modest progress to our previously stated 3- to 5-year growth objectives.
In summary, 2012 is a critical year for Lam to continue executing against the company's long-term adjacent market growth strategy. In addition to closing the Novellus transaction and executing on our integration plans to deliver targeted results, I previously outlined a number of important milestones in our strategic customer programs that we will be focused on as they develop the architectures, processes and devices necessary to meet the cost and performance demands. We believe that we are well positioned for these opportunities building a stronger model of collaboration with customers, and that will be a large area of focus for us this year.
Turning now to our outlook for the March 2012 quarter, our guidance is: Shipments of $700 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $640 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41%,  plus or minus 1%;  Operating profit at 10.5%, plus or minus 1% and earnings per share of $0.44, plus or minus $0.05. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

Yes, I think one of the things that's really important to make a statement on and my sense is this a generally accepted and understood factor is the level of concentration in spending particularly in the March quarter is very high on 1 or 2 significant customers. And that concentration is a very big part of why the gross margin guidance is what it is. I do expect if the mix of customers is more balanced than through the rest of the year, and that's currently what we are modeling that the gross margin percentage that shows up in the March guidance would trend upwards, independent of their being more absolute dollars of revenue. But a big part of the guidance we gave on profitability specifically at the margin level is associated with concentration on 1 or 2 key customers.

And I think there's some critical decisions that will be made in calendar 2012. But to a very large extent, the revenue opportunities will extend into the '13 or '14 kind of calendar year. So this is really a time to position, and we'll see the revenues when the investment profile occurs, obviously."

It's a big focus for the company, and that will be pretty influential in terms of the market share story going forward. My opinion is that I think we're very focused on investments in building that capability and we'll see a fairly kind of mutual 12 months in terms of impact on shipments market share in clean business. And then if we've done the right thing at the right time with customers, we'll be making progress in the following years."

We're encouraging them to participate in sharing their thoughts and ideas in terms of organization and/or collaboration models. We're encouraging them to articulate their view of strengths and weaknesses of both companies. And I'm very optimistic that as a result of that we will continue to build upon the customer trust momentum that we've established as independent companies over many years. So the basic headline in terms of customer reaction to the announced acquisition is positive. To the second part of your question, which is more directed to the model of collaboration, the most fundamental example of that really speaks to the level of engagement that we have, as an equipment company, with our customers in their R&D environment. And in the last year particularly, our engagements, our collaboration with key customer R&D environments, 2 generations and beyond today's production node is dramatically increased, and that's necessary for a couple of reasons. Their challenges and issues are increasing and the need for a collaboration model is in their interest as much as it is ours.

Certainly, the visibility we have today would suggest that actually, the flash environment is kind of fairly first half concentrate, actually reasonably balanced. And that's true also in DRAM. I think the upside for the second half of the year is all about consumer confidence. It's all about SSD roadmap. It's all about what happens in ultrabooks. And if the hard disk drive kind of shortages get resolved sooner, then there's potential to see some PC growth above and beyond the assumptions that everybody is meeting today. And I think in the context of comments that Dell made, where they, I think, expressed the fact that only about 40% or so of corporate upgrades, the kind of Windows 7, were accomplished to date, they would appear to be a fairly positive opportunity should that issue get illuminated.

And in fact, one of the reasons we don't give guidance on orders today is because we want to take off the table that dynamic because it serves the shareholder and the customer and the company kind of no value. So our objective is to take orders off the market as soon as they are there. The dynamic that I attempt to communicate is that when a big customer participates very significantly in a proportion of the business of the company as is particularly true in the March quarter this year. This level of concentration is the highest in the last 4 quarters, and we don't see such equivalent concentration in the 4 quarters of calendar '12 today. The specific yields that surround that volume and those configurations in this case happened to drive profitability level in the way it does. I think your question relative to efficiency -- capital efficiency is a legitimate one. I don't think there's any particularly new message in calendar '12 over '11. And we are assuming right now that semi revenue is the kind of $310 million to $315 million range. And we're assuming as I said already, the spending level in terms of wafer fab, flat to slightly down. I think the one really big headline that we've communicated some time and I think it's feature significantly going forward is the cost associated with scale and particularly, in the foundry space and some part of that is associated with scaling in and of itself. Some part of that is associated with the various patterning schemes, but obviously are a component of answering one of the earlier questions today around the balance outstanding etch in wafer fab."

Thanks for joining the call. Our March quarter represents a solid start to the calendar year as Lam shipments gross margin, operating margin and EPS results met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance rang",759,"Thank you, Cheney, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Our March quarter represents a solid start to the calendar year as Lam shipments gross margin, operating margin and EPS results met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Relative to these specifics, shipments for the quarter were approximately $713 million, up 27% from the December quarter and indicative of improving customer demand across all product lines, and most notably, in the foundry space.
The breakdown by application and market segment was as follows: Applications for the 4x technology node and below represented 91% of overall shipment and the memory segment accounted for 40% of all systems shipments with NAND at 30% and DRAM at 10%. Foundry accounted for 53% of overall system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance of 7%.
March quarter revenues came in at the high end of our guidance range at $659 million, up 13% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was at 40.9%, up sequentially from 40.1% and is consistent with our expectations of customer concentration and mix, offsetting improvements in factory utilization from the increased business levels.
As planned, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased to approximately $197 million versus $180 million in the December quarter. More than 70% of this incremental spend was focused on next-generation R&D and the customer-facing activity that surround and support it.
The balance of the operating expense change was attributable to higher variable compensation expenses associated with higher profit levels, as well as expenses related to market appreciation of deferred compensation plan assets.
Lam intends to mitigate overall exposure relative to market fluctuations impacting these plans and this quarter is no exception. The increased operating expenses related to these plans were simply offset by increased income in other income and expense.
As we indicated on our last call, we remain committed to keeping Lam stand-alone operating expenses at or below $200 million per quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $73 million versus $54 million in the December quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.1%, slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was 20.4% compared to 21.8% in the prior quarter.
On a Lam standalone basis, we estimate the June quarter tax rate to be in the midteens, bringing our fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate to around 20%. This rate would be favorably impacted by approximately 2% should Congress extend the federal R&D tax credit prior to the end of our fiscal year.
Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, March quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50 exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.06. Our EPS results were impacted primarily by the favorable operating results.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $0.38. The GAAP results this quarter include both acquisition and integration costs associated with the Novellus transaction, as well as costs resulting from a customer bankruptcy filing. As has been our practice, the amortization of convertible note discounts are also included. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's press release.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments of $2.6 billion versus $2.4 billion last quarter. During the quarter, we settled a structured share repurchase agreement and received $79 million in cash, and we also delivered cash from operations of $146 million in the March quarter versus $169 million in the December quarter.
DSO for the quarter were 65 days, down from 72 days in the prior quarter and inventory turns of 4.2 represented an improvement from the prior quarter end performance of 3.7 terms.
Our deferred revenue this quarter grew by $54 million to end March at $246 million, excluding approximately $19 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. 
Non-cash expenses include, among other items, $16 million per equity compensation and $23 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $28 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,900 regular full-time employees.
In closing and similar to the December quarter, our ability to buyback shares this quarter was very limited due to restrictions relating to the pending Novellus transaction. We repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for about $12.5 million and look forward to resuming more substances of share repurchases shortly after the May 10 Novellus shareholder vote.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his perspective on the quarter."

As we just articulated, Lam successfully delivered on its financial commitments for the March quarter. We achieved this performance while also executing key milestones towards our most important strategic objective. Specifically, this includes significant momentum on the integration planning with Novellus and progress demonstrating results from continued investments designed to extend our technical differentiation and advanced longer-term growth. The solid performance and execution we believe illustrate a high level of focus throughout the organization, and I would like to recognize and thank employees and the management teams of both companies for this extraordinary achievement and for laying the foundation for what we believe will be a very important year for the combined company. I will share more with you on each of these subjects shortly, but first I would like to refresh our views on the industry environments.
Our view of wafer fabrication equipment spending has not materially changed since our last earnings call. We still expect spending within a range of $30 billion to $32 billion in 2012, and based on the plans our customers are communicating to us today, we would look for spending to be relatively balanced between the first and second half of the calendar year with less customer concentration beyond the June quarter.
Demand for leading edge logic capacity continues to strengthen as IBM's and fabless company's compete to supply power efficiency in the high performance devices for the mobile market.
For the foundries, given the strong demand environments, we now project they will add between 85,000 and 90,000 new wafer starts per month of 32- to 28-nanometer capacity needed this year which would translate into ending 2012, with capacity at this node of 220,000 to 240,000 wafer starts per month.
Using 65-nanometer as a baseline, foundries will have added between 250,000 and 300,000 wafer starts per month of capacity throughout the lifecycle of that node.
Associated with IBM's transitioning more of their leading edge capacity to foundries since the 45-nanometer node and the broader demand profile for consumer devices, we would expect total lifetime capacity added for the 28-nanometer node will exceed this historical range.
Turning to the DRAM segments. Our view of the demand drivers has not changed considerably. We still anticipate new to PC unit growth reflecting the hard disk drive shortages, a cautious corporate refresh cycle and subdued content growth. Consistent with our prior commentary, DRAM, WFE spending will be comprised almost entirely from capacity conversions in 2012. Considering this, we would expect that bit growth for 2012 is in the lower 30% range versus our prior view of the mid-to upper 30% range. Needless to say, should PC volumes expand later in the year, supply shortages will likely lead to DRAM price increases and manufacturers will typically adding new capacity at that time. This could occur towards the end of the year.
For NAND, we continue to forecast bit growth in the range of 65% in 2012, with a higher proportion of capacity conversions versus new capacity additions relative to 2011. As a result, we are still projecting a modest decline in NAND's WFE spend year-over-year, which reflects our customers plans to maintain a healthy balance of supply and demand. 
Combined, this supports a relatively stable total WFE spending outlook. This is a result of several factors, including the broadening of semiconductor demand drivers, consolidation among the customer base, cycle time improvements from the equipment companies, and the prudent management to spending plans by the customer align with the demand outlook. As a result, cycles are potentially shaped less by industry-induced supply and demand imbalances and more by changes in the macroeconomic environment and consumer confidence.
At this point, the current economic outlook for 2013 suggests a more likely slightly positive environment relative to 2012, supporting the potential for stability and growth in our markets.
Given that Lam's market share is relatively balanced across each of the market segments with one exception, our continued execution would have us stand to benefit should the upside scenarios play out.
Collectively, this is positive news. However, while the top-down view of WFE spending is characterized by relative stability there's quite a bit of change going on beneath the surface. For our customers, the mounting cost challenges we described previously are driven in large parts by the levels of device complexity required to deliver lower power, longer battery life and increased functionality demanded by the consumer markets.
For equipment suppliers, these trends present both opportunities and challenges, whereby success is predicated on the ability to partner with customers to quickly sell these increasingly complex technical and productivity challenges. Customers trust and partnership is ever more important.
As we have talked about for most of the past year, now is a critical time for us to leverage our strength in developing solutions that address our customers' most critical technical challenges. We continue to see opportunities in each of our core product areas that should position us to execute against our 3- to 5-year market share objectives of 3 to 5 percentage point gain in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points gains in single-wafer clean. 
In etch, we have held the leading position and the conductor space for more than a decade and believe that we are well positioned for future opportunities with the expansion of patenting techniques and the transition of structures. In each of these areas, the ability to tightly control feature dimensions and depth uniformity across the wafer is crucial for device performance, and we believe Lam is currently the market leader for critical patterning, Gates in isolation applications across both memory and foundry segments. 
In dielectric etch, we are focused on strengthening our product and process capabilities to expand share over the next several years accordingly. Accordingly in memory, we focus on the next generation of high aspect ratio structures. We're leveraging our demonstrated stress the position the company for growth opportunities as NAND's manufacturers plan to transition the 3D structures.
In Foundry/Logic, we are targeting growth in back and the flight and the connect applications by advancing our capabilities to deliver solutions for both performance and productivity.
In single-wafer clean, our ability to tightly control the cleaning process has led to technical differentiation in a few key application areas. As a result, we currently hold leading positions in the areas of wafer backside and level cleaning and the back end of line. We are developing capabilities necessary to expand our share in the front-end-of-line by translating some of our process tuning capabilities in etch and applying them to clean processing. We're also focused on enhancing the productivity of our Kleen systems' to more effectively compete for a broader range of applications and expect to deliver differentiated process results to support accelerated market share momentum moving through the sub20-nanometer node. 
Our product strategy remains focused on delivering best-of-breed technology and productivity solutions to our customers. This objective is core to our market share expansion strategy. As we pursue these opportunities, we have communicated to you our commitments to keeping quarterly operating expenses below $200 million for this calendar year. We are pleased to have delivered that in the March quarter and are reiterating that commitment relative to Lam's standalone business as we move forward.
I'll share with you now our outlook for the June quarter: Shipments of $725 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $710 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41.5%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 13.5%, plus or minus 1%; and earnings per share of $0.67, plus or minus $0.05.
In anticipation of closing the transaction with Novellus, I would like to clearly state the guidance I just provided represents projections for Lam as a stand-alone company. We expect to present our view for the combined company on our July conference call.
Prior to opening this call for Q&A, I will provide a brief update on the status of the Novellus acquisition. As you may have read in our proxy statements, we have scheduled our Special Shareholder Meeting from May 10, and thus far, we have received regulatory approvals from all required countries with the exception of China.
We continue to expect that the acquisition will close within the June quarter. At this point, integration planning is well underway and is progressing as planned. We've established an integration team comprised with executives and senior level employees with both companies and supplement facts where valuable with experienced external resources. We have completed an assessment of each company's culture, organizational structures and business processes in detail and determined there are more similarities than differences. We have made and communicated decisions relative to these subjects through both companies already.
We have defined a set of objectives around prioritized areas of focus to begin immediately on day one following transaction closure, and as we've discussed in the past, answering this transaction is seamless where our customers remains a critical priority.
We have validated our opportunity to achieve our target of $100 million in annualized costs synergies exiting 2013, which we plan to commence at some level immediately on closing and accelerates over the 6 quarter period. Through these activities, it is fair to say we are now more confident in the strategic rationale of this transaction and the value proposition we believe it brings our customers and shareholders.
Given the expected timing for deal closure and our immediate focus on both integration and our customers, we have decided to hold our 2012 Analyst Event in the November timeframe rather than during the SEMICON West conference this year. This move will give us the opportunity to present you a more comprehensive view of the combined company and our future growth plans. We are excited about the opportunities that this transaction presents for the combined company and we look forward to keeping you updated over the second half of the calendar year on our progress.
I would like to express once more my tremendous satisfaction for the company's accomplishments in the March quarter. The period which included a leadership position to start a significant integration planning for the single largest transaction in the company's history and an ever challenging industry environments. Our performance illustrates the strength of both our employee base and leadership team, which are obviously core to our success in the years to come.
With that, Ernie and I will open the call for questions."

And so I don't think there's a fundamental message for us to be communicating today relative to shipments momentum in the guidance we've given for June. I do think that the shipments for Lam certainly as we're modeling that against the wafer fab outlook that we've communicated. We're expecting the shipments for Lam are approximately kind of equal first half and second half. And at a segment level, that would probably translate for us to have foundry logic first half maybe in the mid-50s or 55, 45 split approximately and memory maybe slightly in the opposite directions. So 47, 48 range for first half, 52 to 53 second half. So that's about the best that I can probably give you on the shipments at this time."

Relative to leverage, Jim, and I think there's clearly 2 things going on today. There's the conversation about leverage and then there's the conversation about customer concentration. And we worked really hard to deliver the same variability and cost structure today that we did last year 2 years ago, 5 years ago, 10 years ago. The outsourcing initiative is still alive and well in our company. And to illustrate that point, when I look at the shipments momentum in the company, March over December, we had a pretty sizable increase in the shipments percentage of the company and yet the underlying gross spending and the company associated with factory and field increased only by a single-digit percentage. So there's a very healthy statement of leverage in the kind of transactional base cost structure of the company. What is challenging for us and perhaps even more challenging for us in the midst of our peer equipment companies because of our kind of relative lack of position in a certain segment now is customer concentration. And we certainly were sitting here 3 months ago speaking to you about the fact that customer concentration was extraordinarily high in the March quarter. The outlook that time had us conclude that by the time we go to June that will be much more normalized and we do expect some pickup. And as I think everybody on the call knows that since that time, the public announcements that have been made by customers have actually kind of stretched the concentration into the June quarter. And that's why the messages today of what at this a few pretty good about the margin uptick for the company. I think when you look at kind of the sequential performance, March to June that we guided, the absolute dollars of revenue that pickup is reasonable. But the headline still for the first half is customer concentration is still meaningfully above the average of last year. And when we look at the full year, I don't know that I would conclude that actually the full calendar year gets close to kind of the participation levels broadly that we saw in 2011. Meaning that in spite of the fact that things get better, I don't think they get back to the same level of participation that we saw in 2011. And maybe just to frame that assumption on wafer fab efficient equipment spending, so I kind of talked about in outlook of the year of 30 to 32, we're assuming the top 3 guys are in the $18 billion to $20 billion range combined."

I apologize here. But I was saying when they gave you some numbers on first half, second half memory that we were thinking about the 47, 48 level for memory first half and second half 52, 53 range. And clearly the outlook for the company is based on the complete set of investments DRAM and NAND. When we look at the memory segments, clearly DRAM is all about conversion and upgrades and there's very little incremental capacity this year. I think certainly as we look at plans today, 20,000 wafer starts with addition will probably on the optimistic side in outlooks. So clearly when it comes to capacity adds, we're making an assumption today of about 130,000 wafer starts of additions, decent amount of upgrades. And in terms of upside, I would say there are some obvious moving parts. One of them is Ultrabooks. And there appears to be, as best I can tell, some pretty helpful AFP trajectories that might be timed well to be a catalyst for demand kind of back-to-school season. I think we're sitting in the 800, 900 range and maybe heading down to 800, 700 as a catalyst. So there's plenty of room clearly for ultra books for SSD broadly as a percentage of mobile devices to gain momentum. But the price point is may be still not quite where it needs to be. So we're assuming you have to be in the kind of $100 range to be a catalyst against the hard disk in solid state drives, and we're probably at about 140 to 110 depending on where you take a commercial view of configurations versus the consumer. I think there is some upside in DRAM, but it's kind of too early to tell, frankly. And for me, feels much more about exactly what plays out second half in the hard disk space, how that plays out in the impacts content because it appears like us kind of densities in hard disks have kind of contracted to manage the supply issues that it had a content consequence on DRAM as well. And I think there's perhaps it can only get better, maybe that's my summary there."

The equipment selection decisions are right on us. I mean, they're on that some of them are behind us, and some of them are ahead of us. So there's clearly an expectation that there is some 20-nanometer qualification activities towards the back of the calendar year. And I would expect kind of production to occur in the '13 timeframe.

So we have tough competitive period. The rationale, obviously, for us having a plain clean is all about an adjacent strategy, the marketplaces considerably more fragmented than the edge marketplace, the competitive dynamic is tough, the growth as you quite rightly as pointed out in your question is occurring at the pace that is faster than over all WFE growth. And that reflects to a large extent the transitions that have been occurring now for the last 2 or 3 years, particularly at the front end from batch single-wafer processing. That is a trend that is kind of reaching the end of its most obvious kind of transition. So I think maybe in the '13 or '14 timeline, we'll see a single-wafer clean segment that is much more in tune with the pace of growth as the rest of wafer fab. As I articulated in my prepared comments, I feel like we've got a very competitive product portfolio and we have meaningful strength and presence in the backside level and back end of line, the clean applications. The area of focus for us which unfortunately coincides with significant amounts of this single-wafer transition is we are addressing some gaps in terms of product capability that I think in the 20-nanometer growth nodes spending situations will give us a lot more upside. But front-end-of-line is clearly not the competitive strength for our company today that it needs to be in at this the competitive strength that our backend segment in clean is."

I think I answered very specifically the last time, I think anything above the 40% capacity I think today I'd say anything about 35% drive capacity. One of the interesting dynamics that I think we're all sensitive to is although we're looking at this thing called DRAM, and saying big growth of the 30% to 35% range, if you kind of get underneath that to each of the segments, PCD DRAM growth this year is probably about only 15%. And then you look at service work stations, cell phones and set-top boxes each is one of those has the bigger the expansion of more than 60 and the DRAM bit growth and tablet is about 11% at least in terms of the modeling that we have. And so it's not going to take that much but something kind of needs to give clearly and there's a mix of consumer dynamics with ultra books and a broader kind of notebook this tablets in the broader notebook and a supply uncertainty that makes it difficult to predict what I would certainly say we would expect based on what we know that capacity additions occur on bit growth above or about 35%."

Thanks for joining the call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year as Lam shipments, revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS results met or exceeded the midpoint of our gu",760,"Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year as Lam shipments, revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS results met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Relative to these specifics, shipments for the quarter were approximately $713 million, up 27% from the December quarter and indicative of improving customer demand across all product lines and most notably, in the foundry space.
The breakdown by application and market segment was as follows. Applications for the 4x technology node and below represented 91% of overall system shipments, and the memory segment accounted for 40% of all systems shipments, with NAND at 30% and DRAM at 10%. Foundry accounted for 53% of overall system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance of 7%.
March quarter revenues came in at the high end of our guidance range at $659 million, up 13% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was at 40.9%, up sequentially from 40.1% and is consistent with our expectations of customer concentration and mix, offsetting improvements in factory utilization from the increased business levels.
As planned, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased to approximately $197 million versus $180 million in the December quarter. More than 70% of this incremental spend was focused on next-generation R&D and the customer-facing activity that surround and support it. The balance of the operating expense change was attributable to higher variable compensation expenses associated with higher profit levels, as well as expenses related to market appreciation of deferred compensation plan assets.
Lam intends to mitigate overall exposure relative to market fluctuations impacting these plans, and this quarter is no exception. The increased operating expenses related to these plans were substantively offset by increased income in other income and expense.
As we indicated on our last call, we remain committed to keeping Lam standalone operating expenses at or below $200 million per quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $73 million versus $54 million in the December quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.1%, slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was 20.4% compared to 21.8% in the prior quarter.
On a Lam standalone basis, we estimate the June quarter tax rate to be in the mid-teen, bringing our fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate to around 20%. This rate would be favorably impacted by approximately 2% should congress extend the federal R&D tax credit prior to the end of our fiscal year.
Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, March quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.06. Our EPS results were impacted primarily by the favorable operating results.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $0.38. The GAAP results this quarter include both acquisition and integration costs associated with the Novellus transaction, as well as costs resulting from a customer bankruptcy filing. As has been our practice, the amortization of convertible note discounts are also included. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's press release.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments, of $2.6 billion versus $2.4 billion last quarter. During the quarter, we settled a structured share repurchase agreement and received $79 million in cash, and we also delivered cash from operations of $146 million in the March quarter versus $169 million in the December quarter.
DSO for the quarter were 65 days, down from 72 days in the prior quarter, and inventory turns of 4.2 represented an improvement from the prior quarter end performance of 3.7 turns. Our deferred revenue this quarter grew by $54 million, to end March at $246 million, excluding approximately $19 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. 
Noncash expenses include, among other items, $16 million per equity compensation and $23 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,900 regular full-time employees.
In closing and similar to the December quarter, our ability to buyback shares this quarter was very limited due to restrictions relating to the pending Novellus transaction. We've repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for about $12.5 million and look forward to resuming more substantive share repurchases shortly after the May 10 Novellus shareholder vote.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his perspective on the quarter."

As we just articulated, Lam successfully delivered on its financial commitments for the March quarter. We achieved this performance while also executing key milestones towards our most important strategic objectives. 
Specifically, this includes significant momentum on the integration planning with Novellus and progress demonstrating results from continued investments designed to extend our technical differentiation and advance longer-term growth. 
The solid performance and execution, we believe, illustrate a high level of focus throughout the organization, and I would like to recognize and thank employees and the management teams of both companies for this extraordinary achievement and for laying the foundation for what we believe will be a very important year for the combined company. I will share more with you on each of these subjects shortly, but first, would like to refresh our views on the industry environments.
Our view of wafer fabrication equipment spending has not materially changed since our last earnings call. We still expect spending within a range of $30 billion to $32 billion in 2012, and based on the plans our customers are communicating to us today, we would look for spending to be relatively balanced between the first and second half of the calendar year, with less customer concentration beyond the June quarter.
Demand for leading-edge logic capacity continues to strengthen as IBM and fabless companies compete to supply power efficiency in the high performance devices for the mobile market. For the foundries, given the strong demand environments, we now project they will add between 85,000 and 90,000 new wafer starts per month of 32-, 28-nanometer capacity this year, which would translate into ending 2012 with capacity at this node of 220,000 to 240,000 wafer starts per month. 
Using 65-nanometer as a baseline, foundries will have added between 250,000 and 300,000 wafer starts per month of capacity throughout the life cycle of that node. Associated with IBM's transitioning more of their leading-edge capacity to foundries since the 45-nanometer node and the broader demand profile for consumer devices, we would expect total lifetime capacity added for the 28-nanometer node will exceed the historical range.
Turning to the DRAM segments. Our view of the demand drivers has not changed considerably. We still anticipate muted PC unit growth, reflecting the hard disk drive shortages, a cautious corporate refresh cycle and subdued content growth. Consistent with our prior commentary, DRAM, WFE spending will be comprised almost entirely from capacity conversions in 2012. 
Considering this, we would expect that bit growth for 2012 is in the lower 30% range versus our prior view of the mid to  upper 30% range. Needless to say, should PC volumes expand later in the year, supply shortages will likely lead to DRAM price increases and the manufacturers will typically begin adding new capacity at that time. This could occur towards the end of the year.
For NAND, we continue to forecast bit growth in the range of 65% in 2012, with a higher proportion of capacity conversions versus new capacity additions relative to 2011. As a result, we are still projecting a modest decline in NAND's WFE spend year-over-year, which reflects our customers' plans to maintain a healthy balance of supply and demand. 
Combined, this supports a relatively stable total WFE spending outlook. This is the result of several factors, including the broadening of semiconductor demand drivers, consolidation among the customer base, cycle time improvements from the equipment companies and the prudent management to spending plans by the customer to align with the demand outlook. As a result, cycles are potentially shaped  less by industry-induced supply, demand imbalances and more by changes in the macroeconomic environment and consumer confidence. 
At this point, the current economic outlook for 2013 suggests a more likely slightly positive macro environment relative to 2012, supporting the potential for stability and growth in our markets. Given that Lam's market share is relatively balanced across each of the market segments, with one exception, our continued execution would have us stand to benefit should the upside scenarios play out.
Collectively, this is positive news. However, while the top-down view of WFE spending is characterized by relative stability there's quite a bit of change going on beneath the surface. For our customers, the mounting cost challenges we've described previously are driven in large parts by the levels of device complexity required to deliver lower power, longer battery life and increased functionality demanded by the consumer markets.
For equipment suppliers, these trends present both opportunities and challenges, whereby success is predicated on the ability to partner with customers to quickly sell these increasingly complex technical and productivity challenges. Customer trust and partnership is ever more important.
As we have talked about for most of the past year, now is a critical time for us to leverage our strength in developing solutions that address our customers' most critical technical challenges. We continue to see opportunities in each of our core product areas that should position us to execute against our 3- to 5-year market share objectives of a 3 to 5 percentage point gain in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points gain in single-wafer clean. 
In etch, we have held the leading position in the conductor space for more than a decade and believe that we are well positioned for future opportunities with the expansion of patenting techniques and the transition to FinFET structures. In each of these areas, the ability to tightly control feature dimensions and depth uniformity across the wafer is crucial for device performance, and we believe Lam is currently the market leader for critical patterning, gates and isolation applications across both memory and foundry segments. 
In dielectric etch, we are focused on strengthening our product and process capabilities to expand share over the next several years. Accordingly, in memory, we continue to focus on the next generation of high aspect ratio structures. We're leveraging our demonstrated strengths to position the company for growth opportunities as NAND's manufacturers plan to transition to the 3D structures. In Foundry/Logic, we are targeting growth in back-end-of-line interconnect applications by advancing our capabilities to deliver solutions for both performance and productivity.
In single-wafer clean, our ability to tightly control the cleaning process has led to technical differentiation in a few key application areas. As a result, we currently hold leading positions in the areas of wafer backside and bevel cleaning and the back-end-of-line. 
We are developing capabilities necessary to expand our share in the front-end-of-line by translating some of our process tuning capabilities in etch and applying them to clean processing. We're also focused on enhancing the productivity of our clean systems to more effectively compete for a broader range of applications and expect to deliver differentiated process results to support accelerated market share momentum moving through the sub-20-nanometer node. 
Our product strategy remains focused on delivering best-of-breed technology and productivity solutions to our customers. This objective is core to our market share expansion strategy. As we pursue these opportunities, we have communicated to you our commitments to keeping quarterly operating expenses below $200 million for this calendar year. We are pleased to have delivered that in the March quarter and are reiterating that commitment relative to Lam's standalone business as we move forward.
I'll share with you now our outlook for the June quarter: shipments of $725 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $710 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41.5%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 13.5%, plus or minus 1%; and earnings per share of $0.67, plus or minus $0.05. In anticipation of closing the transaction with Novellus, I would like to clearly state that the guidance I just provided represents projections for Lam as a standalone company. We expect to present our view for the combined company on our July conference call.
Prior to opening this call for Q&A, I will provide a brief update on the status of the Novellus acquisition. As you may have read in our proxy statements, we have scheduled our Special Shareholder Meeting for May 10, and thus far, we have received regulatory approvals from all required countries with the exception of China. We continue to expect that the acquisition will close within the June quarter. 
At this point, integration planning is well underway and is progressing as planned. We've established an integration team comprised with executives and senior level employees from both companies and supplement facts, where valuable, with experienced external resources. We have completed an assessment of each company's culture, organizational structures and business processes in detail and determined there are more similarities than differences. We have made and communicated decisions relative to these subjects through both companies already. We have defined a set of objectives around prioritized areas of focus to begin immediately on day 1 following transaction closure, and as we've discussed in the past, ensuring this transaction is seamless for our customers remains a critical priority. 
We have validated our opportunity to achieve our target of $100 million in annualized costs synergies exiting 2013, which we plan to commence at some level immediately on closing and accelerate over the 6 quarter period. Through these activities, it is fair to say we are now more confident in the strategic rationale of this transaction and the value proposition we believe it brings our customers and shareholders.
Given the expected timing for deal closure and our immediate focus on both integration and our customers, we have decided to hold our 2012 analyst event in the November time frame rather than during the SEMICON West conference this year. This move will give us the opportunity to present you a more comprehensive view of the combined company and our future growth plans. We are excited about the opportunities that this transaction presents for the combined company, and we look forward to keeping you updated over the second half of the calendar year on our progress.
I would like to express once more my tremendous satisfaction for the company's accomplishments in the March quarter, a period which included a leadership transition, the start of significant integration planning for the single largest transaction in the company's history and an ever challenging industry environment. Our performance illustrates the strength of both our employee base and leadership team, which are obviously core to our success in the years to come.
With that, Ernie and I will open the call for questions."

And so I don't think there's a fundamental message for us to be communicating today relative to shipments momentum in the guidance that we've given for June. I do think that the shipments for Lam, certainly, as we're modeling that against the wafer fab outlook that we've communicated, we're expecting the shipments for Lam are approximately kind of equal first half and second half. And at a segment level, that would probably translate for us to have Foundry/Logic first half maybe in the mid-50s, a 55, 45 split approximately and memory maybe slightly in the opposite directions. So 47, 48 range for first half, 52 to 53 second half. So that's about the best that I can probably give you on the shipments at this time."

Relative to leverage, Jim, I think that there's clearly 2 things going on today. There's the conversation about leverage, and then, there's the conversation about customer concentration. And we worked really hard to deliver the same variability and cost structure today that we did last year, 2 years ago, 5 years ago, 10 years ago. The outsourcing initiative is still alive and well in our company. And to illustrate that point, when I look at the shipments momentum in the company, March over December, we had a pretty sizable increase in the shipments percentage of the company, and yet the underlying gross spending and the company associated with factory and field increased only by a single-digit percentage. So there's a very healthy statement of leverage in the kind of transactional base cost structure of the company. What is challenging for us and perhaps even more challenging for us in the midst of our peer equipment companies because of our kind of relative lack of position in certain segments is customer concentration. And we certainly were sitting here 3 months ago speaking to you about the fact that customer concentration was extraordinarily high in the March quarter. The outlook at that time had us conclude that by the time we got to June that would be kind of much more normalized, then we'd expect some pickup. And as I think everybody on the call knows that since that time, the public announcements that have been made by customers have actually kind of stretched the concentration into the June quarter. And that's why the message is, today what it is, I feel pretty good about the margin uptick for the company. I think when you look at kind of the sequential performance, March to June, that we've guided, the absolute dollars of revenue, that pickup is reasonable. But the headline still for the first half is customer concentration is still meaningfully above the average of last year. And when we look at the full year, I don't know that I would conclude that actually the full calendar year gets close to kind of the participation levels, broadly, that we saw in 2011. Meaning, that in spite of the fact that things get better, I don't think they get back to the same level of participation that we saw in 2011. And maybe just to frame that, our assumption on wafer fabrication equipment spending, so I kind of talked about an outlook of the year of 30 to 32. We're assuming the top 3 guys are in the $18 billion to $20 billion range combined."

But I was saying when I gave you some numbers on first half, second half memory that we were thinking about the 47, 48 level for memory first half and second half, 52, 53 range. And clearly, the outlook for the company is based on the complete sets  of investments, DRAM and NAND. When we look at the memory segments, clearly DRAM is all about conversion and upgrades, and there's very little incremental capacity this year. I think, certainly, as we look at plants today, 20,000 wafer starts of addition in DRAM would probably on the optimistic side in outlook. So clearly when it comes to capacity adds, we're making an assumption today of about 130,000 wafer starts of additions, decent amount of upgrades. And in terms of upside, I would say there are some obvious moving parts. One of them is ultrabooks. And there appears to be, as best as I can tell, some pretty helpful AFP trajectories that might be timed well to be a catalyst for ultrabook demand around kind of back-to-school season. So I think we're sitting on the 800, 900 range and may be heading down to 800, 700 as a healthy catalyst. So there's plenty of room, clearly, for ultra books for SSD broadly as a percentage of mobile devices to gain momentum. But the price point is maybe still not quite where it needs to be. So we're assuming you have to be in the kind of $100 range to be a catalyst against the hard disk in solid state drives, and we're probably at about 140 to 110 depending on whether you take a commercial view of configurations versus the consumer. I think there is some upside in DRAM, but it's kind of too early to tell, frankly. And for me, feels much more about exactly what plays out second half in the hard disk space, how that plays out and impacts content because it appears like as kind of densities in hard disks have kind of contracted to manage the supply issues that it had a content consequence on DRAM as well. And I think there's some -- perhaps it can only get better, maybe that's my summary there."

The rationale, obviously, for us having a plain clean is all about an adjacent strategy for the marketplace is considerably more fragmented than the etch marketplace. The competitive dynamic is tough. The growth, as you quite rightly pointed out in your question, is occurring at a pace that is faster than over all WFE growth. And that reflects to, a large extent, the transitions that have been occurring now for the last 2 or 3 years, particularly at the front end from batch- to single-wafer processing. That is a trend that is kind of reaching the end of its most obvious kind of transition. So I think maybe in the '13 or '14 timeline, we'll see a single-wafer clean segment that is much more in tune with the pace of growth as the rest of wafer fab. As I articulated in my prepared comments, I feel like we've got a very competitive product portfolio, and we have meaningful strength and presence in the backside bevel and back-end-of-line clean applications. The area of focus for us, which unfortunately coincides with significant amounts of this batch to single wafer transition, is we are addressing some gaps in terms of products capability that, I think, in the 20-nanometer or sub-20-nanometer nodes spending situations will give us a lot more upside. But front-end-of-line is clearly not the competitive strength for our company today that it needs to be, that this it isn't the competitive strength that our back-end-of-line  segment in clean is."

One of the interesting dynamics that I think we're all sensitive to is although we're looking at this thing called DRAM and saying bit growth of the 30% to 35% range, if you kind of get underneath that in each of the segments, PC DRAM bit growth this year is probably only about 15%. And then, you look at service work stations, cellphones and set-top boxes, each one of those has a bit growth expansion of more than 60, and the DRAM bit growth in tablets is above 100%, at least in terms of the modeling that we have. And so it's not going to take that much but something kind of needs to give clearly, and there's a mix of consumer dynamics with ultrabooks and a broader kind of notebook conversation.

I mean, we have a view that etch and clean both stand to benefit from the transition, and that's a process time commentary, as well as a process steps commentary for 3D devices, and it's always incredibly difficult to try and speak to a consequence in terms of size of a marketplace. And the first thing that we can do, which is maybe the only thing I can speak to today, is to communicate how we believe the amount of process time will modify going from a plainar to 3D structure in NAND. And we believe that in etch and in single-wafer clean, process times could increase by 15% or so on the device integration schemes that we're working with customers on today. Now whether that translates itself into 15% increase in the TAM really is a byproduct of what happens to other segments and their process times. And it's a byproduct of the pricing on the systems that are sold to satisfy those capacity needs. But at a very basic process commentary, all things being equal, we think it's beneficial, and we think it's beneficial to the tune of about 15%."

The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.
Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment of market size; wafer fab equipment spending; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations, as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies; our aspirations of the benefits of our planned merger with Novellus; our intentions for research and development activities; our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market share, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins, operating profit, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.
There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of those factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All forward-looking statements are based on current information, and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. [Operator Instructions]

Thanks for joining the call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year as Lam shipments, revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS results met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Relative to these specifics, shipments for the quarter were approximately $713 million, up 27% from the December quarter and indicative of improving customer demand across all product lines and most notably, in the foundry space.
The breakdown by application and market segment was as follows. Applications for the 4x technology node and below represented 91% of overall system shipments, and the memory segment accounted for 40% of all systems shipments, with NAND at 30% and DRAM at 10%. Foundry accounted for 53% of overall system shipments, while logic and other constituted the balance of 7%.
March quarter revenues came in at the high end of our guidance range at $659 million, up 13% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was at 40.9%, up sequentially from 40.1% and is consistent with our expectations of customer concentration and mix, offsetting improvements in factory utilization from the increased business levels.
As planned, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased to approximately $197 million versus $180 million in the December quarter. More than 70% of this incremental spend was focused on next-generation R&D and the customer-facing activity that surround and support it. The balance of the operating expense change was attributable to higher variable compensation expenses associated with higher profit levels, as well as expenses related to market appreciation of deferred compensation plan assets.
Lam intends to mitigate overall exposure relative to market fluctuations impacting these plans, and this quarter is no exception. The increased operating expenses related to these plans were substantively offset by increased income in other income and expense.
As we indicated on our last call, we remain committed to keeping Lam standalone operating expenses at or below $200 million per quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $73 million versus $54 million in the December quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.1%, slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was 20.4% compared to 21.8% in the prior quarter.
On a Lam standalone basis, we estimate the June quarter tax rate to be in the mid-teen, bringing our fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate to around 20%. This rate would be favorably impacted by approximately 2% should Congress extend the federal R&D tax credit prior to the end of our fiscal year.
Based on a share count of approximately 121 million shares, March quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.06. Our EPS results were impacted primarily by the favorable operating results.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $0.38. The GAAP results this quarter include both acquisition and integration costs associated with the Novellus transaction, as well as costs resulting from a customer bankruptcy filing. As has been our practice, the amortization of convertible note discounts are also included. A complete reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's press release.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments, of $2.6 billion versus $2.4 billion last quarter. During the quarter, we settled a structured share repurchase agreement and received $79 million in cash, and we also delivered cash from operations of $146 million in the March quarter versus $169 million in the December quarter.
DSO for the quarter were 65 days, down from 72 days in the prior quarter, and inventory turns of 4.2 represented an improvement from the prior quarter end performance of 3.7 turns. Our deferred revenue this quarter grew by $54 million, to end March at $246 million, excluding approximately $19 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. 
Noncash expenses include, among other items, $16 million per equity compensation and $23 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 3,900 regular full-time employees.
In closing and similar to the December quarter, our ability to buy back shares this quarter was very limited due to restrictions relating to the pending Novellus transaction. We've repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for about $12.5 million and look forward to resuming more substantive share repurchases shortly after the May 10 Novellus shareholder vote.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his perspective on the quarter."

As we just articulated, Lam successfully delivered on its financial commitments for the March quarter.

Specifically, this includes significant momentum on the integration planning with Novellus and progress demonstrating results from continued investments designed to extend our technical differentiation and advance longer-term growth. 
The solid performance and execution, we believe, illustrate a high level of focus throughout the organization, and I would like to recognize and thank employees and the management teams of both companies for this extraordinary achievement and for laying the foundation for what we believe will be a very important year for the combined company. I will share more with you on each of these subjects shortly, but first, would like to refresh our views on the industry environments.
Our view of wafer fabrication equipment spending has not materially changed since our last earnings call. We still expect spending within a range of $30 billion to $32 billion in 2012, and based on the plans our customers are communicating to us today, we would look for spending to be relatively balanced between the first and second half of the calendar year, with less customer concentration beyond the June quarter.
Demand for leading-edge logic capacity continues to strengthen as IBM and fabless companies compete to supply power efficiency in the high performance devices for the mobile market. For the foundries, given the strong demand environments, we now project they will add between 85,000 and 90,000 new wafer starts per month of 32-, 28-nanometer capacity this year, which would translate into ending 2012 with capacity at this node of 220,000 to 240,000 wafer starts per month. 
Using 65-nanometer as a baseline, foundries will have added between 250,000 and 300,000 wafer starts per month of capacity throughout the life cycle of that node. Associated with IBM's transitioning more of their leading-edge capacity to foundries since the 45-nanometer node and the broader demand profile for consumer devices, we would expect total lifetime capacity added for the 28-nanometer node will exceed the historical range.
Turning to the DRAM segments. Our view of the demand drivers has not changed considerably. We still anticipate muted PC unit growth, reflecting the hard disk drive shortages, a cautious corporate refresh cycle and subdued content growth. Consistent with our prior commentary, DRAM, WFE spending will be comprised almost entirely from capacity conversions in 2012. 
Considering this, we would expect that bit growth for 2012 is in the lower 30% range versus our prior view of the mid to upper 30% range. Needless to say, should PC volumes expand later in the year, supply shortages will likely lead to DRAM price increases and the manufacturers will typically begin adding new capacity at that time. This could occur towards the end of the year.
For NAND, we continue to forecast bit growth in the range of 65% in 2012, with a higher proportion of capacity conversions versus new capacity additions relative to 2011. As a result, we are still projecting a modest decline in NAND's WFE spend year-over-year, which reflects our customers' plans to maintain a healthy balance of supply and demand. 
Combined, this supports a relatively stable total WFE spending outlook. This is the result of several factors, including the broadening of semiconductor demand drivers, consolidation among the customer base, cycle time improvements from the equipment companies and the prudent management to spending plans by the customer to align with the demand outlook. As a result, cycles are potentially shaped less by industry-induced supply, demand imbalances and more by changes in the macroeconomic environment and consumer confidence. 
At this point, the current economic outlook for 2013 suggests a more likely slightly positive macro environment relative to 2012, supporting the potential for stability and growth in our markets. Given that Lam's market share is relatively balanced across each of the market segments, with one exception, our continued execution would have us stand to benefit should the upside scenarios play out.
Collectively, this is positive news. However, while the top-down view of WFE spending is characterized by relative stability there's quite a bit of change going on beneath the surface. For our customers, the mounting cost challenges we've described previously are driven in large parts by the levels of device complexity required to deliver lower power, longer battery life and increased functionality demanded by the consumer markets.
For equipment suppliers, these trends present both opportunities and challenges, whereby success is predicated on the ability to partner with customers to quickly sell these increasingly complex technical and productivity challenges. Customer trust and partnership is ever more important.
As we have talked about for most of the past year, now is a critical time for us to leverage our strength in developing solutions that address our customers' most critical technical challenges. We continue to see opportunities in each of our core product areas that should position us to execute against our 3- to 5-year market share objectives of a 3 to 5 percentage point gain in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points gain in single-wafer clean. 
In etch, we have held the leading position in the conductor space for more than a decade and believe that we are well positioned for future opportunities with the expansion of patenting techniques and the transition to FinFET structures. In each of these areas, the ability to tightly control feature dimensions and depth uniformity across the wafer is crucial for device performance, and we believe Lam is currently the market leader for critical patterning, gates and isolation applications across both memory and foundry segments. 
In dielectric etch, we are focused on strengthening our product and process capabilities to expand share over the next several years. Accordingly, in memory, we continue to focus on the next generation of high aspect ratio structures. We're leveraging our demonstrated strengths to position the company for growth opportunities as NAND's manufacturers plan to transition to the 3D structures. In Foundry/Logic, we are targeting growth in back-end-of-line interconnect applications by advancing our capabilities to deliver solutions for both performance and productivity.
In single-wafer clean, our ability to tightly control the cleaning process has led to technical differentiation in a few key application areas. As a result, we currently hold leading positions in the areas of wafer backside and bevel cleaning and the back-end-of-line. 
We are developing capabilities necessary to expand our share in the front-end-of-line by translating some of our process tuning capabilities in etch and applying them to clean processing. We're also focused on enhancing the productivity of our clean systems to more effectively compete for a broader range of applications and expect to deliver differentiated process results to support accelerated market share momentum moving through the sub-20-nanometer node. 
Our product strategy remains focused on delivering best-of-breed technology and productivity solutions to our customers. This objective is core to our market share expansion strategy. As we pursue these opportunities, we have communicated to you our commitments to keeping quarterly operating expenses below $200 million for this calendar year. We are pleased to have delivered that in the March quarter and are reiterating that commitment relative to Lam's standalone business as we move forward.
I'll share with you now our outlook for the June quarter: shipments of $725 million, plus or minus $25 million; revenues of $710 million, plus or minus $20 million; gross margin at 41.5%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 13.5%, plus or minus 1%; and earnings per share of $0.67, plus or minus $0.05. In anticipation of closing the transaction with Novellus, I would like to clearly state that the guidance I just provided represents projections for Lam as a standalone company. We expect to present our view for the combined company on our July conference call.
Prior to opening this call for Q&A, I will provide a brief update on the status of the Novellus acquisition. As you may have read in our proxy statements, we have scheduled our Special Shareholder Meeting for May 10, and thus far, we have received regulatory approvals from all required countries with the exception of China. We continue to expect that the acquisition will close within the June quarter. 
At this point, integration planning is well underway and is progressing as planned. We've established an integration team comprised with executives and senior level employees from both companies and supplement facts, where valuable, with experienced external resources. We have completed an assessment of each company's culture, organizational structures and business processes in detail and determined there are more similarities than differences. We have made and communicated decisions relative to these subjects through both companies already. We have defined a set of objectives around prioritized areas of focus to begin immediately on day 1 following transaction closure, and as we've discussed in the past, ensuring this transaction is seamless for our customers remains a critical priority. 
We have validated our opportunity to achieve our target of $100 million in annualized costs synergies exiting 2013, which we plan to commence at some level immediately on closing and accelerate over the 6 quarter period. Through these activities, it is fair to say we are now more confident in the strategic rationale of this transaction and the value proposition we believe it brings our customers and shareholders.
Given the expected timing for deal closure and our immediate focus on both integration and our customers, we have decided to hold our 2012 analyst event in the November time frame rather than during the SEMICON West conference this year. This move will give us the opportunity to present you a more comprehensive view of the combined company and our future growth plans. We are excited about the opportunities that this transaction presents for the combined company, and we look forward to keeping you updated over the second half of the calendar year on our progress.
I would like to express once more my tremendous satisfaction for the company's accomplishments in the March quarter, a period which included a leadership transition, the start of significant integration planning for the single largest transaction in the company's history and an ever challenging industry environment. Our performance illustrates the strength of both our employee base and leadership team, which are obviously core to our success in the years to come.
With that, Ernie and I will open the call for questions."

And so I don't think there's a fundamental message for us to be communicating today relative to shipments momentum in the guidance that we've given for June. I do think that the shipments for Lam, certainly, as we're modeling that against the wafer fab outlook that we've communicated, we're expecting the shipments for Lam are approximately kind of equal first half and second half. And at a segment level, that would probably translate for us to have Foundry/Logic first half maybe in the mid-50s, a 55, 45 split approximately and memory maybe slightly in the opposite directions. So 47, 48 range for first half, 52 to 53 second half. So that's about the best that I can probably give you on the shipments at this time."

Relative to leverage, Jim, I think that there's clearly 2 things going on today. There's the conversation about leverage, and then, there's the conversation about customer concentration. And we worked really hard to deliver the same variability and cost structure today that we did last year, 2 years ago, 5 years ago, 10 years ago. The outsourcing initiative is still alive and well in our company. And to illustrate that point, when I look at the shipments momentum in the company, March over December, we had a pretty sizable increase in the shipments percentage of the company, and yet the underlying gross spending in the company associated with factory and field increased only by a single-digit percentage. So there's a very healthy statement of leverage in the kind of transactional base cost structure of the company. What is challenging for us and perhaps even more challenging for us in the midst of our peer equipment companies because of our kind of relative lack of position in certain segments is customer concentration. And we certainly were sitting here 3 months ago speaking to you about the fact that customer concentration was extraordinarily high in the March quarter. The outlook at that time had us conclude that by the time we got to June that would be kind of much more normalized, then we'd expect some pickup. And as I think everybody on the call knows that since that time, the public announcements that have been made by customers have actually kind of stretched the concentration into the June quarter. And that's why the message is, today what it is, I feel pretty good about the margin uptick for the company. I think when you look at kind of the sequential performance, March to June, that we've guided, the absolute dollars of revenue, that pickup is reasonable. But the headline still for the first half is customer concentration is still meaningfully above the average of last year. And when we look at the full year, I don't know that I would conclude that actually the full calendar year gets close to kind of the participation levels, broadly, that we saw in 2011. Meaning, that in spite of the fact that things get better, I don't think they get back to the same level of participation that we saw in 2011. And maybe just to frame that, our assumption on wafer fabrication equipment spending, so I kind of talked about an outlook of the year of 30 to 32. We're assuming the top 3 guys are in the $18 billion to $20 billion range combined."

But I was saying when I gave you some numbers on first half, second half memory that we were thinking about the 47, 48 level for memory first half and second half, 52, 53 range. And clearly, the outlook for the company is based on the complete sets of investments, DRAM and NAND. When we look at the memory segments, clearly DRAM is all about conversion and upgrades, and there's very little incremental capacity this year. I think, certainly, as we look at plants today, 20,000 wafer starts of addition in DRAM would probably on the optimistic side in outlook. So clearly when it comes to capacity adds, we're making an assumption today of about 130,000 wafer starts of additions, decent amount of upgrades. And in terms of upside, I would say there are some obvious moving parts. One of them is ultrabooks. And there appears to be, as best as I can tell, some pretty helpful AFP trajectories that might be timed well to be a catalyst for ultrabook demand around kind of back-to-school season. So I think we're sitting on the 800, 900 range and may be heading down to 800, 700 as a healthy catalyst. So there's plenty of room, clearly, for ultra books for SSD broadly as a percentage of mobile devices to gain momentum. But the price point is maybe still not quite where it needs to be. So we're assuming you have to be in the kind of $100 range to be a catalyst against the hard disk in solid state drives, and we're probably at about 140 to 110 depending on whether you take a commercial view of configurations versus the consumer. I think there is some upside in DRAM, but it's kind of too early to tell, frankly. And for me, feels much more about exactly what plays out second half in the hard disk space, how that plays out and impacts content because it appears like as kind of densities in hard disks have kind of contracted to manage the supply issues that it had a content consequence on DRAM as well. And I think there's some -- perhaps it can only get better, maybe that's my summary there."

The rationale, obviously, for us having a plain clean is all about an adjacent strategy for the marketplace is considerably more fragmented than the etch marketplace. The competitive dynamic is tough. The growth, as you quite rightly pointed out in your question, is occurring at a pace that is faster than over all WFE growth. And that reflects to, a large extent, the transitions that have been occurring now for the last 2 or 3 years, particularly at the front end from batch- to single-wafer processing. That is a trend that is kind of reaching the end of its most obvious kind of transition. So I think maybe in the '13 or '14 timeline, we'll see a single-wafer clean segment that is much more in tune with the pace of growth as the rest of wafer fab. As I articulated in my prepared comments, I feel like we've got a very competitive product portfolio, and we have meaningful strength and presence in the backside bevel and back-end-of-line clean applications. The area of focus for us, which unfortunately coincides with significant amounts of this batch to single wafer transition, is we are addressing some gaps in terms of products capability that, I think, in the 20-nanometer or sub-20-nanometer nodes spending situations will give us a lot more upside. But front-end-of-line is clearly not the competitive strength for our company today that it needs to be, that this it isn't the competitive strength that our back-end-of-line segment in clean is."

I mean, we -- I think I answered very specifically the last time. I think anything above the 40% bit growth drives capacity. I think today I'd say anything above 35% drives capacity. One of the interesting dynamics that I think we're all sensitive to is although we're looking at this thing called DRAM and saying bit growth of the 30% to 35% range, if you kind of get underneath that in each of the segments, PC DRAM bit growth this year is probably only about 15%. And then, you look at service work stations, cellphones and set-top boxes, each one of those has a bit growth expansion of more than 60, and the DRAM bit growth in tablets is above 100%, at least in terms of the modeling that we have. And so it's not going to take that much but something kind of needs to give clearly, and there's a mix of consumer dynamics with ultrabooks and a broader kind of notebook conversation. There's tablets and the broader notebook, and there's a supply uncertainty that makes it difficult to predict.

They June quarter a of Lam Research, as you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are reflected in the press release issued ear",1271,"Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. They June quarter a of Lam Research, as you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are reflected in the press release issued earlier today, include only 20 days of Novellus is activity. With that in mind, I'd like to begin my remarks today by reviewing Lam's standalone performance for the June quarter as it relates to the guidance we provided on our April call. 
We ended our fiscal year with solid performance and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for all metrics provided. Specifically, shipments were approximately $727 million for the quarter, up 2% from the March quarter, supported by capacity additions for leading edge foundry customers and DRAM capacity conversions for the 2x and 3x technology nodes. Although moderating, leading edge NAND capacity additions continues to be a meaningful part of the company shipment profile. 
Turning to the breakdown by application and market segment for Lam's standalone shipments, applications for sub 4x technology nodes represented 96% of overall system shipments. Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total shipments while the memory segment accounted for 46% total shipments divided between NAND at 18% and DRAM at 28%. Lastly, logic and other constituted the balance of 6%. 
Revenue in the June quarter was $716 million, up 9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41.9%, up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $195 million versus $197 million in the March quarter. The operating expense level reflects our continued investment in the strategic products and projects offset by favorability related to deferred compensation plan obligations resulting from stock market decline. Lamb attempts to mitigate overall plan exposure relative to market fluctuation and the decreased operating expenses were said that in other income and expense. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $106 million versus $73 million in the prior quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 14.7%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on a positive progression from the 11.1% in the March 2012 quarter. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was in line with our expectations at 16.5% compared to the 20.4% from the March quarter. Based on the share count of approximately 117 million shares, June quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.75, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.03. I'll note once again that all of the date I just provide is for Lam's standalone and is intended to be compared to our previously provided June quarter guidance. 
Prior to presenting the balance sheet for the combined company, I'd like to address a few housekeeping items. First, as we think about fiscal year 2013 as the new Lam, we currently contemplate tax rate in the midteens. This estimate is subject to further revision as we more thoroughly complete tax planning activities for the combined company and will be favorably impacted should the federal R&D tax credit be expanded. Relative to Novellus on a standalone basis, shipments for the June quarter were approximately $309 million while the combined company recorded it $816 million in shipments for the same period, which includes $89 million of Novellus shipments made after June 4. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. The results that follow represent the combined company. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments of $3 billion versus $2.6 billion for Lam's standalone in the prior quarter. This includes approximately $1.1 billion acquired as a result of the Novellus transaction, offset by the impact of our June quarter share repurchase activity, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Relative to DSO and inventory turns while there has been no significant change in the underlying operational performance of either company, June quarter financial results are significantly impacted by the 20 day stop period for Novellus and are not helpful for understanding the companies overall performance. We foresee a normal return to more normal external metrics in the September quarter and we will discuss them at that time. 
We ended the June quarter with deferred revenue of $335 million excluding approximately $23 million in shipments to Japanese customers that were revenue in future quarters. Approximately $87 million of the deferred revenue balance relates to Novellus products. Combined company non-cash expenses include, among other items, $29 million for equity compensation and $35 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $37 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees, including approximately 2,750 Novellus employees. 
During the June quarter, we spent approximately $676 million for share repurchases and took delivery of approximately 16 million shares common stock. In the September quarter, we expect to receive an additional 2 million to 3 million shares associative our June quarter expenditures resulting in an effective purchase price between $36 and $38 per share. These deliveries will be in addition to any new September quarter repurchases made under the company as ongoing...
[Technical Difficulty]
Repurchase program. Before turning over the call for Martin, I'd like to discuss the impact of purchase price accounting rules related to the Novellus transaction. In particular, I'd like to call your attention to 3 areas where you will see the largest impact to our results. 
I'll explain more about the June quarter impact in a few minutes, which in turn provides the baseline for the September quarter guidance that Martin will be discussing in a few minutes. 
First, the transaction required that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities be recorded at current fair value including the inventory acquired from Novellus. This includes finished goods, work in process and raw materials and for the next 2 to 3 quarters, we will have revenue recognized with cost of goods sold values that are higher than the Novellus historical cost. These differences will be noted as a non-GAAP adjustments. 
The second area that was impacted by the transaction was revenue. Because of Novellus and Lam had differing for submission revenue policies, there will be a delay in recognizing revenue for some Novellus Systems as we transition to Lam's customer acceptance base model. Additionally, due to purchase price accounting rules, we will not be able to recognize the majority of Novellu's deferred revenue that was recorded on its balance sheet as of the day of the transaction close since the tools had already been physically delivered to customers. This Novellus deferred revenue totaled approximately $37 million. 
We expect that these timing differences will be fully normalized within a 2 to 3 quarter period and until then, we'll provide an estimate of their impacts. The circumstances in no way impact the timing of collectibility of any customer receivables. Finally, our non-GAAP results will now also exclude the amortization of intangible assets we acquired and valued as of the date of acquisition. 
I'd also like to call your attention to the fact that our GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense will now include the expense associated with the coupon interest of the convertible debt we acquired as part of the transaction, currently estimated at approximately $4.5 million per quarter. As has been the case, our non-GAAP results will continue to exclude acquisition and integration related costs, the amortization of discounts for both companies convertible notes and other certain nonrecurring items. Please refer to be non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for a complete review of the exclusion. With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."
30655,213576934,330857,"Lam Research Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immed",1889,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immediately began executing on the objectives we established for the combined company while at the same time, ensuring continued focus on commitments made to our customers as two previously standalone companies. 
Before I expand on our progress internally, I'd first like to share our views on the current business environment. Since our April call, optimism around macroeconomic strength has waned somewhat and while views for 2012 GDP remain in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, estimates for 2013 growth appear to have weakened to below 3%, a level that is now more consistent with a stable growth outlook year-over-year with potential, we believe, for electronics growth in 2013 in excess of 2012. 
It is premature to start predicting 2013 application equipment spending with any certainty clearly. But our initial modeling of ICU unit supply and demand would cause us to anticipate that spend would remain around the $30 billion level for a full straight year. Continued concerns over the euro debt crisis, unemployment in the U.S. and questions about the level of China's growth outlook, all have the potential to constrain or negatively impact consumer electronics demand. We expect our customers to continue to focus on aligning their capacity additions with their own view of that demand outlook. One reasonable conclusion is that our near-term future is quite unsettled due to these macro factors. As such, we would now expect 2012 fabrication equipment spending to be at the low-end of our previously communicated $30 billion to $32 billion range. 
Turning first to the Foundry segments. We continue to expect foundry WFE spending within a range of $12 billion to $13 billion, driven primarily by demand for leading edge capacity. Specifically, we are still projecting approximately 90,000 wafer starts per month of new 32, 28-nanometer capacity will be added throughout 2012, which supports our prior view for exiting the year with between 220,000 and 240,000 wafer starts per month of 32, 28 capacity. Given what appears to be a healthy demand for devices manufactured at this technology node, we continue to expect more than 300,000 wafer starts at total capacity to be ultimately installed, a figure that will surpass all prior year foundry nodes. 
Investment timing will depend on several factors including economic uncertainty, competitive dynamics and production performance of our customers. However, our views suggests plenty of runway remains for 28-nanometer spending. Relative to the markets, the leading edge 22-nanometer production ramp continues. Now our outlook for WFE spend in the segment has marginally declined as opportunities for reuse of existing equipment appear to have increased and the proportion of total CapEx for shelf space is now greater than previously expected. Likely, this bodes well for equipment spending in 2015. 
Our view of the DRAM segments have not substantially changed. We continue to see muted investment level supporting the growth in the low 30% range this year. With virtually no new plants capacity additions in 2012, the remains the potential for supply constraints exiting 2012. Additionally, the sustained economic pressures caused by the proximity of DRAM selling prices to manufacturing costs motivate customers to convert capacity to the most competitive bleeding edge capability. While this scenario could result in higher levels of DRAM spending in 2013, spending levels will largely be a function of the demand environments, again, the macros are likely to dominate. 
Finally, looking at the NAND segments. We have lowered our second half WFE spend forecast as a couple of customers appear to have delayed their investment plans slightly from the second half of 2012 into early 2013. We are projecting NAND's WFE spend to decline by approximately $1 billion year-on-year and our figure is likely closer to $2 billion. While our 2012 forecast for NAND's demand drivers such as smartphones and tablet devices have remain healthy, the amount of NAND's capacity in place today we believe can meet the consensus of approximately 65% this year. 
The pricing environment can certainly influence investment decisions. NAND's pricing progressively worsened throughout the quarter, although we started to see pricing stabilize the implications of that are not yet completely clear. 
To summarize, despite today's muted macroeconomic environments, our 2012 WFE spend forecast in the $30 billion range is close to historic peak levels. The outlook for the 28-nanometer foundry investment looks good through 2018, the drivers for Lam's capacity additions look good in the long-term, but as stated, we're seeing some timing adjustments recently slowing investments. The DRAM and the microprocessor world share PC as the primary underlying demand driver and we consider it more likely than not, there is positive unit momentum here in 2013.
Taken together, we remain cautiously optimistic about IC unit demand next year but acknowledge the answer to give our global economy and share the common interest to see these macro questions get answered in the coming months. 
Turning now to Lam's the business performance. While relatively few new application decisions were made by our customers in the first half of this year, we made positive progress towards a number of targeted growth applications while successfully defending critical positions in etch, single wafer clean and now deposition. 
To capture a few headlines. In PE CVD, we gained a few critical back end logic applications by demonstrating minimal low key film damage combined with people process results at high productivity. Combined with our strong position in conductor active in steps, we are well-positioned for the foundry transition to 20-nanometer. Our engagements with leading NAND manufacturers position us well for opportunities resulting from the 3D devices broadly. In etch, we gained momentum for high aspect ratio etches, considered one of the most challenging etch processes. We have demonstrated the ability to provide CD and profile performance without compromising productivity. As a result of these capabilities, we are able to strengthen our position in memory applications and are well-positioned for next generation DRAM decisions and 3D NAND applications. 
In deposition, the need to fill these high aspect ratio features without voids has become increasingly critical to device performance. We believe we are well-positioned to extend our leadership in constant CVD with our differentiate extremely bill technology which delivers a seam-free fill using low tungsten. Similarly, in PECVD, our ability to deposit multiple layers of ultrasmooth film stacks as high productivity has resulted in multiple customer engagements for 3D NAND device developments. 
Finally, in single wafer clean, we continue our next-generation product development efforts which are well underway. These systems combined defense writing chemical technologies with targeted newly developed technical productivity capabilities that will position us to better compete across a more comprehensive set of single wafer clean applications. 
As stated before, given the current wafer fab environment, the mix and timing of customer equipment selections and spending, we expect to ship the market share will relatively be neutral to etch deposition and single wafer clean this year. The headlines I just described reflect our continued focus on our longer-term growth objectives for gaining 3 to 5 percentage points in etch, 5 to 10 percentage points in single wafer clean, and now, 4 to 8 percentage points in deposition over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Overall, we're pleased to report again that reflecting back on the first half of the year, the Lam and Novellus continue to execute to each company's established business plans and records, also engaging fully on integration planning and activities associated with closing the transaction. We achieved our objective to transition on day 1 without disruptions to our customers, suppliers or employees, which we consider our highest priority. 
With the merger now complete, we are focused on completing as one company on its successful integration and executing the comprehensive plans targeted to achieve accelerated growth and profitability. Our priorities must always include building customer trust, partnership and collaboration, without which, our plans are less probable and targeted results, we believe, less sustainable. 
We began implementing plans to realize cost synergies immediately, starting with areas where we had identified duplicative resources and services. Although not the primary definition of success for this transaction, we are already spending less money together than we would have done separately. We are on plan and are pleased with the pace of our progress thus far. In the coming quarters, will share more specifics related to our performance against target saving of $100 million on an annualized basis exiting 2013. 
Our cost reduction synergies are anticipated to deliver benefits each and every quarter this year and next. They are not linear in their impacts, however, and specifically in the middle of next calendar year, they include a step function reduction of costs related to business process and systems streamlining. We are executing plans to integrate key business, management systems and infrastructure which we started to be largely completed within the next 12 months. Especially important is our focus on employees during a period of transition of this scale, together our focus has been rewarded by successes in our efforts to retain key employees as we move through the integration process. 
Lastly, subsequent to reaching the June 4, 2012, acquisition closing, we were finally able to begin our efforts in earnest to engage with customers on a broad set of opportunities uniquely created by this merging to accelerate their success and ours. As we spend more time meeting jointly with our customers, our confidence in achieving our growth objectives for the combined company has grown higher. We look forward to sharing further details on our plans to achieve substantial revenue synergies over the coming years during our upcoming analyst event which we have now schedule for November 8. 
I'll now share with you our combined company non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter and provide some context that we consider important. Shipments of $950 million, plus or minus, $30 million, revenues of $900 million, plus or minus, $30 million, gross margin at 42.5% plus or minus 1%, operating profit at 10% plus or minus 1.5% and earnings per share of $0.40 plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of 183 million shares. Worthy of note, the revenue recognition changes that Ernie discussed for Novellus products will also impact our financial statements in the September quarter. 
The September quarter guidance I just provided would be improved by the following amounts where it not for the revenue recognition changes. Approximately $100 million of revenue, approximately 1 percentage point of gross margin and approximately $0.25 of earnings per share. 
I would like to reemphasize Lam's commitment on a standalone basis to maintain operating expenses at or below the $200 million level through the remainder of calendar year 2012 and we would expect overall OpEx levels to remain fairly flat in the December quarter from the level implied by our September guidance today. 
In closing, I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to the leadership and broad employee population of the combined company who have worked tirelessly to support our stated goals and achievements and thank all of our stakeholders for their continued patience and support to our company through this period of significant transition. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

We clearly just began the process of assimilating the 2 companies and certainly, at this point in time, we remain absolutely committed to the full portfolio products that define Lam Research and Novellus as two standalone companies. As you might expect, we have clearly stated ambition to be #1 in the market share in all segments that we compete in. And it's true, in at least one Lam business and 1 or 2 deposition businesses from Novellus that we're not the #1 player. So we clearly, as a management team, have to work ahead of us to rationalize the past to being successful against the definition of success that is I just described. So the message today to our customers and to our investment community is we're absolutely committed the portfolio products that are active in both companies and we've got some work ahead.

It's at the low end of the range, we would now slightly modify the first half, second half commentary and say that the first half, we believe, is slightly stronger than the second half and of course, in percentages I would put the first half in the low 50s and the second half the high 40s. So that's how you should think about first half second half at this point of time and I would say that the ratio I just gave you, the low 50s and the high 40s first half, second half WFE, is accentuated a little in the foundries. For December, clearly, there's a lot of moving parts and it would be premature for us to be specific about guidance today.

We have a huge amount of energy invested in that particular issue. I will say if there's ever a segment of our business of our company where the risk profile is lowest and the reason and that's true is because clean is a yield enhancing investment by the customer. It's not a feature creating investment for the customer. And so even in a scenario where you didn't synchronize necessarily a new product to a decision or a first phase EQY decision, clean is one of the segments where if you can demonstrate value to the customer in terms of yield solutions in excess of a previously selected equipment set, then you have a much better chance of establishing positions and ultimately displacing the competition. If there's ever a place in the business where you feel better around the risk you've just spoken to, clean is definitely the second."

The biggest influence is the design decisions of the customers of the foundries. Everything that we've been able to kind of analyze would cause us to conclude what we're concluding relative to the 300,000 wafer starts for 28-nanometer. I think at least one other equipment company has messaged something very similar recently. And I think the foundry public announcement have tended to talk about 28-nanometer spending in '13 and 20 beginning to production ramp in '13, but primarily in '14. So it kind of hangs together. It's the best we can tell. That all being said, clearly, every company their work is motivated to achieve lowest-cost unit output and if a 20-nanometer solution achieves that, that may be their motivation. But again, I'd put that in context of the WFE message that in an earlier question, the cost consequence of 10,000 wafer start addition of 20 nanometers is in the range of 30% to 40% more expensive than 28. So it's not an easy potato. It's definitely stressing what has been a fairly kind of simple set of decisions historically."

The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is available on our website at lamresearch.com.
Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment of market size; wafer fab equipment spending; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies; our aspirations of the benefits with our merger with Novellus; our intentions for research and development activities, our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market shares, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins operating profits, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.
There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of these factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All forward-looking statements are based on current information and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them.

We ended our fiscal year with solid performance and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for all metrics provided.

Although moderating, leading edge NAND capacity additions continue to be a meaningful part of the company shipment profile. 
Turning to the breakdown by application and market segment for Lam's standalone shipments, applications for sub 4x technology nodes represented 96% of overall system shipments. Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments while the Memory segment accounted for 46% total shipments divided between NAND at 18% and DRAM at 28%. Lastly, Logic and other constituted the balance of 6%. 
Revenue in the June quarter was $716 million, up 9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41.9%, up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $195 million versus $197 million in the March quarter. The operating expense level reflects our continued investment in the strategic products and projects offset by favorability related to deferred compensation plan obligations resulting from stock market decline. Lamb attempts to mitigate overall plan exposure relative to market fluctuation and the decreased operating expenses were substantially offset in other income and expense. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $106 million versus $73 million in the prior quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 14.7%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on a positive progression from the 11.1% in the March 2012 quarter. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was aligned with our expectations at 16.5% compared to the 20.4% from in the March quarter. Based on a share count of approximately 117 million shares, June quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.75, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.03. I'll note once again that all of the data I've just provide is for Lam's standalone and is intended to be compared to our previously provided June quarter guidance. 
Prior to presenting the balance sheet for the combined company, I'd like to address a few housekeeping items. First, as we think about fiscal year 2013, as the new Lam, we currently contemplate tax rate in the midteens. This estimate is subject to further revision as we more thoroughly complete tax planning activities for the combined company and would be favorably impacted should the Federal R&D tax credit be extended. Relative to Novellus on a standalone basis, shipments for the June quarter were approximately $309 million while the combined company recorded it $816 million in shipments for the same period, which includes $89 million of Novellus shipments made after June 4. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. The results that follow represent the combined company. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments of $3 billion versus $2.6 billion for Lam's standalone in the prior quarter. This includes approximately $1.1 billion acquired as a result of the Novellus transaction, offset by the impact of our June quarter share repurchase activity, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Relative to DSO and inventory turns while there has been no significant change in the underlying operational performance of either company, June quarter financial results are significantly impacted by the 20 day stop period for Novellus and are not helpful for understanding the companies overall performance. We foresee a return to more normal external metrics in the September quarter and we will discuss them at that time. 
We ended the June quarter with deferred revenue of $335 million excluding approximately $23 million in shipments to Japanese customers that were revenue in future quarters. Approximately $87 million of the deferred revenue balance relates to Novellus products. Combined company non-cash expenses include, among other items, $29 million for equity compensation and $35 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $37 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees, including approximately 2,750 Novellus employees. 
During the June quarter, we spent approximately $676 million for share repurchases and took delivery of approximately 16 million shares common stock. In the September quarter, we expect to receive an additional 2 to 3 million shares associated with our June quarter expenditures resulting in an effective purchase price between $36 and $38 per share. These deliveries will be in addition to any new September quarter repurchases made under the company as ongoing repurchase program. 
Before turning over the call to Martin, I'd like to discuss the impact of purchase price accounting rules related to the Novellus transaction. In particular, I'd like to call your attention to 3 areas where you will see the largest impact to our results. I'll explain more about the June quarter impact in a few minutes, which in turn provides the baseline for the September quarter guidance that Martin will be discussing in a few minutes. 
First, the transaction required that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities be recorded at current fair value including the inventory acquired from Novellus. This includes finished goods, work in process and raw materials and for the next 2 to 3 quarters, we will have revenue recognized with cost of goods sold values that are higher than the Novellus historical cost. These differences will be noted as a non-GAAP adjustment.
The second area that was impacted by the transaction was revenue. Because of Novellus and Lam had differing revenue recognition policies, there will be a delay in recognizing revenue for some Novellus Systems as we transition to Lam's customer acceptance base model. Additionally, due to purchase price accounting rules, we will not be able to recognize the majority of Novellus deferred revenue that was recorded on its balance sheet as of the day of the transaction close, since the tools had already been physically delivered to customers. This Novellus deferred revenue totaled approximately $37 million. 
We expect that these timing differences will be fully normalized within a 2 to 3 quarter period and until then, we'll provide an estimate of their impacts. The circumstances in no way impact the timing or collectibility of any customer receivables. Finally, our non-GAAP results will now also exclude the amortization of intangible assets we acquired and valued as of the date of the acquisition. 
I'd also like to call your attention to the fact that our GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense will now include the expense associated with the coupon interest of the convertible debt we acquired as part of the transaction, currently estimated at approximately $4.5 million per quarter. As has been the case, our non-GAAP results will continue to exclude acquisition and integration related costs, the amortization of discounts for both companies convertible notes and other certain nonrecurring items. Please refer to be non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for a complete review of the exclusion. With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."
30655,213576934,331005,"Lam Research Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immed",1907,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immediately began executing on the objectives we established for the combined company while at the same time, ensuring continued focus on commitments made to our customers as 2 previously standalone companies. 
Before I expand on our progress internally, I'd first like to share our views on the current business environment. Since our April call, optimism around macroeconomic strength has waned somewhat and while views for 2012 GDP remain in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, estimates for 2013 growth appear to have weakened to below 3%, a level that is now more consistent with a stable growth outlook year-over-year with potential, we believe, for electronics growth in 2013 in excess of 2012. 
It is premature to start predicting 2013 wafer fabrication equipment spending with any certainty clearly. But our initial modeling of IC unit supply and demand would cause us to anticipate that spend would remain around the $30 billion level for a full straight year. Continued concerns over the Europe debt crisis, unemployment in the U.S. and questions about the level of China's growth outlook, all have the potential to constrain or negatively impact consumer electronics demand. We expect our customers to continue to focus on aligning their capacity additions with their own view of that demand outlook. One reasonable conclusion is that our near-term future is quite unsettled due to these macro factors. As such, we would now expect 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending to be at the low-end of our previously communicated $30 billion to $32 billion range. 
Turning first to the Foundry segments. We continue to expect Foundry WFE spending within a range of $12 billion to $13 billion, driven primarily by demand for leading edge capacity. Specifically, we are still projecting approximately 90,000 wafer starts per month of new 32, 28-nanometer capacity will be added throughout 2012, which supports our prior view for exiting the year with between 220,000 and 240,000 wafer starts per month of 32/28nm capacity. Given what appears to be a healthy demand for devices manufactured at this technology node, we continue to expect more than 300,000 wafer starts of total capacity to be ultimately installed, a figure that will surpass all prior year Foundry nodes. 
Investment timing will depend on several factors including economic uncertainty, competitive dynamics and production performance of our customers. However, our views suggests plenty of runway remains for 28-nanometer spending. Relative to the Logic markets, the leading edge 22-nanometer production ramp continues. Our outlook for WFE spend in the segment has marginally declined as opportunities for reuse of existing equipment appeared to have increased and the proportion of total CapEx for shelf space is now greater than previously expected. Likely, this bodes well for equipment spending in 2013.
Our view of the DRAM segments have not substantially changed. We continue to see muted investment level supporting the big growth in the low 30% range this year. With virtually no new plant capacity additions in 2012, there remains the potential for supply constraints exiting 2012. Additionally, the sustained economic pressures caused by the proximity of DRAM selling prices to manufacturing costs motivate customers to convert capacity to the most competitive leading edge capability. While this scenario could result in higher levels of DRAM spending in 2013, spending levels will largely be a function of the demand environments. Again, the macros are likely to dominate. 
Finally, looking at the NAND segments. We have lowered our second half WFE spend forecast as a couple of customers appeared to have delayed their investment plans slightly from the second half of 2012 into early 2013. We have projected NAND's WFE spend to decline by approximately $1 billion year-on-year and to date our figure is likely closer to $2 billion. While our 2012 forecast for NAND's demand drivers such as smartphones and tablet devices have remain healthy, the amount of NAND's capacity in place today we believe can meet the consensus big growth estimates of approximately 65% this year. 
The pricing environment can certainly influence investment decisions. NAND's pricing progressively worsened throughout the quarter, although we started to see pricing stabilize. The implications of that are not yet completely clear. 
To summarize, despite today's muted macroeconomic environments, our 2012 WFE spend forecast in the $30 billion range is close to historic peak levels. The outlook for sustains 28-nanometer Foundry investment looks good through 2013, the drivers for Lam's capacity additions look good in the long-term, but as stated, we're seeing some timing adjustments recently slowing investments. The DRAM and the microprocessor world both share PC as a primary underlying demand driver and we consider it more likely than not, there is positive unit momentum here in 2013.
Taken together, we remain cautiously optimistic about IC unit demands next year but acknowledge the uncertainty of our global economy and share the common interest to see these macro questions get answered in the coming months. 
Turning now to Lam's business performance. While relatively few new application decisions were made by our customers in the first half of this year, we made positive progress towards a number of targeted growth applications while successfully defending critical positions in etch, single-wafer clean and NAND deposition. 
To capture a few headlines. In PECVD, we gained a few critical back end Logic applications by demonstrating minimal low key film damage combined with the people process results at high productivity. Combined with our strong position in conductor etch patenting steps, we are well-positioned for the Foundry transition to 20 nanometer. Our engagements with leading NAND manufacturers position us well for opportunities resulting from the 3D devices broadly. In dielectric etch, we gained momentum for high aspect ratio etches, considered one of the most challenging etch processes. We have demonstrated the ability to provide tight CD and profile performance without compromising productivity. As a result of these capabilities, we are able to strengthen our position in memory applications and are well-positioned for next generation DRAM decisions and 3D NAND applications. 
In deposition, the need to fill these very high aspect ratio features without voids has become increasingly critical to device performance. We believe we are well-positioned to extend our leadership in constant tungsten CVD with our differentiated extreme FEOL technology which delivers a seam-free FEOL using low risk stiffly tungsten. Similarly, in PECVD, our ability to deposit multiple layers of ultrasmooth film stacks as high productivity has resulted in multiple customer engagements for 3D NAND device developments. 
Finally, in single wafer clean, we continue our next-generation product development efforts which are well underway. These systems combined a different CD drying and chemical retain technologies with targeted newly developed technical productivity capabilities that will position us to better compete across a more comprehensive set of single wafer clean applications. 
As stated before, given the current wafer fab environment, the mix and timing of customer equipment selections and spending, we expect shipped market share will be relatively be neutral to etch deposition and single wafer clean this year. The headlines I just described reflect our continued focus on our longer-term growth objectives for gaining 3 to 5 percentage points in etch, 5 to 10 percentage points in single wafer clean, and now, 4 to 8 percentage points in deposition over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Overall, we're pleased to report again that reflecting back on the first half of the year, the Lam and Novellus continue to execute to each company's established business plans and records, also engaging fully in integration planning and activities associated with closing the transaction. We achieved our objective to transition on day 1 without disruptions to our customers, suppliers or employees, which we consider our highest priority. 
With the merger now complete, we are focused on completing as one company on its successful integration and executing the comprehensive plans targeted to achieve accelerated growth and profitability. Our priorities must always include building customer trust, partnership and collaboration. Without which, our plans are less probable and targeted results, we believe, less sustainable. 
We began implementing plans to realize cost synergies immediately, starting with areas where we had identified duplicative resources and services. Although not the primary definition of success for this transaction, we are already spending less money together than we would have done separately. We are on plan and are pleased with the pace of our progress thus far. In the coming quarters, we will share more specifics relative to our performance against target saving of $100 million on an annualized basis exiting 2013. 
Our cost reduction synergies are anticipated to deliver benefits each and every quarter this year and next. They are not linear in their impacts, however, and specifically in the middle of next calendar year, they include a step function reduction of costs related to business process and systems streamlining. We are executing plans to integrate key business processes, management systems and infrastructure which we target to be largely completed within the next 12 months. Especially important is our focus on employees during a period of transition of this scale. Together, our focus has been rewarded by successes in our efforts to retain key employees as we move through the integration process. 
Lastly, subsequent to reaching the June 4, 2012, acquisition closing, we were finally able to begin our efforts in earnest to engage with customers on a broad set of opportunities uniquely created by this merging to accelerate their success and ours. As we spend more time meeting jointly with our customers, our confidence in achieving our growth objectives for the combined company has grown higher. We look forward to sharing further details on our plans to achieve substantive revenue synergies over the coming years during our upcoming analyst event which we have now schedule for November 8. 
I'll now share with you our combined company non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter and provide some context that we consider important. Shipments of $950 million, plus or minus, $30 million, revenues of $900 million, plus or minus, $30 million, gross margin at 42.5% plus or minus 1%, operating profit at 10% plus or minus 1.5% and earnings per share of $0.40 plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of 183 million shares. Worthy of note, the revenue recognition changes that Ernie discussed for Novellus products will also impact our financial statements in the September quarter. 
The September quarter guidance I just provided would be improved by the following amounts where it not for the revenue recognition changes. Approximately $100 million of revenue, approximately 1 percentage point of gross margin and approximately $0.25 of earnings per share. 
I would like to reemphasize Lam's commitment on a standalone basis to maintain quarterly operating expenses at or below the $200 million level through the remainder of calendar year 2012, and we would expect overall OpEx levels to remain fairly flat in the December quarter from the level implied by our September guidance today. 
In closing, I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to the leadership and broad employee population of the combined company who have worked tirelessly to support our stated goals and achievements and thank all of our stakeholders for their continued patience and support to our company through this period of significant transition. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

If you look at our guidance, so embedded in the $950 million of shipments guidance, obviously, the primary component of that relates to our systems and the foundry component approximately is in the high 40s, maybe 47% plus or minus a bit, and memory component is about 43% of the shipments guidance, again plus or minus points, and the logic represents the remaining 10%. And within that memory, 43%, the NAND shipments actually are a little stronger in absolute dollars than the DRAM shipments. So that's kind of the context I guess for answering this specific question. Certainly, we've messaged exactly as you hypothesized in your question. The primary change for us against our original assumptions is in NAND and not in Foundry. There's a little bit of movement, but it's not a material enough for me to kind of add to what we have previously stated. You are going to -- you have to ask your question again on the NAND piece on the end. I missed it."

We had anticipated that calendar 2012, from a shipment's perspective, would be reasonably flat, plus or minus a little bit. And clearly, in light of messaging today, that's our wafer fabrication equipment spending outlook for the year. It's at the low end of the range, we would now slightly modify the first half, second half commentary and say that the first half, we believe, is slightly stronger than the second half and I would, of course, in percentages I would put the first half in the low 50s and the second half the high 40s. So that's how you should think about kind of first half and second half at this point of time and I would say that the ratio I just gave you, the low 50s and the high 40s, first half, second half, WFE, is accentuated a little in the foundries. For December, clearly, there's a lot of moving parts and it would be premature for us to be specific about guidance today. Directionally, I'm thinking that our shipments levels will be flat to slightly up over September, but there is a lot of time ahead of us for that to change.

There are a number of PC messages that frankly can be quite positive, and the 22-nanometer production is kind of ramping and the 40-nanometer [ph] start by the end of the year, kind of ramping to next year and we see that typically as a transition that would drive WFE in the microprocessor space."

It's not a feature-creating investment for the customer. And so even in a scenario where you didn't synchronize necessarily a new product to a PTY decision or a first phase PTY decision, Clean is one of the segments where if you can demonstrate value to the customer in terms of yield solutions in excess of a previously selected equipment set, then you have a much better chance of establishing co-PTY positions and ultimately displacing a competition and the bias.

Everything that we've been able to kind of analyze would cause us to conclude what we're concluding relative to the 300,000 wafer starts message for 28-nanometer. I think at least one other equipment company has messaged something very similar recently. And I think the foundry public announcement have tended to talk about 28-nanometer spending in '13 and the 20 beginning to production ramp in '13, but primarily in '14. So it kind of hangs together. It's the best we can tell. That all being said, clearly, every semiconductor company in the world is motivated to achieve the lowest-cost unit output, and if a 20-nanometer solution achieves that, that may be their motivation. But again, I'd put that in context of the WFE message that I shared in an earlier question. The cost consequence of 10,000 wafer start addition of 20 nanometers is in the range of 30% to 40% more expensive than 28. So it's not an easy trade-off.

But I think it's important at this point to understand that those estimates are now many, many months old and what will become relevant which we'll be sharing here in the November timeframe will be our view for 2013. That's going to be derived in a timeframe that is much more relevant to the actuality of '13 than existed at the time we put the proxy together."

The June quarter marks an important milestone in the history of Lam Research. As you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are",1273,"Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. The June quarter marks an important milestone in the history of Lam Research. As you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are reflected in the press release issued earlier today, include only 20 days of Novellus activity. With that in mind, I'd like to begin my remarks today by reviewing Lam's standalone performance for the June quarter as it relates to the guidance we've provided on our April call. 
We ended our fiscal year with solid performance and exceeded the midpoints of our guidance range for all metrics provided. Specifically, shipments were approximately $727 million for the quarter, up 2% from the March quarter, supported by capacity additions for leading etch Foundry customers and DRAM capacity conversions for the 2x and 3x technology nodes. Although moderating, leading edge NAND capacity additions continue to be a meaningful part of the company's shipment profile. 
Turning to the breakdown by application and market segment for Lam's standalone shipments, applications for sub 4x technology nodes represented 96% of overall system shipments. Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments while the Memory segment accounted for 46% total shipments divided between NAND at 18% and DRAM at 28%. Lastly, Logic and Other constituted the balance of 6%. 
Revenue in the June quarter was $716 million, up 9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41.9%, up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $195 million versus $197 million in the March quarter. The operating expense level reflects our continued investment in the strategic products and projects offset by favorability related to deferred compensation plan obligations resulting from stock market decline. Lam attempts to mitigate overall plan exposure relative to market fluctuations and the decreased operating expenses were substantively offset in other income and expense. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $106 million versus $73 million in the prior quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 14.7%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on a positive progression from the 11.1% in the March 2012 quarter. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was aligned with our expectations at 16.5% compared to the 20.4% for the March quarter. Based on a share count of approximately 117 million shares, June quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.75, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.03. I'll note once again that all of the data I've just provided is for Lam's standalone and is intended to be compared to our previously provided June quarter guidance. 
Prior to presenting the balance sheet for the combined company, I'd like to address a few housekeeping items. First, as we think about fiscal year 2013, as the new Lam, we currently contemplate a tax rate in the midteens. This estimate is subject to further revision as we more thoroughly complete tax planning activities for the combined company and would be favorably impacted should the Federal R&D tax credit be extended. Relative to Novellus on a standalone basis, shipments for the June quarter were approximately $309 million while the combined company recorded it $816 million in shipments for the same period, which includes $89 million of Novellus shipments made after June 4. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. The results that follow represent the combined company. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments of $3 billion versus $2.6 billion for Lam's standalone in the prior quarter. This includes approximately $1.1 billion acquired as a result of the Novellus transaction, offset by the impact of our June quarter share repurchase activity, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Relative to DSO and inventory turns while there has been no significant change to the underlying operational performance of either company, June quarter financial results are significantly impacted by the 20 day stop period for Novellus and are not helpful for understanding the companies' overall performance. We foresee a return to more normal external metrics in the September quarter and we will discuss them at that time. 
We ended the June quarter with deferred revenue of $335 million excluding approximately $23 million in shipments to Japanese customers that were revenue in future quarters. Approximately $87 million of the deferred revenue balance relates to Novellus products. Combined company non-cash expenses include, among other items, $29 million for equity compensation and $35 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $37 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees, including approximately 2,750 Novellus employees. 
During the June quarter, we spent approximately $676 million for share repurchases and took delivery of approximately 16 million shares of common stock. In the September quarter, we expect to receive an additional 2 to 3 million shares associated with our June quarter expenditures resulting in an effective purchase price between $36 and $38 per share. These deliveries will be in addition to any new September quarter repurchases made under the company's ongoing repurchase program. 
Before turning over the call to Martin, I'd like to discuss the impact of purchase price accounting rules related to the Novellus transaction. In particular, I'd like to call your attention to 3 areas where you will see the largest impact to our results. I'll explain more about the June quarter impact in a few minutes, which in turn provides the baseline for the September quarter guidance that Martin will be discussing in a few minutes. 
First, the transaction required that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities be recorded at current fair value including the inventory acquired from Novellus. This includes finished goods, work in process and raw materials and for the next 2 to 3 quarters, we will have revenue recognized with cost of goods sold values that are higher than the Novellus historical cost. These differences will be noted as a non-GAAP adjustment.
The second area that was impacted by the transaction was revenue. Because Novellus and Lam had differing revenue recognition policies, there will be a delay in recognizing revenue for some Novellus Systems as we transition to Lam's customer acceptance based model. Additionally, due to purchase price accounting rules, we will not be able to recognize the majority of Novellus' deferred revenue that was recorded on its balance sheet as of the day of the transaction close, since the tools had already been physically delivered to customers. This Novellus deferred revenue totaled approximately $37 million. 
We expect that these timing differences will be fully normalized within a 2 to 3 quarter period and until then, we'll provide an estimate of their impacts. The circumstances in no way impact the timing or collectibility of any customer receivables. Finally, our non-GAAP results will now also exclude the amortization of intangible assets we acquired and valued as of the date of the acquisition. 
I'd also like to call your attention to the fact that our GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense will now include the expense associated with the coupon interest of the convertible debt we acquired as part of the transaction, currently estimated at approximately $4.5 million per quarter. As has been the case, our non-GAAP results will continue to exclude acquisition and integration related costs, the amortization of discounts for both companies' convertible notes and other certain nonrecurring items. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for a complete review of the exclusion. With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."
30655,213576934,331121,"Lam Research Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immed",1905,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immediately began executing on the objectives we established for the combined company while at the same time, ensuring continued focus on commitments made to our customers as 2 previously standalone companies. 
Before I expand on our progress internally, I'd first like to share our views on the current business environment. Since our April call, optimism around macroeconomic strength has waned somewhat and while views for 2012 GDP remain in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, estimates for 2013 growth appear to have weakened to below 3%, a level that is now more consistent with a stable growth outlook year-over-year with potential, we believe, for electronics growth in 2013 in excess of 2012. 
It is premature to start predicting 2013 wafer fabrication equipment spending with any certainty clearly. But our initial modeling of IC unit supply and demand would cause us to anticipate that spend would remain around the $30 billion level for a fourth straight year. Continued concerns over the Europe debt crisis, unemployment in the U.S. and questions about the level of China's growth outlook, all have the potential to constrain or negatively impact consumer electronics demand. We expect our customers to continue to focus on aligning their capacity additions with their own view of that demand outlook. One reasonable conclusion is that our near-term future is quite unsettled due to these macro factors. As such, we would now expect 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending to be at the low end of our previously communicated $30 billion to $32 billion range. 
Turning first to the Foundry segments. We continue to expect Foundry WFE spending within a range of $12 billion to $13 billion, driven primarily by demand for leading edge capacity. Specifically, we are still projecting approximately 90,000 wafer starts per month of new 32, 28-nanometer capacity will be added throughout 2012, which supports our prior view for exiting the year with between 220,000 and 240,000 wafer starts per month of 32/28nm capacity. Given what appears to be a healthy demand for devices manufactured at this technology node, we continue to expect more than 300,000 wafer starts of total capacity to be ultimately installed, a figure that will surpass all prior year Foundry nodes. 
Investment timing will depend on several factors including economic uncertainty, competitive dynamics and production performance of our customers. However, our view suggests plenty of runway remains for 28-nanometer Foundry spending. Relative to the Logic markets, the leading edge 22-nanometer production ramp continues. Our outlook for WFE spend in the segment has marginally declined as opportunities for reuse of existing equipment appeared to have increased and the proportion of total CapEx for shelf space is now greater than previously expected. Likely, this bodes well for equipment spending in 2013.
Our view of the DRAM segments has not substantially changed. We continue to see muted investment level supporting the big growth in the low 30% range this year. With virtually no new plant capacity additions in 2012, there remains the potential for supply constraints exiting 2012. Additionally, the sustained economic pressures caused by the proximity of DRAM selling prices to manufacturing costs motivate customers to convert capacity to the most competitive leading edge capability. While this scenario could result in higher levels of DRAM spending in 2013, spending levels will largely be a function of the demand environments. Again, the macros are likely to dominate. 
Finally, looking at the NAND segments. We have lowered our second half WFE spend forecast as a couple of customers appear to have delayed their investment plans slightly from the second half of 2012 into early 2013. We have projected NAND's WFE spend to decline by approximately $1 billion year-on-year and to date our figure is likely closer to $2 billion. While our 2012 forecast for NAND's demand drivers such as smartphones and tablet devices have remain healthy, the amount of NAND's capacity in place today we believe can meet the consensus big growth estimates of approximately 65% this year. 
The pricing environment can certainly influence investment decisions. NAND's pricing progressively worsened throughout the quarter, although we started to see pricing stabilize. The implications of that are not yet completely clear. 
To summarize, despite today's muted macroeconomic environments, our 2012 WFE spend forecast in the $30 billion range is close to historic peak levels. The outlook for sustains 28-nanometer Foundry investment looks good through 2013, the drivers for Lam's capacity additions look good in the long-term, but as stated, we're seeing some timing adjustments recently slowing investments. The DRAM and the microprocessor world both share PC as a primary underlying demand driver and we consider it more likely than not, there is positive unit momentum here in 2013.
Taken together, we remain cautiously optimistic about IC unit demands next year, but acknowledge the uncertainty of our global economy and share the common interests to see these macro questions get answered in the coming months. 
Turning now to Lam's business performance. While relatively few new application decisions were made by our customers in the first half of this year, we made positive progress towards a number of targeted growth applications while successfully defending critical positions in etch, single-wafer clean and NAND deposition. 
To capture a few headlines. In PECVD, we gained a few critical back-end Logic applications by demonstrating minimal low key film damage combined with repeated [ph]  Process results at high productivity. Combined with our strong position in conductor etch patenting steps, we are well-positioned for the Foundry transition to 20 nanometer. Our engagements with leading NAND manufacturers position us well for opportunities resulting from the 3D devices broadly. In dielectric etch, we gained momentum for high aspect ratio etches, considered one of the most challenging etch processes. We have demonstrated the ability to provide tight CD and profile performance without compromising productivity. As a result of these capabilities, we are able to strengthen our position in memory applications and are well-positioned for next generation DRAM decisions and 3D NAND applications. 
In deposition, the need to fill these very high aspect ratio features without voids has become increasingly critical to device performance. We believe we are well-positioned to extend our leadership in tungsten CVD with our differentiated extreme FEOL technology which delivers a seam-free FEOL using low resistivity tungsten. Similarly, in PECVD, our ability to deposit multiple layers of ultrasmooth film stacks as high productivity has resulted in multiple customer engagements for 3D NAND device developments. 
Finally, in single wafer clean, we continue our next-generation product development efforts which are well underway. These systems combined our different CD drying and chemical retain technologies with targeted newly developed technical and productivity capabilities that will position us to better compete across a more comprehensive set of single wafer clean applications. 
As stated before, given the current wafer fab environment, the mix and timing of customer equipment selections and spending, we expect shipped market share will be relatively be neutral for etch deposition and single wafer clean this year. The headlines I've just described reflect our continued focus on our longer-term growth objectives for gaining 3 to 5 percentage points in etch, 5 to 10 percentage points in single wafer clean, and now, 4 to 8 percentage points in deposition over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Overall, we're pleased to report again that reflecting back on the first half of the year, the Lam and Novellus continue to execute to each company's established business plans and records, also engaging fully in integration planning and activities associated with closing the transaction. We achieved our objective to transition on day 1 without disruptions to our customers, suppliers or employees, which we consider our highest priority. 
With the merger now complete, we are focused on competing as one company on its successful integration and executing the comprehensive plans targeted to achieve accelerated growth and profitability. Our priorities must always include building customer trust, partnership and collaboration without which, our plans are less probable and targeted results, we believe, less sustainable. 
We began implementing plans to realize cost synergies immediately, starting with areas where we had identified duplicative resources and services. Although not the primary definition of success for this transaction, we are already spending less money together than we would have done separately. We are on plan and are pleased with the pace of our progress thus far. In the coming quarters, we will share more specifics relative to our performance against target savings of $100 million on an annualized basis exiting 2013. 
Our cost reduction synergies are anticipated to deliver benefits each and every quarter this year and next. They are not linear in their impacts, however, and specifically in the middle of next calendar year, they include a step-function reduction of costs related to business process and systems streamlining. We are executing plans to integrate key business processes, management systems and infrastructure which we target to be largely completed within the next 12 months. Especially important is our focus on employees during a period of transition of this scale. Together, our focus has been rewarded by successes in our efforts to retain key employees as we move through the integration process. 
Lastly, subsequent to reaching the June 4, 2012, acquisition closing, we were finally able to begin our efforts in earnest to engage with customers on a broad set of opportunities uniquely created by this merging to accelerate their success and ours. As we spend more time meeting jointly with our customers, our confidence in achieving our growth objectives for the combined company has grown higher. We look forward to sharing further details on our plans to achieve substantive revenue synergies over the coming years during our upcoming analyst event which we've now scheduled for November 8. 
I'll now share with you our combined company non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter and provide some context that we consider important. Shipments of $950 million, plus or minus, $30 million, revenues of $900 million, plus or minus, $30 million, gross margin at 42.5% plus or minus 1%, operating profit at 10% plus or minus 1.5% and earnings per share of $0.40 plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of 183 million shares. Worthy of note, the revenue recognition changes that Ernie discussed for Novellus products will also impact our financial statements in the September quarter. 
The September quarter guidance I just provided would be improved by the following amounts where it not for the revenue recognition changes. Approximately $100 million of revenue, approximately 1 percentage point of gross margin and approximately $0.25 of earnings per share. 
I would like to reemphasize Lam's commitment on a standalone basis to maintain quarterly operating expenses at or below the $200 million level through the remainder of calendar year 2012, and we would expect overall OpEx levels to remain fairly flat in the December quarter from the level implied by our September guidance today. 
In closing, I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to the leadership and broad employee population of the combined company who have worked tirelessly to support our stated goals and achievements and thank all of our stakeholders for their continued patience and support to our company through this period of significant transition. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

I would say, if there's ever a segment of our business of our company where the risk profile is lowest is being Clean and the reason and that's true is because Clean is a yield-enhancing investment by the customer. It's not a feature-creating investment for the customer. And so even in a scenario where you didn't synchronize necessarily a new product to a DTOR decision or a first phase PTOR decision, Clean is one of the segments where if you can demonstrate value to the customer in terms of yield solutions in excess of a previously selected equipment set, then you have a much better chance of establishing co-PTOR positions and ultimately displacing a competition in a buy. If there's ever a place in the business where you feel better around the risk you've just spoken to, Clean is definitely the second."

The biggest influence is the design decisions of the customers, of the foundries. Everything that we've been able to kind of analyze would cause us to conclude what we're concluding relative to the 300,000 wafer starts message for 28-nanometer. I think at least one other equipment company has messaged something very similar recently. And I think the foundry public announcements have tended to talk about 28-nanometer spending in '13 and the 20-nanometer beginning to production ramp in '13, but primarily in '14. So it kind of hangs together as best we can tell. That all being said, clearly, every semiconductor company in the world is motivated to achieve lowest-cost unit output, and if a 20-nanometer solution achieves that, that may be their motivation. But again, I'd put that in context of the WFE message that I shared in an earlier question. The cost consequence of 10,000 wafer start addition of 20 nanometers is in the range of 30% to 40% more expensive than 28. So it's not an easy trade-off. I mean, it's definitely stressing what has been a fairly kind of simple set of decisions historically."

The June quarter marks an important milestone in the history of Lam Research. As you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are",1273,"Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. The June quarter marks an important milestone in the history of Lam Research. As you know on June 4, we successfully completed the acquisition of Novellus Systems. Our combined financial results, which are reflected in the press release issued earlier today, include only 20 days of Novellus activity. With that in mind, I'd like to begin my remarks today by reviewing Lam's standalone performance for the June quarter as it relates to the guidance we've provided on our April call. 
We ended our fiscal year with solid performance and exceeded the midpoints of our guidance range for all metrics provided. Specifically, shipments were approximately $727 million for the quarter, up 2% from the March quarter, supported by capacity additions for leading etch Foundry customers and DRAM capacity conversions for the 2x and 3x technology nodes. Although moderating, leading edge NAND capacity additions continue to be a meaningful part of the company's shipment profile. 
Turning to the breakdown by application and market segment for Lam's standalone shipments, applications for sub 4x technology nodes represented 96% of overall system shipments. Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments while the Memory segment accounted for 46% total shipments divided between NAND at 18% and DRAM at 28%. Lastly, Logic and Other constituted the balance of 6%. 
Revenue in the June quarter was $716 million, up 9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41.9%, up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $195 million versus $197 million in the March quarter. The operating expense level reflects our continued investment in the strategic products and projects offset by favorability related to deferred compensation plan obligations resulting from stock market decline. Lam attempts to mitigate overall plan exposure relative to market fluctuations and the decreased operating expenses were substantively offset in other income and expense. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $106 million versus $73 million in the prior quarter and resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 14.7%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on a positive progression from the 11.1% in the March 2012 quarter. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was aligned with our expectations at 16.5% compared to the 20.4% for the March quarter. Based on a share count of approximately 117 million shares, June quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.75, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the quarter by $0.03. I'll note once again that all of the data I've just provided is for Lam's standalone and is intended to be compared to our previously provided June quarter guidance. 
Prior to presenting the balance sheet for the combined company, I'd like to address a few housekeeping items. First, as we think about fiscal year 2013, as the new Lam, we currently contemplate a tax rate in the midteens. This estimate is subject to further revision as we more thoroughly complete tax planning activities for the combined company and would be favorably impacted should the Federal R&D tax credit be extended. Relative to Novellus on a standalone basis, shipments for the June quarter were approximately $309 million while the combined company recorded it $816 million in shipments for the same period, which includes $89 million of Novellus shipments made after June 4. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. The results that follow represent the combined company. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash and investments of $3 billion versus $2.6 billion for Lam's standalone in the prior quarter. This includes approximately $1.1 billion acquired as a result of the Novellus transaction, offset by the impact of our June quarter share repurchase activity, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Relative to DSO and inventory turns while there has been no significant change to the underlying operational performance of either company, June quarter financial results are significantly impacted by the 20 day stop period for Novellus and are not helpful for understanding the companies' overall performance. We foresee a return to more normal external metrics in the September quarter and we will discuss them at that time. 
We ended the June quarter with deferred revenue of $335 million excluding approximately $23 million in shipments to Japanese customers that were revenue in future quarters. Approximately $87 million of the deferred revenue balance relates to Novellus products. Combined company non-cash expenses include, among other items, $29 million for equity compensation and $35 million for depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures were $37 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees, including approximately 2,750 Novellus employees. 
During the June quarter, we spent approximately $676 million for share repurchases and took delivery of approximately 16 million shares of common stock. In the September quarter, we expect to receive an additional 2 to 3 million shares associated with our June quarter expenditures resulting in an effective purchase price between $36 and $38 per share. These deliveries will be in addition to any new September quarter repurchases made under the company's ongoing repurchase program. 
Before turning over the call to Martin, I'd like to discuss the impact of purchase price accounting rules related to the Novellus transaction. In particular, I'd like to call your attention to 3 areas where you will see the largest impact to our results. I'll explain more about the June quarter impact in a few minutes, which in turn provides the baseline for the September quarter guidance that Martin will be discussing in a few minutes. 
First, the transaction required that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities be recorded at current fair value including the inventory acquired from Novellus. This includes finished goods, work in process and raw materials and for the next 2 to 3 quarters, we will have revenue recognized with cost of goods sold values that are higher than the Novellus historical cost. These differences will be noted as a non-GAAP adjustment.
The second area that was impacted by the transaction was revenue. Because Novellus and Lam had differing revenue recognition policies, there will be a delay in recognizing revenue for some Novellus Systems as we transition to Lam's customer acceptance based model. Additionally, due to purchase price accounting rules, we will not be able to recognize the majority of Novellus' deferred revenue that was recorded on its balance sheet as of the day of the transaction close, since the tools had already been physically delivered to customers. This Novellus deferred revenue totaled approximately $37 million. 
We expect that these timing differences will be fully normalized within a 2 to 3 quarter period and until then, we'll provide an estimate of their impacts. The circumstances in no way impact the timing or collectability of any customer receivables. Finally, our non-GAAP results will now also exclude the amortization of intangible assets we acquired and valued as of the date of the acquisition. 
I'd also like to call your attention to the fact that our GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense will now include the expense associated with the coupon interest of the convertible debt we acquired as part of the transaction, currently estimated at approximately $4.5 million per quarter. As has been the case, our non-GAAP results will continue to exclude acquisition and integration related costs, the amortization of discounts for both companies' convertible notes and other certain nonrecurring items. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for a complete review of the exclusion. With that, I'll now turn it over to Martin for his comments."

Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immed",1905,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam's June quarter was very successful and I continue to be encouraged by the company's achievements. In addition to delivering targeted financial performance, we closed our acquisition of Novellus and immediately began executing on the objectives we established for the combined company while at the same time, ensuring continued focus on commitments made to our customers as 2 previously standalone companies. 
Before I expand on our progress internally, I'd first like to share our views on the current business environment. Since our April call, optimism around macroeconomic strength has waned somewhat and while views for 2012 GDP remain in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, estimates for 2013 growth appear to have weakened to below 3%, a level that is now more consistent with a stable growth outlook year-over-year with potential, we believe, for electronics growth in 2013 in excess of 2012. 
It is premature to start predicting 2013 wafer fabrication equipment spending with any certainty clearly. But our initial modeling of IC unit supply and demand would cause us to anticipate that spend would remain around the $30 billion level for a fourth straight year. Continued concerns over the Europe debt crisis, unemployment in the U.S. and questions about the level of China's growth outlook, all have the potential to constrain or negatively impact consumer electronics demand. We expect our customers to continue to focus on aligning their capacity additions with their own view of that demand outlook. One reasonable conclusion is that our near-term future is quite unsettled due to these macro factors. As such, we would now expect 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending to be at the low end of our previously communicated $30 billion to $32 billion range. 
Turning first to the Foundry segments. We continue to expect Foundry WFE spending within a range of $12 billion to $13 billion, driven primarily by demand for leading edge capacity. Specifically, we are still projecting approximately 90,000 wafer starts per month of new 32, 28-nanometer capacity will be added throughout 2012, which supports our prior view for exiting the year with between 220,000 and 240,000 wafer starts per month of 32/28nm capacity. Given what appears to be a healthy demand for devices manufactured at this technology node, we continue to expect more than 300,000 wafer starts of total capacity to be ultimately installed, a figure that will surpass all prior year Foundry nodes. 
Investment timing will depend on several factors including economic uncertainty, competitive dynamics and production performance of our customers. However, our view suggests plenty of runway remains for 28-nanometer Foundry spending. Relative to the Logic markets, the leading edge 22-nanometer production ramp continues. Our outlook for WFE spend in the segment has marginally declined as opportunities for reuse of existing equipment appeared to have increased and the proportion of total CapEx for shelf space is now greater than previously expected. Likely, this bodes well for equipment spending in 2013.
Our view of the DRAM segments has not substantially changed. We continue to see muted investment level supporting the big growth in the low 30% range this year. With virtually no new plant capacity additions in 2012, there remains the potential for supply constraints exiting 2012. Additionally, the sustained economic pressures caused by the proximity of DRAM selling prices to manufacturing costs motivate customers to convert capacity to the most competitive leading edge capability. While this scenario could result in higher levels of DRAM spending in 2013, spending levels will largely be a function of the demand environments. Again, the macros are likely to dominate. 
Finally, looking at the NAND segments. We have lowered our second half WFE spend forecast as a couple of customers appear to have delayed their investment plans slightly from the second half of 2012 into early 2013. We have projected NAND's WFE spend to decline by approximately $1 billion year-on-year and to date our figure is likely closer to $2 billion. While our 2012 forecast for NAND's demand drivers such as smartphones and tablet devices have remain healthy, the amount of NAND's capacity in place today we believe can meet the consensus big growth estimates of approximately 65% this year. 
The pricing environment can certainly influence investment decisions. NAND's pricing progressively worsened throughout the quarter, although we started to see pricing stabilize. The implications of that are not yet completely clear. 
To summarize, despite today's muted macroeconomic environments, our 2012 WFE spend forecast in the $30 billion range is close to historic peak levels. The outlook for sustains 28-nanometer Foundry investment looks good through 2013, the drivers for Lam's capacity additions look good in the long-term, but as stated, we're seeing some timing adjustments recently slowing investments. The DRAM and the microprocessor world both share PC as a primary underlying demand driver and we consider it more likely than not, there is positive unit momentum here in 2013.
Taken together, we remain cautiously optimistic about IC unit demands next year, but acknowledge the uncertainty of our global economy and share the common interests to see these macro questions get answered in the coming months. 
Turning now to Lam's business performance. While relatively few new application decisions were made by our customers in the first half of this year, we made positive progress towards a number of targeted growth applications while successfully defending critical positions in etch, single-wafer clean and NAND deposition. 
To capture a few headlines. In PECVD, we gained a few critical back-end Logic applications by demonstrating minimal low key film damage combined with repeated [ph] Process results at high productivity. Combined with our strong position in conductor etch patenting steps, we are well-positioned for the Foundry transition to 20 nanometer. Our engagements with leading NAND manufacturers position us well for opportunities resulting from the 3D devices broadly. In dielectric etch, we gained momentum for high aspect ratio etches, considered one of the most challenging etch processes. We have demonstrated the ability to provide tight CD and profile performance without compromising productivity. As a result of these capabilities, we are able to strengthen our position in memory applications and are well-positioned for next generation DRAM decisions and 3D NAND applications. 
In deposition, the need to fill these very high aspect ratio features without voids has become increasingly critical to device performance. We believe we are well-positioned to extend our leadership in tungsten CVD with our differentiated extreme FEOL technology which delivers a seam-free FEOL using low resistivity tungsten. Similarly, in PECVD, our ability to deposit multiple layers of ultrasmooth film stacks as high productivity has resulted in multiple customer engagements for 3D NAND device developments. 
Finally, in single wafer clean, we continue our next-generation product development efforts which are well underway. These systems combined our different CD drying and chemical retain technologies with targeted newly developed technical and productivity capabilities that will position us to better compete across a more comprehensive set of single wafer clean applications. 
As stated before, given the current wafer fab environment, the mix and timing of customer equipment selections and spending, we expect shipped market share will be relatively be neutral for etch deposition and single wafer clean this year. The headlines I've just described reflect our continued focus on our longer-term growth objectives for gaining 3 to 5 percentage points in etch, 5 to 10 percentage points in single wafer clean, and now, 4 to 8 percentage points in deposition over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Overall, we're pleased to report again that reflecting back on the first half of the year, the Lam and Novellus continue to execute to each company's established business plans and records, also engaging fully in integration planning and activities associated with closing the transaction. We achieved our objective to transition on day 1 without disruptions to our customers, suppliers or employees, which we consider our highest priority. 
With the merger now complete, we are focused on competing as one company on its successful integration and executing the comprehensive plans targeted to achieve accelerated growth and profitability. Our priorities must always include building customer trust, partnership and collaboration without which, our plans are less probable and targeted results, we believe, less sustainable. 
We began implementing plans to realize cost synergies immediately, starting with areas where we had identified duplicative resources and services. Although not the primary definition of success for this transaction, we are already spending less money together than we would have done separately. We are on plan and are pleased with the pace of our progress thus far. In the coming quarters, we will share more specifics relative to our performance against target savings of $100 million on an annualized basis exiting 2013. 
Our cost reduction synergies are anticipated to deliver benefits each and every quarter this year and next. They are not linear in their impacts, however, and specifically in the middle of next calendar year, they include a step-function reduction of costs related to business process and systems streamlining. We are executing plans to integrate key business processes, management systems and infrastructure which we target to be largely completed within the next 12 months. Especially important is our focus on employees during a period of transition of this scale. Together, our focus has been rewarded by successes in our efforts to retain key employees as we move through the integration process. 
Lastly, subsequent to reaching the June 4, 2012, acquisition closing, we were finally able to begin our efforts in earnest to engage with customers on a broad set of opportunities uniquely created by this merging to accelerate their success and ours. As we spend more time meeting jointly with our customers, our confidence in achieving our growth objectives for the combined company has grown higher. We look forward to sharing further details on our plans to achieve substantive revenue synergies over the coming years during our upcoming analyst event which we've now scheduled for November 8. 
I'll now share with you our combined company non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter and provide some context that we consider important. Shipments of $950 million, plus or minus, $30 million, revenues of $900 million, plus or minus, $30 million, gross margin at 42.5% plus or minus 1%, operating profit at 10% plus or minus 1.5% and earnings per share of $0.40 plus or minus $0.07, based on a share count of 183 million shares. Worthy of note, the revenue recognition changes that Ernie discussed for Novellus products will also impact our financial statements in the September quarter. 
The September quarter guidance I just provided would be improved by the following amounts where it not for the revenue recognition changes. Approximately $100 million of revenue, approximately 1 percentage point of gross margin and approximately $0.25 of earnings per share. 
I would like to reemphasize Lam's commitment on a standalone basis to maintain quarterly operating expenses at or below the $200 million level through the remainder of calendar year 2012, and we would expect overall OpEx levels to remain fairly flat in the December quarter from the level implied by our September guidance today. 
In closing, I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to the leadership and broad employee population of the combined company who have worked tirelessly to support our stated goals and achievements and thank all of our stakeholders for their continued patience and support to our company through this period of significant transition. 
With that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

It's certainly, meaningly, meaningfully more expensive. And frankly, I would use the kind of traditional 13% of wafer fab estimate for etch as a vehicle for kind of backing into the etch specific answer to your question. There clearly is in the 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer Foundry transition some pretty meaningful process flow related changes for high key metal gates and also, in the area of multiple patenting that I think are net positive to the etch segments and we're positioned to exploit that opportunity when it presents itself."

If you look at our guidance, so embedded in the $950 million of shipments guidance, obviously, the primary component of that relates to our systems and the foundry component approximately is in the high 40s, maybe 47% plus or minus a bit, and memory component is about 43% of the shipments guidance, again plus or minus points, and the logic represents the remaining 10%. And within that memory, 43%, the NAND shipments actually are a little stronger in absolute dollars than the DRAM shipments. So that's kind of the context I guess for answering this specific question. Certainly, we've messaged exactly as you hypothesized in your question. The primary change for us against our original assumptions is in NAND and not in Foundry. There's a little bit of movement, but it's not a material enough for me to kind of add to what we have previously stated.

It's at the low end of the range, we would now slightly modify the first half, second half commentary and say that the first half, we believe, is slightly stronger than the second half and I would, of course, in percentages I would put the first half in the low 50s and the second half the high 40s. So that's how you should think about kind of first half and second half at this point of time and I would say that the ratio I just gave you, the low 50s and the high 40s, first half, second half, WFE, is accentuated a little in the foundries.

Everything that we've been able to kind of analyze would cause us to conclude what we're concluding relative to the 300,000 wafer starts message for 28-nanometer. I think at least one other equipment company has messaged something very similar recently. And I think the foundry public announcements have tended to talk about 28-nanometer spending in '13 and the 20-nanometer beginning to production ramp in '13, but primarily in '14. So it kind of hangs together as best we can tell. That all being said, clearly, every semiconductor company in the world is motivated to achieve lowest-cost unit output, and if a 20-nanometer solution achieves that, that may be their motivation. But again, I'd put that in context of the WFE message that I shared in an earlier question. The cost consequence of 10,000 wafer start addition of 20 nanometers is in the range of 30% to 40% more expensive than 28. So it's not an easy trade-off.

The challenge is, how are everybody else's process times changing and while we have a really good knowledge about our business, we don't really have good knowledge about everybody else's business, number one. Number two, the ultimate consequence of all of this is defined on an income statement and what shows up on an income statement isn't process time, what shows up on an income statement is the sum of the invoices that you get paid by customers for, and so relative pricing roadmaps of customers and how that ultimately plays out is important. And so very, very simple message. We are very convicted about delivering a message that there's some positives in segments that we will benefit from in these transitions. And it's our job to make sure that we position that value very well at the customer and then we get paid for it fairly and then just kind of what that turned out to be and how it plays out as a function about what we do, what our customers do and those of our peer group as well, complicated math."

The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over wire services shortly after 1 p.m. this afternoon and is also available on our website at lamresearch.com.
Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements including those related to our expectations for the global macroeconomic environment, market size; wafer fab equipment spending; the revenue from shipments to Japanese customers; market share changes; consumer demand, customer spending and behavior and the factors that will influence those expectations as well as our spending projections; our investment plans; our business strategies; our aspirations of the benefits with our merger with Novellus; our intentions for research and development activities, our contemplated tax rate and our forecast of market shares, shipments, revenues, expenses, margins operating profits, share repurchase activities, earnings per share and cash generation on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as other statements of the company's expectations, beliefs and plans.
There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements, and a list of those factors can be found in the slide package accompanying this conference call and on our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All forward-looking statements are based on current information, and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. and we ask that you please limit questions to 1 per firm with a brief follow-up.

30655,217781502,365986,"Lam Research Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report good results for the quarter ended September 23. All metrics mentioned on today's call are for the combined company. And as a reminder, the September quarter results include a full qua",757,"Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report good results for the quarter ended September 23. All metrics mentioned on today's call are for the combined company. And as a reminder, the September quarter results include a full quarter of merger-related activity, while any June quarter comparisons reflect only 20 days work.
Total shipments were $935 million for the September quarter, up 15% from the June quarter and within our previously guided range. As expected, we did see a slight broadening of customers across multiple segments, and to that point for the September quarter, approximately 20% of our system shipments were for technology nodes greater than 4X, while the remainder of approximately 80% were for applications at the sub 4X technology node.
Segment data is as follows: Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments while the memory segment accounted for 42% of total system shipments, which include NAND at 22%; DRAM at 19%; and other memory at 1%. Constituting the balance, logic and other were 10% of total system shipments. 
Revenue in the September quarter was $907 million, up 22% sequentially and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.4%, up 2.3 percentage points from the prior quarter and exceeding the high-end of our guidance range, primarily due to solid operational execution and more favorable product and customer mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $284 million, up sequentially from $215 million in June. A more instructional comparison would be the performance of the 2 companies on a stand-alone basis during the March quarter where combined expenses totaled $293 million.
Between $5 million and $6 million of the reduction relates to the achievement of OpEx related synergies, while the remainder relates to lower stock compensation expense associated with merger-related acceleration of equity awards.
The combination of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP operating income of $118 million and non-GAAP operating margin of 13% exceeding the high end of our guidance range. 
Relative to our expectations for the quarter, non-GAAP other expenses of $2.2 million was favorably impacted by foreign currency adjustments and interest income.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.3% compared to 16.9% in the June quarter, and presently, we're still expecting a fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate in the midteens.
Should the federal R&D tax credit be extended prior to our fiscal year end, this rate would be reduced to the lower teens. Based on the share count of approximately 182 million shares, September quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.53 exceeding the high end of this quarter's guidance by $0.06.
Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments of $2.9 billion versus $3 billion in the prior quarter, with our cash generation for the quarter being offset by our ongoing share repurchase program. Day sales outstanding for the September quarter were 64, and inventory turns were 4.0.
As you know, we did not report these metrics for the June quarter as the 20 days sub period related to the Novellus transaction caused these metrics to be unhelpful.
During the September quarter, these metrics for the combined company are aligned with normalized levels. And for comparison, DSO for the March quarter for Lam's standalone were 65 days and the inventory turns were 4.2. We ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $364 million, excluding approximately $21 million in the shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters.
Cash from operations was $249 million or 27% of revenue in the September quarter, and we currently expect that as a percentage of revenue, CY '13 cash from operations will approximate CY '13 non-GAAP operating income.
Combined company non-cash expense includes among other items, $24 million for equity compensation, $45 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees.
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our ongoing share repurchase activity.
During the September quarter, we spent approximately $344 million repurchasing shares and took delivery of about 12 million shares of common stock, which includes just over 2 million shares received in conjunction with our June quarter expenditures under structured repurchase programs. As indicated previously, our activity during the quarter was more systematic in nature, and we now expect to complete a significant majority of our $1.6 billion share repurchase during 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Martin."
30655,217781502,365986,"Lam Research Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite well-publicized adverse market conditions recently and the associated ongoing cyclical pressures, Lam delivered on all key customer and financial commitments for the September quarter. These achievem",1601,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite well-publicized adverse market conditions recently and the associated ongoing cyclical pressures, Lam delivered on all key customer and financial commitments for the September quarter. These achievements reflect incredible levels of commitment from our employees worldwide, continued focus on operational execution and the unwavering focus on our customers and our strategic growth objectives. We're very pleased with our progress.
First today, I'll briefly update on our views of the industry. Since our last call a number of customers lower their investment plans for the balance of this calendar year. Accordingly, we have further lowered our 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending outlook to a $28 billion to $29 billion range. Having essentially net September guidance, this adjustment impacts the December 2012 quarter significantly, particularly in the area of shipments.
Again, the NAND segment accounted for of as majority of these latest series of spend reductions as manufacturers continue to react to the pricing environments and their view of supply and demand. Given the decreasing new capacity additions plan for the balance of calendar '12, we think it is likely to exit this year with very tight NAND device supply which bodes well for a resurgence of spending in calendar '13, probably in the first half.
Clearly, there is some evidence we are already seeing the impact of dis supply situation in NAND ASPs which has started to increase over this past quarter. This is an important reference point for confidence in future capacity expansion.
While it is still too early to accurately forecast 2013 WFE spend to any significant detail, our initial analysis still supports the prospect for spending once again to be within a range of $30 billion.
Smartphones, tablets and SSDs support the need for new NAND capacity and additional leading-edge foundry and logic investments. These drivers are also positive for mobile DRAM demand. However, projections for PC unit growth and DRAM content growth continued to be modest, resulting in another year of limited DRAM equipment spending most likely.
Considering the fundamentals of WFE capacity and our understanding of demand for electronics products, we could characterize the 2013 WFE spent to have more potential for upside than risk. Needless to say, the often unrelated macro influences independent of the semiconductor cycle are significant to the risk and upside boat.
As you might expect in this environment, Lam is even more focused on executing well, managing short-term volatility but staying the course on the primary elements of our longer-term market share growth objectives. We'll spend more time in our upcoming Analyst Meeting in November, focused on communicating progress to date on these long-term items, characterizing their magnitude and the probability of our excess to our success exploiting market opportunities and technology inflections.
In calendar year 2013, we expect customers to begin ramping capacity additions for the end plus 1 technology node, which includes the transition to 14-nanometer for logic and 20-nanometer for foundry. Potential 3D NANDs private line investments could also begin late in the year, but primarily we are assuming based memory WFE for now. For Lam, these transitions represents key opportunities and support achieving our stated market share growth objectives. We're pleased with our progress.
It goes without saying that successfully defending existing positions is the most critical foundation of market share sustainability. Building off that foundation was targeted application penetrations, to gain share is our proven growth model. In Etch, Clean and deposition, we continue to defend positions well. We believe that approximately 70% of the critical end plus 1 technology node tool selection decisions have been made at this time, and on that basis, we would estimate our application based market share for etch, clean and deposition in the low 50s, low to mid-20s and mid-20s percentage range, respectively.
Especially in etch and deposition, recent selection decisions by our customers have demonstrated good progress towards our goals. In clean, we are now more focused on end plus 2 transitions with the planned release of our next-generation product next year. In the remaining 30% of end plus 1 decisions available and end plus 2 decisions that will be made in earnest throughout next year, we are targeting additional growth finished around key technology inflections consistent with achieving our 3 to 5-year targeted market share growth objectives of plus 3 to 5 percentage points for etch, 5 to 10 percentage points for clean and 4 to 8 percentage points for deposition.
In etch as market share leaders for the conductor segments and particularly for critical patterning processes, Lam stands to benefit from the growing number of patent expense in next-generation foundry and memory devices.
In single wafer clean, we have a position of leadership and back end of line applications and are now focused on delivering enhanced productivity and differentiated process results to better compete for a broad range of applications, including the front end cleans.
Since the last earnings call, our design solutions have generated considerable interest from leading device manufacturers with the promise for delivering a flexible architecture and on-wafer perform capabilities aligned with their roadmaps.
Decisions for clean process steps often come later in the selection process as we talked about previously, and we believe there is the opportunities to capture new applications at the N+1 technology node. And deposition, Lam holds the leading position for critical back end of line interconnect processes, including diffusion barriers, ultralow film gearing and copper sale. The complexity in some cases, the number of layers is increasing, which requires more deposition systems to process the same number of wafers.
As a newly formed combined company, we, Lam and Novellus, are more competitive together, and the timing of our transaction fits well with industry transitions. Illustratively, the 3D NAND devices roadmap represents a significant growth opportunity for both etch and depositions, sometimes together through adjacent process leverage. Repeatable and precise process capabilities are critical to 3D NAND device performance, our ability to etch high aspect ratio structures and deposit a comically smooth firm stacks both uniformly and repeatedly position us well for opportunities in dielectric etch and PE CBD both.
Overall, we're delighted by the interaction and excitement shared among our combined engineering and field organizations more by the results already evidenced to identify and develop strategies for accelerating Lam's growth. Worthy of note, we are already targeting incremental revenues in calendar '13 in excess of our stated synergy cost reductions. We continue to execute plans to combine our key business processes, management systems and infrastructure. The magnitude of these projects is sizable and includes, among other areas, the integration of both company's IT infrastructure, HR platforms and the integration of our ERP systems and processes. We completed a thorough assessment of these projects early on and have developed plans which addressed potential risks. I'm pleased with the pace and progress of our efforts so far, which we are largely targeting to complete by mid-2013 when a number of step function cost synergy actions become possible.
Since closing the Novellus transaction in early June, we've made significant progress against our cost synergy targets. We are rationalizing our infrastructure of the executive level and across our regional management team and support organizations. We are nearly complete in our efforts to consolidate field offices and depots peoples worldwide, we have started to eliminate duplicate corporate fees relating to outside services and we have successfully completed initial cost savings negotiations with a number of key material suppliers.
To date, these actions have resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $25 million. Our strategies is to run the company at a lower combine cost, and the 2 standalone companies would have been separately remaining committed to long-term growth and where necessary sustained long-term investments. 
Subsequent to our prior earnings call, we've received a number of questions about CY '13 operating expenses. We plan to deliver a comprehensive commentary on this at our November Analyst Meeting. But for now want to convey some important headlines.
The combined company cost baseline for the first half of calendar 2012 was approximately $295 million per quarter in OpEx. Standalone Lam had essentially capped operating expenses for calendar '12 to $200 million per quarter, and Novellus, $100 million. The combined company targeted cost synergies are $100 million annualized effective at the end of calendar '13. Approximately 50% of those synergies are planned in operating expenses. The new quarterly operating expense cap is less than $305 million per quarter for the combined company in calendar '13, which would apply to the $1 billion quarterly revenue level. This amounts would include our anticipated cost synergies, it can fund above market growth and would accommodate ramping 450 millimeter equipment development.
Initial modeling should assume a graduate the progression through the year, customary quarterly guidance will, of course, be available ongoing. We anticipate at least currently only modest OpEx expansion in subsequent years. This balanced approach to managing costs while continuing to invest for future growth is crucial in today's rapidly changing business climates and with a high risk and reward industry inflections. We feel that, that target optimizes short and long-term performance appropriately.
Turning now to our outlook for the December 2012 quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: Shipments of $800 million, plus or minus $30 million; revenues of $850 million, plus or minus $30 million; gross margin at 44%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 11%, plus or minus 1.5%; and earnings per share of $0.45, plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares.
And with that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think as we've articulated previously, that's a pretty expensive transition for the foundries. I think the estimates are between 1.3x and 1.4x in terms of costs. And our best estimates in terms of impacts on the etch fab are between 25% and a 35% increase in spending. Naturally, the types of challenges around transitions in that node are definitely appealing to the natural strength of the company in terms of conductor etch, and certainly, that's a very positive headline for the company. As you move towards the FinFET transition, obviously, there's some announcements around adoption of the 16-nanometer or sometimes referred to the 18-nanometers node, and again the types of profile challenges that exist with the vertical structure kind of naturally exploits the strength of the company conductor etch in the logic space, but also demonstrated performance in high etch ratios and some of the memory applications as well. So we're feeling pretty good about the impact on our in those transitions which we think is kind of pretty close to the average WFE transitions for the industry, for the 28 to 20, maybe a little less in the case of etch that I just spoke to and the FinFET transition for us is probably a 15% increase in Sam. So good position and good impact in terms of Sam opportunity."

The first thing to say is we assume both memory and logic have foundry spend money next year. As I think we've articulated probably in equal measure through the year, the breakdown that we're assuming for 2012, WFE is about $8 billion of memory, $5 billion of microprocessor, $12 billion of foundry and 3 logic other. The principal change we believe that exists in terms of segments if you buy into the 30 that we just described is the memory is a little stronger it goes from the $8 billion level to the $10 billion level. That's the place where we're assuming. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One of them is that the assumptions where making on DRAM and I think they're consistent with consensus is slightly stronger, big growth next year at the high 30s, and I'm seeing some memory companies perhaps even speak to a little bit better in some instances. So we're assuming high 30s on the back of a 30% 2012 year. And despite the current environment that we're in with NAND, when we look at the construct of today's installed base and think through the 50% big growth assumption for 2013, we would estimate that there will be about a 150,000 wafer stacks of capacity addition next year and about 450,000 wafer stacks of capacity conversion. And that this is slightly richer ratio biased to the additions that existed in calendar '12. Calendar '12 was the most efficient year in NAND history that's certainly in the last 3 years relative to the mix and conversion. And the 150,000 wafer start number that I just said is our assumption for next year. NAND additions is still meaningfully less on the additions that were made in 2011 and 2010."

And as I said, 70% of the decisions, the N+1 decisions, for credit application to believe are pretty complete at this point in time. So we have reasonably good data on the etch position in foundry. And the patterning layers and hard mask steps in that transition are very beneficial to us given the natural strength of the company through the etch deposition, as I mentioned it's really all about back in line process, diffusion barrier, copper fill, very strong market share positions for the company at the baseline. The deposition of the company is about a 70% market share. So we're coming from a position of strength and that's obviously a very important foundation."

In terms of answering the question specifically about where kind of the NAND investment kind of plays out, today, our customers have done an incredible job basically locking down qualified capacities. So the amount of capacity that's unqualified exiting this year I think it's at an all-time lows. If there's any demand is going to buy its very nature require capacity additions. So I think this switch is going to be really immediate when demand exists. And when you look at some of the signals that demand, we're not lost without demand signals. So although we don't disclose bookings, perhaps to be a little helpful, when we look at our forecast, our bookings forecast in December is slightly greater than our shippings, shipments guidance today.

And in fact, the transition that's gone the other direction to the one that you're hypothesizing, at least in Korea, I think that's the reality. It's not an easy thing to do. It can be a little costly and complicated and challenging. So we're not actually sitting here today with a very missed balanced supply and demand in DRAM. Clearly, the guys that sell DRAM devices can make the choices that you're describing and potentially the economics of DRAM unless you're in the mobile DRAM space are going to kind of motivate people to at least consider it, but it's not easy. So we're not seeing a big supply demand imbalance despite the fact that clearly the economics of DRAM, unless you're at the 3X mode or headed to 2X are very difficult. But at it is at least a theoretical consideration."

The only thing that we've kind of assumed in terms of growth year-over-year from a segment point of view is in the NAND space for the reasons I described. At least our assumption on the PC, which is still pretty impactful in terms of spending, we're only assuming 3% PC unit growth and the range is like wild. I mean, I've seen minus 1 or minus 2 percentage point estimates all the way up to 11. So we're in a fairly conservative range in the 3. So I don't know if there's upside there or not, time will tell. And there's the potential for some upside I think if the 3D NAND transition and/or the 20-nanometer foundry roadmaps kind of pops a little bit faster from people who are expecting.

Relative to the timing of the transition, it's not an easy technical transition. There's still a decent set of unanswered questions on device flow and structure. And the evidence of that is we are continuing to learn about our Sam opportunity. So you will remember in kind of prior quarters, I have said that if you look at kind of action as an etch and deposition as kind of baselines for our company today and you start to model what happens to our Sam or what happens to the cost of 10,000 wafer starts in the planer to 3D transition in the FinFET space and the NAND space, I have said that I believe that our Sam goes up by about 15 percentage points by virtual process time and process flow. And in the last kind of 6 months, the customers made some pretty significant choices around NAND process flow. And I would say that, that 15% that we have stated previously is probably underestimating the opportunity in etch and clean, both by up to a 2x to 3x factor. So the 15 percentage point number that we have said previously has the potential to be 2x or 3x greater than that in this transitions. So it's a very big deal. And that's a big deal in the context of overall WFE because unlike in the logic transition, the requirements for lithography actually get eased in that transition to a 3D structure memories. So not only is it the big deal in terms of the amount of money that gets spend in our segments in a 3D NAND environment. The proportion of WFE that gets assigned to the segments of our business is also increasing."

And so it's predominantly a 28-nanometer year still. I mean, we exit the year at a may be at 240,000 wafer starts, and we believe that the 28-nanometer technology nodes will exceed 300,000 wafer starts ultimately and maybe get to as high as 340 or 350, we'll see.

Statement number 2, at least to our analytics, there's only 20,000 wafer starts globally of unqualified, unused capacity. Unbelievably low.

All metrics mentioned on today's call are for the combined company. And as a reminder, the September quarter results include a full quarter of merger-related activity, while any June quarter comparisons reflect only 20 days work.
Total shipments were $935 million for the September quarter, up 15% from the June quarter and within our previously guided range. As expected, we did see a slight broadening of customers across multiple segments. And to that point, for the September quarter, approximately 20% of our system shipments were for technology nodes greater than 4X, while the remainder of approximately 80% were for applications at the sub-4X technology node.
Segment data is as follows: Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments, while the memory segment accounted for 42% of total system shipments, which include NAND at 22%; DRAM at 19%; and other memory at 1%. Constituting the balance, logic and other were 10% of the total system shipments. 
Revenue in the September quarter was $907 million, up 22% sequentially and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.4%, up 2.3 percentage points from the prior quarter and exceeding the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to solid operational execution and a more favorable product and customer mix. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $284 million, up sequentially from $215 million in June. A more instructional comparison would be the performance of the 2 companies on a stand-alone basis during the March quarter where combined expenses totaled $293 million. Between $5 million and $6 million of the reduction relates to the achievement of OpEx related synergies, while the remainder relates to lower stock compensation expense associated with merger-related acceleration of equity awards.
The combination of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP operating income of $118 million and non-GAAP operating margin of 13%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Relative to our expectations for the quarter, non-GAAP other expenses of $2.2 million was favorably impacted by foreign currency adjustments and interest income.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.3% compared to 16.9% in the June quarter. And presently, we're still expecting a fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens. Should the federal R&D tax credit be extended prior to our fiscal year end, this rate would be reduced to the lower teens. 
Based on the share count of approximately 182 million shares, September quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.53, exceeding the high end of this quarter's guidance by $0.06.
Moving now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments of $2.9 billion versus $3 billion in the prior quarter, with our cash generation for the quarter being offset by our ongoing share repurchase program. 
Day sales outstanding for the September quarter were 64, and inventory turns were 4.0. As you know, we did not report these metrics for the June quarter as the 20 days sub-period related to the Novellus transaction caused these metrics to be unhelpful.
During the September quarter, these metrics for the combined company are aligned with normalized levels. And for comparison, DSO for the March quarter for Lam stand-alone were 65 days, and the inventory turns were 4.2. 
We ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $364 million, excluding approximately $21 million in the shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters.
Cash from operations was $249 million or 27% of revenue in the September quarter. And we currently expect that as a percentage of revenue, CY '13 cash from operations will approximate CY '13 non-GAAP operating income.
Combined company noncash expense includes, among other items, $24 million for equity compensation, $45 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees.
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our ongoing share repurchase activity.
During the September quarter, we spent approximately $344 million repurchasing shares and took delivery of about 12 million shares of common stock, which includes just over 2 million shares received in conjunction with our June quarter expenditures under structured repurchase programs. As indicated previously, our activity during the quarter was more systematic in nature, and we now expect to complete a significant majority of our $1.6 billion share repurchase during 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Martin."

These achievem",1583,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite well-publicized adverse market conditions recently and the associated ongoing cyclical pressures, Lam delivered on all key customer and financial commitments for the September quarter. These achievements reflect incredible levels of commitment from our employees worldwide, continued focus on operational execution and the unwavering focus on our customers and our strategic growth objectives. We're very pleased with our progress.
First today, I'll briefly update our views on the industry. Since our last call, a number of customers lowered their investment plans for the balance of this calendar year. Accordingly, we have further lowered our 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending outlook to a $28 billion to $29 billion range. Having essentially met September guidance, this adjustment impacts the December 2012 quarter significantly, particularly in the area of shipments. Again, the NAND segment accounted for the vast majority of these latest series of spend reductions as manufacturers continue to react to the pricing environments and their view of supply and demand. 
Given the decrease in new capacity additions planned for the balance of calendar '12, we think it is likely we exit this year with very tight NAND device supply, which bodes well for a resurgence of spending in calendar '13, probably in the first half.
Clearly, there is some evidence we are already seeing the impact of this supply situation in NAND ASPs, which has started to increase over this past quarter. This is an important reference point for confidence in future capacity expansion.
While it is still too early to accurately forecast 2013 WFE spend to any significant detail, our initial analysis still supports the prospect for spending once again to be within a range of $30 billion.
Smartphones, tablets and SSDs support the need for new NAND capacity and additional leading-edge foundry and logic investments. These drivers are also positive for mobile DRAM demand. However, projections for PC unit growth and DRAM content growth continue to be modest, resulting in another year of limited DRAM equipment spending most likely.
Considering the fundamentals of WFE capacity and our understanding of demand for electronics products, we would characterize the 2013 WFE spend to have more potential for upside than risk. Needless to say, the often unrelated macro influences independent of the semiconductor cycle are significant to the risk and upside both.
As you might expect in this environment, Lam is even more focused on executing well, managing short-term volatility but staying the course on the primary elements of our longer-term market share growth objectives. We'll spend more time in our upcoming Analyst Meeting in November, focused on communicating progress to date on these long-term items, characterizing their magnitude and the probability of our excess -- of our success exploiting market opportunities and technology inflections.
In calendar year 2013, we expect customers to begin ramping capacity additions for the n+1 technology node, which includes the transition to 14-nanometer for logic and 20-nanometer for foundry. Potential 3D NAND pilot line investments could also begin late in the year. But primarily, we are assuming a planar-based memory WFE for now. 
For Lam, these transitions represent key opportunities and support achieving our stated market share growth objectives. We're pleased with our progress.
It goes without saying that successfully defending existing positions is the most critical foundation of market share sustainability. Building off that foundation with targeted application penetrations to gain share is our proven growth model. 
In etch, clean and deposition, we continue to defend positions well. We believe that approximately 70% of the critical n+1 technology node tool selection decisions have been made at this time. And on that basis, we would estimate our application-based market share for etch, clean and deposition in the low 50s, low to mid-20s and mid-20s percentage range, respectively.
Especially in etch and deposition, recent selection decisions by our customers have demonstrated good progress towards our goals. In clean, we are now more focused on n+2 transitions with the planned release of our next-generation product next year. 
In the remaining 30% of n+1 decisions available and n+2 decisions that will be made in earnest throughout next year, we are targeting additional growth hinged around key technology inflections consistent with achieving our 3- to 5-year targeted market share growth objectives of plus 3 to 5 percentage points for etch, 5 to 10 percentage points for clean and 4 to 8 percentage points for deposition.
In etch, as market share leader for the conductor segment and particularly for critical patterning processes, Lam stands to benefit from the growing number of patterning steps in next-generation foundry and memory devices.
In single wafer clean, we have a position of leadership and back-end-of-line applications and are now focused on delivering enhanced productivity and differentiated process results to better compete for a broad range of applications, including the front-end cleans.
Since the last earnings call, our design solutions have generated considerable interest from leading device manufacturers, with the promise for delivering a flexible architecture and on-wafer performance capabilities aligned with their roadmaps.
Decisions for clean process steps often come later in the selection process as we talked about previously, and we believe there are still opportunities to capture new applications at the n+1 technology node. 
In deposition, Lam holds the leading position for critical back-end-of-line interconnect processes, including diffusion barriers, ultra-low-k film gearing and copper fill. The complexity, in some cases the number of interconnect layers is increasing, which requires more deposition systems to process the same number of wafers.
As a newly formed combined company, we, Lam and Novellus, are more competitive together, and the timing of our transaction fits well with industry transitions. Illustratively, the 3D NAND devices roadmap represents a significant growth opportunity for both etch and depositions, sometimes together through adjacent process leverage. Repeatable and precise process capabilities are critical to 3D NAND device performance, our ability to etch high aspect ratio structures and deposit atomically smooth film stacks both uniformly and repeatedly position us well for opportunities in dielectric etch and PECVD both.
Overall, we're delighted by the interaction and excitement shared among our combined engineering and field organizations, more by the results already evidenced to identify and develop strategies for accelerating Lam's growth. 
Worthy of note, we are already targeting incremental revenues in calendar '13 in excess of our stated synergy cost reductions. We continue to execute plans to combine our key business processes, management systems and infrastructure. The magnitude of these projects is sizable and includes, among other areas, the integration of both company's IT infrastructures, HR platforms and the integration of our ERP systems and processes. 
We completed a thorough assessment of these projects early on and have developed plans which addressed potential risks. I'm pleased with the pace and progress of our efforts so far, which we are largely targeting to complete by mid-2013 when a number of step function cost synergy actions become possible.
Since closing the Novellus transaction in early June, we've made significant progress against our cost synergy targets. We are rationalizing our infrastructure at the executive level and across our regional management team and support organizations. We are nearly compete -- complete in our efforts to consolidate field offices and spare depots worldwide. We have started to eliminate duplicate corporate fees relating to outside services, and we have successfully concluded initial cost savings negotiations with a number of key material suppliers.
To date, these actions have resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $25 million. Our strategy is to run the company at a lower combined cost than the 2 stand-alone companies would have done separately, remaining committed to long-term growth and, where necessary, sustained long-term investments.
Subsequent to our prior earnings call, we had received a number of questions about CY '13 operating expenses. We plan to deliver a comprehensive commentary on this at our November Analyst Meeting, but for now want to convey some important headlines.
The combined company cost baseline for the first half of calendar 2012 was approximately $295 million per quarter in OpEx. Stand-alone Lam had essentially capped operating expenses for calendar '12 to $200 million per quarter, and Novellus, $100 million. The combined-company targeted cost synergies are $100 million annualized effective at the end of calendar '13. Approximately, 50% of those synergies are planned in operating expenses. 
The new quarterly operating expense cap is less than $305 million per quarter for the combined company in calendar '13, which would apply to the $1 billion quarterly revenue level. This amount would include our anticipated cost synergies. It would fund above market growth and would accommodate ramping 450-millimeter equipment development. Initial modeling should assume a graduated progression through the year, customary quarterly guidance will, of course, be available ongoing. We anticipate, at least currently, only modest OpEx expansion in subsequent years. 
This balanced approach to managing costs while continuing to invest for future growth is crucial in today's rapidly changing business climates and with high risk and reward industry inflections. We feel that this target optimizes short- and long-term performance appropriately.
Turning now to our outlook for the December 2012 quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: Shipments of $800 million, plus or minus $30 million; revenues of $850 million, plus or minus $30 million; gross margin at 44%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 11%, plus or minus 1.5%; and earnings per share of $0.45, plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares.
And with that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

As I think we've articulated previously, that's a pretty expensive transition for the foundries. I think the estimates are between 1.3x and 1.4x in terms of cost. And our best estimates in terms of impacts on the etch fab are between a 25% and a 35% increase in spending. Naturally, the types of challenges around metal hard mask transitions in that node are definitely appealing to the natural strength of the company in terms of conductor etch. And certainly, that's a very positive headline for the company. As you move towards the FinFET transition, obviously, there's some announcements around adoption of the 16-nanometer or sometimes referred to 18-nanometer node. And again, the types of profile challenges that exist with the vertical structure kind of naturally exploits the strengths of the company conductor etch in the logic space, but also demonstrated performance in high-aspect ratio features and some of the memory applications as well. So we're feeling pretty good about the impact on our SAM in those transitions, which we think is kind of pretty close to the average WFE transitions for the industry, for the 28 to 20, maybe a little less in the case of etch that I just spoke to. And the FinFET transition for us is probably a 15% increase in SAM. So good position and good impact in terms of SAM opportunity."

I guess first thing to say is we assume both memory and logic in foundry spend money next year.

I guess first thing to say is we assume both memory and logic in foundry spend money next year. As I think we've articulated probably in equal measure through the year, the breakdown that we're assuming for 2012, WFE is about $8 billion of memory, $5 billion of microprocessor, $12 billion of foundry and 3 logic other. The principal change we believe that exists in terms of segments if you buy into the 30% that we've just described is the memory is a little stronger. It goes from the $8 billion level to the $10 billion level. That's the place that we're assuming. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One of them is that for the assumptions we're making on DRAM bit growth, and I think they're consistent with consensus, is slightly stronger bit growth next year at the high 30s. And I'm seeing some memory companies perhaps even speak to a little bit better in some instances. So we're assuming high 30s on the back of a 30% 2012 year. And despite the current environment that we're in with NAND, when we look at the construct of today's installed base and think through the 50% bit growth assumption for 2013, we would estimate that there will be about a 150,000 wafer starts of capacity addition next year and about 450,000 wafer starts of capacity conversion. And that this is a slightly richer ratio biased to the additions that existed in calendar '12. Calendar '12 was the most efficient year in NAND history. That's certainly in the last 3 years relative to the mix of addition and conversion. And the 150,000 wafer start number that I just said is our assumption for next year NAND additions. It's still meaningfully less on the additions that were made in 2011 and 2010."

And as I said, 70% of the decisions, the n+1 decisions for critical applications, we believe, are pretty complete at this point in time. So we have reasonably good data on the etch position in foundry. And the patterning layers and hard mask steps in that transition are very beneficial to us given the natural strength of the company in conductor etch deposition.

In terms of answering the question specifically about where kind of a NAND investment kind of plays out, today, our customers have done an incredible job basically locking down qualified capacity. And so the amount of capacity that's unqualified exiting this year, I think it's at an all-time low. So if there's any demand, it's going to, by its very nature, require capacity addition. So I think the switch is going to be really immediate when demand exists. And when you look at some of the signals of demand, I mean, we're not lost without demand signals. So although we don't disclose bookings, perhaps to be a little helpful, if -- when we look at our forecast, our bookings forecast in December is slightly greater than our shippings guidance -- shipments guidance today.

At least our assumption on the PC, which is still pretty impactful in terms of spending, we're only assuming 3% PC unit growth, and the range is like wild. I mean, I've seen minus 1 or minus 2 percentage point estimates all the way up to 11. So we're in a fairly conservative range at the 3. So I don't know if there's upside there or not. Well, time will tell. And there's the potential for some upside, I think, if the 3D NAND transition and/or the 20-nanometer foundry roadmaps kind of popped a little bit faster than people are expecting.

Relative to the timing of the transition, it's not an easy technical transition. There's still a decent set of unanswered questions on device flow and structure. And an evidence of that is we are continuing to learn about our SAM opportunity. So you will remember in kind of prior quarters, I have said that if you look at kind of etch as a -- etch and deposition as kind of baselines for our company today, and you start to model what happens to our SAM or what happens to the cost of 10,000 wafer starts in a planar to 3D transition in the FinFET space and the NAND space, I had said I believe that our SAM goes up by about 15 percentage points by virtue of process time and process flow. And in the last kind of 6 months, the customers made some pretty significant choices around NAND process flow. And I would say that that 15% that we have stated previously is probably underestimating the opportunity in etch and clean, both by up to a 2 to 3x factor. So the 15-percentage point number that we have said previously has the potential to be 2 or 3x greater than that in this transition. So it's a very big deal. And that's a big deal in the context of overall WFE because unlike in the logic transition, the requirements for lithography actually get eased in that transition to a 3D structure memory. So not only is it a big deal in terms of the amount of money that gets spent in our segments in a 3D NAND environment.

I said I thought 25% to 30% was the SAM expansion potential for etch, deposition a little less than that and clean is kind of to be determined. It's all about a yield play. So we really don't know how to answer that question until we get there. And there is a reasonable potential for -- in the range of 25,000 to 30,000 wafer starts of 20-nanometer capacity to be added next year. That's our assumption right now. And so it's predominantly a 28-nanometer year still. I mean, we exit this year at maybe at 240,000 wafer starts, and we believe that the 28-nanometer technology nodes will exceed 300,000 wafer starts ultimately and maybe get to as high as 340,000 or 350,000. We'll see. So it's really a 28 year, with initial 20. Answering the reuse question is pretty difficult at this point. I would tend to think reuse potential is very low. It's not an established model in the foundry, certainly in the 40 to 32 and 28 transitions. There was a little bit more than historically.

I would say, first of all, I don't think anything happens kind of anytime soon. I think consistent with comments from other equipment companies, we're certainly in a lull in December and probably in a lull in March as well, and we'll see when we get to the June quarter. But relative to confidence, I don't think we have an extravagant characterization of bit growth in calendar '13. We're assuming 50%. 50% is the lowest percentage of bit growth in any of the last 4 years. That's kind of statement number one. Statement number two, at least to our analytics, there's only 20,000 wafer starts globally of unqualified, unused capacity. Unbelievably low. And so any demand that comes in is going to be a catalyst for spending. Now the spending can come in many forms, to your point. But at least to date, we have not learned anything from customers that will cost us to model the outlook differently. Obviously, if we do and when we do, we'll share that perspective with you. And at the end of the day, the NAND investment, and like any segment, frankly, is all about demand and supply, but it's also about the availability to upgrade the existing installed base. And in calendar 2012, we probably have seen 70,000 wafer starts of new capacity added by the end of this year in support of a 65% bit growth. And we're assuming about 150,000 wafer starts of additional last year, with about 100,000 wafer starts of less conversion in '13 that occurred in '12. So that mix has the potential to change the answer to the question. We've done our best to tell you what we think the outlook is, and our best estimate is 150,000 wafer starts of additional next year and 450,000 wafer starts of conversion. And the additions will cost about $280 million, $285 million, $290 million per 10,000 wafer starts and the conversions we think cost about $50 million to $60 million per 10,000 wafer starts next year."

I'm pleased to report good results for the quarter ended September 23. All metrics mentioned on today's call are for the combined company.

All metrics mentioned on today's call are for the combined company. And as a reminder, the September quarter results include a full quarter of merger-related activity, while any June quarter comparisons reflect only 20 days work.
Total shipments were $935 million for the September quarter, up 15% from the June quarter and within our previously guided range. As expected, we did see a slight broadening of customers across multiple segments. And to that point, for the September quarter, approximately 20% of our system shipments were for technology nodes greater than 4X, while the remainder of approximately 80% were for applications at the sub-4X technology node.
Segment data is as follows: Foundry shipments accounted for 48% of total system shipments, while the memory segment accounted for 42% of total system shipments, which include NAND at 22%; DRAM at 19%; and other memory at 1%. Constituting the balance, logic and other were 10% of the total system shipments. 
Revenue in the September quarter was $907 million, up 22% sequentially and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.4%, up 2.3 percentage points from the prior quarter and exceeding the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to solid operational execution and a more favorable product and customer mix. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were approximately $284 million, up sequentially from $215 million in June. A more instructional comparison would be the performance of the 2 companies on a stand-alone basis during the March quarter where combined expenses totaled $293 million. Between $5 million and $6 million of the reduction relates to the achievement of OpEx related synergies, while the remainder relates to lower stock compensation expense associated with merger-related acceleration of equity awards.
The combination of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses resulted in non-GAAP operating income of $118 million and non-GAAP operating margin of 13%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Relative to our expectations for the quarter, non-GAAP other expenses of $2.2 million was favorably impacted by foreign currency adjustments and interest income.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.3% compared to 16.9% in the June quarter. And presently, we're still expecting a fiscal year non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens. Should the federal R&D tax credit be extended prior to our fiscal year end, this rate would be reduced to the lower teens. 
Based on a share count of approximately 182 million shares, September quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.53, exceeding the high end of this quarter's guidance by $0.06.
Moving now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash and investments of $2.9 billion versus $3 billion in the prior quarter, with our cash generation for the quarter being offset by our ongoing share repurchase program. 
Day sales outstanding for the September quarter were 64, and inventory turns were 4.0. As you know, we did not report these metrics for the June quarter as the 20 days stub period related to the Novellus transaction caused these metrics to be unhelpful.
During the September quarter, these metrics for the combined company are aligned with normalized levels. And for comparison, DSO for the March quarter for Lam stand-alone were 65 days, and the inventory turns were 4.2. 
We ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $364 million, excluding approximately $21 million in the shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters.
Cash from operations was $249 million or 27% of revenue in the September quarter. And we currently expect that as a percentage of revenue, CY '13 cash from operations will approximate CY '13 non-GAAP operating income.
Combined company noncash expense includes, among other items, $24 million for equity compensation, $45 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million, and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 regular full-time employees.
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our ongoing share repurchase activity.
During the September quarter, we spent approximately $344 million repurchasing shares and took delivery of about 12 million shares of common stock, which includes just over 2 million shares received in conjunction with our June quarter expenditures under structured repurchase programs. As indicated previously, our activity during the quarter was more systematic in nature, and we now expect to complete a significant majority of our $1.6 billion share repurchase during 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Martin."
30655,217781502,366044,"Lam Research Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone.

These achievem",1586,"Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite well-publicized adverse market conditions recently and the associated ongoing cyclical pressures, Lam delivered on all key customer and financial commitments for the September quarter. These achievements reflect incredible levels of commitment from our employees worldwide, continued focus on operational execution and the unwavering focus on our customers and our strategic growth objectives. We're very pleased with our progress.
First today, I'll briefly update our views on the industry. Since our last call, a number of customers lowered their investment plans for the balance of this calendar year. Accordingly, we have further lowered our 2012 wafer fabrication equipment spending outlook to a $28 billion to $29 billion range. Having essentially met September guidance, this adjustment impacts the December 2012 quarter significantly, particularly in the area of shipments. Again, the NAND segment accounted for the vast majority of this latest series of spend reductions as manufacturers continue to react to the pricing environments and their view of supply and demand. 
Given the decrease in new capacity additions planned for the balance of calendar '12, we think it is likely they exit this year with very tight NAND device supply, which bodes well for a resurgence of spending in calendar '13, probably in the first half.
Clearly, there is some evidence we are already seeing the impact of this supply situation in NAND ASPs, which has started to increase over this past quarter. This is an important reference point for confidence in future capacity expansion.
While it is still too early to accurately forecast 2013 WFE spend to any significant detail, our initial analysis still supports the prospect for spending, once again, to be within a range of $30 billion.
Smartphones, tablets and SSDs support the need for new NAND capacity and additional leading-edge foundry and logic investments. These drivers are also positive for mobile DRAM demand. However, projections for PC unit growth and DRAM content growth continue to be modest, resulting in another year of limited DRAM equipment spending, most likely.
Considering the fundamentals of WFE capacity and our understanding of demand for electronics products, we would characterize the 2013 WFE spend to have more potential for upside than risk. Needless to say, the often unrelated macro influences independent of the semiconductor cycle are significant to the risk and upside both.
As you might expect in this environment, Lam is even more focused on executing well, managing short-term volatility but staying the course on the primary elements of our longer-term market share growth objectives. We'll spend more time in our upcoming Analyst Meeting in November, focused on communicating progress to date on these long-term items, characterizing their magnitude and the probability of our excess -- of our success exploiting market opportunities and technology inflections.
In calendar year 2013, we expect customers to begin ramping capacity additions for the n+1 technology node, which includes the transition to 40 [ph] -nanometer for logic and 20-nanometer for foundry. Potential 3D NAND pilot line investments could also begin late in the year. But primarily, we are assuming a planar-based memory WFE for now. 
For Lam, these transitions represent key opportunities and support achieving our stated market share growth objectives. We're pleased with our progress.
It goes without saying that successfully defending existing positions is the most critical foundation of market share sustainability. Building off that foundation with targeted application penetrations to gain share is our proven growth model. 
In etch, clean and deposition, we continue to defend positions well. We believe that approximately 70% of the critical n+1 technology node tool selection decisions have been made at this time. And on that basis, we would estimate our application-based market share for etch, clean and deposition in the low 50s, low to mid-20s and mid-20s percentage range, respectively.
Especially in etch and deposition, recent selection decisions by our customers have demonstrated good progress towards our goals. In clean, we are now more focused on n+2 transitions with the planned release of our next-generation product next year. 
In the remaining 30% of n+1 decisions available and n+2 decisions that will be made in earnest throughout next year, we are targeting additional growth hinged around key technology inflections consistent with achieving our 3- to 5-year targeted market share growth objectives of plus 3 to 5 percentage points for etch, 5 to 10 percentage points for clean and 4 to 8 percentage points for deposition.
In etch, as market share leader for the conductor segments and particularly for critical patterning processes, Lam stands to benefit from the growing number of patterning steps in next-generation foundry and memory devices.
In single wafer clean, we have a position of leadership in back-end-of-line applications and are now focused on delivering enhanced productivity and differentiated process results to better compete for a broader range of applications, including the front-end cleans.
Since the last earnings call, our design solutions have generated considerable interest from leading device manufacturers, with the promise for delivering a flexible architecture and on-wafer performance capabilities aligned with their roadmaps.
Decisions for clean process steps often come later in the selection process as we talked about previously, and we believe there are still opportunities to capture new applications at the n+1 technology node. 
In deposition, Lam holds the leading position for critical back-end-of-line interconnect processes, including diffusion barriers, ultra-low-k film gearing and copper fill. The complexity, in some cases the number of interconnect layers, is increasing, which requires more deposition systems to process the same number of wafers.
As a newly formed combined company, we, Lam and Novellus, are more competitive together, and the timing of our transaction fits well with industry transitions. Illustratively, the 3D NAND devices roadmap represents a significant growth opportunity for both etch and depositions, sometimes together through adjacent process leverage. Repeatable and precise process capabilities are critical to 3D NAND device performance, our ability to etch high aspect ratio structures and deposit atomically smooth film stacks both uniformly and repeatedly position us well for opportunities in dielectric etch and PECVD both.
Overall, we're delighted by the interaction and excitement shared among our combined engineering and field organizations, more by the results already evidenced to identify and develop strategies for accelerating Lam's growth. 
Worthy of note, we are already targeting incremental revenues in calendar '13 in excess of our stated synergy cost reductions. We continue to execute plans to combine our key business processes, management systems and infrastructure. The magnitude of these projects is sizable and includes, among other areas, the integration of both company's IT infrastructures, HR platforms and the integration of our ERP systems and processes. 
We completed a thorough assessment of these projects early on and have developed plans which address potential risks. I'm pleased with the pace and progress of our efforts so far, which we are largely targeting to complete by mid-2013, when a number of step function cost synergy actions become possible.
Since closing the Novellus transaction in early June, we've made significant progress against our cost synergy targets. We are rationalizing our infrastructure at the executive level and across our regional management team and support organizations. We are nearly compete -- complete in our efforts to consolidate field offices and spare depots worldwide. We have started to eliminate duplicate corporate fees relating to outside services, and we have successfully concluded initial cost savings negotiations with a number of key material suppliers.
To date, these actions have resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $25 million. Our strategy is to run the company at a lower combined cost than the 2 stand-alone companies would have done separately, remaining committed to long-term growth and, where necessary, sustained long-term investments.
Subsequent to our prior earnings call, we had received a number of questions about CY '13 operating expenses. We plan to deliver a comprehensive commentary on this at our November Analyst Meeting, but for now want to convey some important headlines.
The combined company cost baseline for the first half of calendar 2012 was approximately $295 million per quarter in OpEx. Stand-alone Lam had essentially capped operating expenses for calendar '12 to $200 million per quarter, and Novellus, $100 million. The combined company targeted cost synergies are $100 million annualized effective at the end of calendar '13. Approximately 50% of those synergies are planned in operating expenses. 
The new quarterly operating expense cap is less than $305 million per quarter for the combined company in calendar '13, which would apply to the $1 billion quarterly revenue level. This amount would include our anticipated cost synergies. It would fund above market growth and would accommodate ramping 450-millimeter equipment development. Initial modeling should assume a graduated progression through the year. Customary quarterly guidance will, of course, be available ongoing. We anticipate, at least currently, only modest OpEx expansion in subsequent years. 
This balanced approach to managing costs while continuing to invest for future growth is crucial in today's rapidly changing business climates and with high risk and reward industry inflections. We feel that this target optimizes short- and long-term performance appropriately.
Turning now to our outlook for the December 2012 quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: Shipments of $800 million, plus or minus $30 million; revenues of $850 million, plus or minus $30 million; gross margin at 44%, plus or minus 1%; operating profit at 11%, plus or minus 1.5%; and earnings per share of $0.45, plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares.
And with that, Ernie and I will be happy to take your questions."

As I think we've articulated previously, that's a pretty expensive transition for the foundries. I think the estimates are between 1.3x and 1.4x in terms of cost. And our best estimates in terms of impacts on the etch fab [ph] are between a 25% and a 35% increase in spending. Naturally, the types of challenges around metal hard mask transitions in that node are definitely appealing to the natural strength of the company in terms of conductor etch. And certainly, that's a very positive headline for the company. As you move towards the FinFET transition, obviously, there's some announcements around adoption of the 16-nanometer or sometimes referred to 18-nanometer node. And again, the types of profile challenges that exist with the vertical structure kind of naturally exploits the strengths of the company conductor etch in the logic space, but also demonstrated performance in high-aspect ratio features in some of the memory applications as well. So we're feeling pretty good about the impact on our SAM in those transitions, which we think is kind of pretty close to the average WFE transitions for the industry, for the 28 to 20, maybe a little less in the case of etch, as I just spoke to. And the FinFET transition for us is probably a 15% increase in SAM. So good position and good impact in terms of SAM opportunity."

I guess first thing to say is we assume both memory and logic and foundry spend money next year. As I think we've articulated probably in equal measure through the year, the breakdown that we're assuming for 2012, WFE is about $8 billion of memory, $5 billion of microprocessor, $12 billion of foundry and $3 billion logic/other. The principal change we believe that exists in terms of segments if you buy into the $30 billion that we've just described, is that memory is a little stronger. It goes from the $8 billion level to the $10 billion level. That's the placeholder we're assuming. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One of them is that for the assumptions we're making on DRAM bit growth, and I think they're consistent with consensus, is slightly stronger bit growth next year at the high 30s. And I'm seeing some memory companies perhaps even speak to a little bit better in some instances. So we're assuming high 30s on the back of a 30% 2012 year. And despite the current environments that we're in with NAND, when we look at the construct of today's installed base and think through the 50% bit growth assumption for 2013, we would estimate that there will be about a 150,000 wafer starts of capacity addition next year and about 450,000 wafer starts of capacity conversion. And that is a slightly richer ratio biased to the additions that existed in calendar '12. Calendar '12 was the most efficient year in NAND history. That's certainly in the last 3 years relative to the mix of addition and conversion. And the 150,000 wafer start number that I just said is our assumption for next year NAND additions. It's still meaningfully less than the additions that were made in 2011 and 2010."

In terms of answering the question specifically about where kind of a NAND investment kind of plays out, today, our customers have done an incredible job basically locking down qualified capacity. And so the amount of capacity that's unqualified exiting this year, I think it's at an all-time low. So if there's any demand, it's going to, by its very nature, require capacity addition. So I think the switch is going to be really immediate when demand exists. And when you look at some of the signals of demand, I mean, we're not lost without demand signals. So although we don't disclose bookings, perhaps to be a little helpful, if -- when we look at our forecast, our bookings forecast in December is slightly greater than our shippings guidance -- shipments guidance today.

And in the last kind of 6 months, the customers made some pretty significant choices around NAND process flow. And I would say that, that 15% that we have stated previously is probably underestimating the opportunity in etch and clean, both by up to a 2 to 3x factor. So the 15-percentage point number that we have said previously has the potential to be 2 or 3x greater than, that in this transition. So it's a very big deal. And that's a big deal in the context of overall WFE because unlike in the logic transition, the requirements for lithography actually get eased in that transition to a 3D structure memory.

I said I thought 25% to 35% was the SAM expansion potential for etch, deposition a little less than that and clean is kind of to be determined. It's all about a yield play. So we really don't know how to answer that question until we get there. And there is a reasonable potential for -- in the range of 25,000 to 30,000 wafer starts of 20-nanometer capacity to be added next year. That's our assumption right now. And so it's predominantly a 28-nanometer year still. I mean, we exit this year at maybe at 240,000 wafer starts, and we believe that the 28-nanometer technology nodes will exceed 300,000 wafer starts ultimately and maybe get to as high as 340,000 or 350,000. We'll see. So it's really a 28 year, with initial 20. Answering the reuse question is pretty difficult at this point. I would tend to think reuse potential is very low. It's not an established model in the foundry, certainly in the 40 to 32 and 28 transitions. There was a little bit more than historically. But it's a tough place to do reuse on any significant scale."

I would say, first of all, I don't think anything happens kind of anytime soon. I think consistent with comments from other equipment companies, we're certainly in a lull in December and probably in a lull in March as well, and we'll see when we get to the June quarter. But relative to confidence, I don't think we have an extravagant characterization of bit growth in calendar '13. We're assuming 50%. 50% is the lowest percentage of bit growth in any of the last 4 years. That's kind of statement #1. Statement #2, at least to our analytics, there's only 20,000 wafer starts globally of unqualified, unused capacity. Unbelievably low. And so any demand that comes in is going to be a catalyst for spending. Now the spending can come in many forms, to your point. But at least to date, we have not learned anything from customers that would  cause us to model the outlook differently. Obviously, if we do and when we do, we'll share that perspective with you. And at the end of the day, the NAND investment, and like any segment, frankly, is all about demand and supply, but it's also about the availability to upgrade the existing installed base. And in calendar 2012, we probably have seen 70,000 wafer starts of new capacity added by the end of this year in support of a 65% bit growth. And we're assuming about 150,000 wafer starts of addition next year, with about 100,000 wafer starts of less conversion in '13 than occurred in '12. So that mix has the potential to change the answer to the question. We've done our best to tell you what we think the outlook is, and our best estimate is 150,000 wafer starts of addition next year and 450,000 wafer starts of conversion. And the additions will cost about $280 million, $285 million, $290 million per 10,000 wafer starts and the conversions we think cost about $50 million to $60 million per 10,000 wafer starts next year."
