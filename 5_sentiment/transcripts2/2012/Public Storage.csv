Our fourth quarter core FFO per share was $1.66, compared to $1.45 last year, a 15% increase. Five items contributed to this growth. First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.1%, adding $0.09 per share. Non-same-store properties provided $0.03 per share. Buying affiliated partnership interest in the third quarter added $0.02. Our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.02 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures; and lower financing cost added $0.05 per share. We recently completed several capital transactions in the first quarter. We issued $460 million of 5.9% preferred stock, a record low coupon rate for us. We also announced the redemption of 3 preferred series totaling $357 million, having a blended rate of 6.75%. There will be a charge recorded in the first quarter associated with redemptions of about $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
As a result of recent capital transactions, preferred dividends are expected to be about $4 million lower in the first quarter. In November, Shurgard Europe completed the refinancing of its joint venture loans with a new EUR 215 million term loan. This new loan, which will mature in November of 2014, has an interest rate of about 125 basis points lower than the joint venture loans. We also extended the maturity date of our 9% loan to Shurgard Europe to February 2015. We expect nominal paydowns on our loan in 2012. We increased our quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, representing an increase of 16%. Since 2007, our dividend has more than doubled. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has to been to distribute only our taxable income. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

Our same-store movements were up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, offset by higher moveouts of 3%. By the end of January 2012, occupancy, in-place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. In Q4, all of our markets achieved positive revenue growth. The Detroit and Dallas markets led the country, with growth of about 8%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 3%. San Francisco, our second-largest market, increased by 5.4%, and the Northeast markets grew by 6.1%. Given these positive trends in occupancies and rates, we expect our Q1 media spend will be about $1 million lower. Overall, we had a solid 2011. Our same-store properties generated NOI growth of 6% and we achieved record high occupancies of 91.1% for the year. We acquired about $500 million of various property interests and reduced leverage both preferred by another $500 million. We have positive momentum going into 2012.

Our fourth quarter core FFO per share was $1.66 compared to $1.45 last year, a 15% increase. Five items contributed to this growth: First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.1%, adding $0.09 per share; nonsame-store properties provided $0.03 per share; buying affiliated partnership interest in the third quarter added $0.02; our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.02 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures; and lower financing cost added $0.05 per share. We recently completed several capital transactions in the first quarter. We issued $460 million of 5.9% preferred stock, a record low coupon rate for us. We also announced the redemption of 3 preferred series totaling $357 million, having a blended rate of 6.75%. There will be a charge recorded in the first quarter associated with redemptions of about $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
As a result of recent capital transactions, preferred dividends are expected to be about $4 million lower in the first quarter. In November, Shurgard Europe completed the refinancing of its joint venture loans with a new EUR 215 million term loan. This new loan, which will mature in November of 2014, has an interest rate of about 125 basis points lower than the joint venture loans. We also extended the maturity date of our 9% loan to Shurgard Europe to February 2015. We expect nominal paydowns on our loan in 2012. We increased our quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, representing an increase of 16%. Since 2007, our dividend has more than doubled. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.

Our same-store movements were up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, offset by higher move-outs of 3%. By the end of January 2012, occupancy, in-place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. In Q4, all of our markets achieved positive revenue growth.

San Francisco, our second largest market, increased by 5.4%, and the northeast markets grew by 6.1%. Given these positive trends in occupancies and rates, we expect our Q1 media spend will be about $1 million lower. Overall, we had a solid 2011. Our same-store properties generated NOI growth of 6% and we achieved record high occupancies of 91.1% for the year. We acquired about $500 million of various property interests and reduced leverage both debt and preferred by another $500 million. We have positive momentum going into 2012.

If you're going to do a development program, you have to get site acquisition people. That takes time for them to find properties. It takes 6 to 9 months to build the properties and 2 to 3 years to lease them up. So if we started development today, it will be 4 to 5 years before you really saw the stabilized income from those development activities. So it's a big decision in terms of undertaking a development program."

While we had some, I think, extra space, had some -- as a percentage of new supply over the last decade, it was a very small fraction of the total new supply coming in the market were from public companies. So you got the local guys who were there, who were able to get very attractive financing either from banks or in the CMBS market. And I don't see that source of financing coming back anytime soon, much different than the apartment guys that have Fannie and Freddie to finance apartments. That simply doesn't exist in the self-storage business, and I've heard nothing to indicate that, that market is coming back anytime soon. So to speak, a great supplier, the local operator, is very capital constrained right now. And so for the industry, it's great in terms of supply, demand. You could see everyone's having a higher demand for their product, better pricing with very little supply on the horizon in the near term. And I would even say, the supply, longer term, it will be challenging to add meaningful new product to the industry."

The returns are quite exceptional, well into the double digits as you can imagine because there's no laying costs and the incremental costs of building is somewhere between $30 and $50 a foot.

Five items contributed to this growth: First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.1%, adding $0.09 per share; nonsame-store properties provided $0.03 per share; buying affiliated partnership interest in the third quarter added $0.02; our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.02 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures; and lower financing cost added $0.05 per share. We recently completed several capital transactions in the first quarter. We issued $460 million of 5.9% preferred stock, a record low coupon rate for us. We also announced the redemption of 3 preferred series totaling $357 million, having a blended rate of 6.75%. There will be a charge recorded in the first quarter associated with redemptions of about $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
As a result of recent capital transactions, preferred dividends are expected to be about $4 million lower in the first quarter. In November, Shurgard Europe completed the refinancing of its joint venture loans with a new EUR 215 million term loan. This new loan, which will mature in November of 2014, has an interest rate of about 125 basis points lower than the joint venture loans. We also extended the maturity date of our 9% loan to Shurgard Europe to February 2015. We expect nominal paydowns on our loan in 2012. We increased our quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, representing an increase of 16%. Since 2007, our dividend has more than doubled. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.

While we had some, I think, extra space, had some -- as a percentage of new supply over the last decade, it was a very small fraction of the total new supply coming in the market were from public companies. So you got the local guys who were there, who were able to get very attractive financing either from banks or in the CMBS market. And I don't see that source of financing coming back anytime soon, much different than the apartment guys that have Fannie and Freddie to finance apartments. That simply doesn't exist in the self-storage business, and I've heard nothing to indicate that, that market is coming back anytime soon. So to speak, a great supplier, the local operator, is very capital constrained right now. And so for the industry, it's great in terms of supply, demand. You could see everyone's having a higher demand for their product, better pricing with very little supply on the horizon in the near term.

Five items contributed to this growth: First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.1%, adding $0.09 per share; nonsame-store properties provided $0.03 per share; buying affiliated partnership interest in the third quarter added $0.02; our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.02 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures; and lower financing cost added $0.05 per share. We recently completed several capital transactions in the first quarter. We issued $460 million of 5.9% preferred stock, a record low coupon rate for us. We also announced the redemption of 3 preferred series totaling $357 million, having a blended rate of 6.75%. There will be a charge recorded in the first quarter associated with redemptions of about $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
As a result of recent capital transactions, preferred dividends are expected to be about $4 million lower in the first quarter. In November, Shurgard Europe completed the refinancing of its joint venture loans with a new EUR 215 million term loan. This new loan, which will mature in November of 2014, has an interest rate of about 125 basis points lower than the joint venture loans. We also extended the maturity date of our 9% loan to Shurgard Europe to February 2015. We expect nominal paydowns on our loan in 2012. We increased our quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, representing an increase of 16%. Since 2007, our dividend has more than doubled. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.

That simply doesn't exist in the self-storage business, and I've heard nothing to indicate that, that market is coming back anytime soon. So to speak, a great supplier, the local operator, is very capital constrained right now. And so for the industry, it's great in terms of supply, demand.

Our fourth quarter core FFO per share was $1.66 compared to $1.45 last year, a 15% increase. Five items contributed to this growth: First, our same-store net operating income increased by 6.1%, adding $0.09 per share; nonsame-store properties provided $0.03 per share; buying affiliated partnership interest in the third quarter added $0.02; our investment in Shurgard Europe added $0.02 per share, driven primarily by Shurgard's first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in 2 joint ventures; and lower financing cost added $0.05 per share. We recently completed several capital transactions in the first quarter. We issued $460 million of 5.9% preferred stock, a record low coupon rate for us. We also announced the redemption of 3 preferred series totaling $357 million, having a blended rate of 6.75%. There will be a charge recorded in the first quarter associated with redemptions of about $13 million or $0.08 per share. 
As a result of recent capital transactions, preferred dividends are expected to be about $4 million lower in the first quarter. In November, Shurgard Europe completed the refinancing of its joint venture loans with a new EUR 215 million term loan. This new loan, which will mature in November of 2014, has an interest rate of about 125 basis points lower than the joint venture loans. We also extended the maturity date of our 9% loan to Shurgard Europe to February 2015. We expect nominal paydowns on our loan in 2012. We increased our quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, representing an increase of 16%. Since 2007, our dividend has more than doubled. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.

Our same-store movements were up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, offset by higher move-outs of 3%. By the end of January 2012, occupancy, in-place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year. In Q4, all of our markets achieved positive revenue growth. The Detroit and Dallas markets led the country, with growth of about 8%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 3%. San Francisco, our second largest market, increased by 5.4%, and the northeast markets grew by 6.1%. Given these positive trends in occupancies and rates, we expect our Q1 media spend will be about $1 million lower. Overall, we had a solid 2011. Our same-store properties generated NOI growth of 6% and we achieved record high occupancies of 91.1% for the year. We acquired about $500 million of various property interests and reduced leverage both debt and preferred by another $500 million. We have positive momentum going into 2012.

The returns are quite exceptional, well into the double digits as you can imagine because there's no land costs and the incremental costs of building is somewhere between $30 and $50 a foot.

Last year's acquisition of affiliated partnership interest added $0.02. Lower financing cost added $0.02. And ancillary operations, primarily our tenant reinsurance business, added $0.01. 
In the press release, we changed some of our presentation. First, we increased the size of our same-store pools to include properties that we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For our U.S. same stores, we increased the pool by 10. For Shurgard Europe, the pool is increased by 13. We also modified our same-store expense classification to highlight other direct property costs, supervisory payroll and allocated overhead. Other self-storage companies may include some or all of these cost synergies in their expenses. While we modified the presentation, we did not change what is included in our same-store expenses. 
We completed several capital transactions in 2012. We issued $923 million of preferred securities with a blended rate of 5.8%, and redeemed $833 million with an average rate of 6.7%. We have about $4 million of negative carry in the first quarter associated with these issuances. In addition, on July 2, we will redeem $173 million of our 7% Series and preferred stock. We expect to record an EITF charge of approximately $5.4 million in the second quarter.

Our same-store movements were up 2% year-over-year, offset in part by higher moveouts of 5%. At the end of April, occupancy, in-place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year despite lower media spend for the period. In Q1, all of our markets achieved positive revenue growth. Dallas, Denver and Detroit markets led the country with revenue growth over 7%. Miami market was second at 6.3%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew 3.5%; and San Francisco, our second largest market, increased revenues 6% for the quarter. 
Given these positive trends in occupancies and rates, we expect our Q2 media spend will be comparable to last year. In Europe, same-store rental revenues were flat last year, as higher realized rents were offset by lower occupancy. We did improve the year-over-year growth occupancy gap from 1.2% at the end of the year to 0.7% at the end of March. Operating expenses were lower, resulting in NOI growth of about 1%. We continue to expect a challenging operating environment in Europe for the remainder of the year.

That was up about $2.5 million. And you can see that both on that line, as well as if you go further back in the press release, the maintenance CapEx was also up about 20% for the quarter over prior year, also due to mild weather. Offsetting that in the R&M line was about $1.2 million, $1.3 million reduction in snow the. So you've got 2 different things going on there. Our best guess is that as the year goes on, the ongoing R&M will moderate. So that we hopefully, in the year flat to maybe slightly down year-over-year and realize some of the benefit from the snow removal.

Belgium was up 6.3%. Occupancy was up 0.5% to 86.5% for the quarter. Holland, which has been our weakest market for probably 1.5 years, NOI was down 5.5% and occupancy in that portfolio is at 76% versus 78% last year. Germany, NOI was up 22% and occupancy was down a point to 89%. France, occupancy was down to 84%, down 1.5%. NOI was flat. Sweden, NOI was down 4%, occupancy down 2.5%. Denmark, occupancy down 2.5% to 83% but NOI was up 10% and we did some changes in advertising. And then the U.K., our occupancy was up nicely to 86.8% for the quarter. That's up 3.8% over the last year and NOI was up about 2%. So it's a whole bunch of things going plus and minus across the continent. Overall, Europe's something. There's a lot of things going on in Europe and that's why our expectations are pretty modest for the year."

Last year's acquisition of affiliated partnership interest added $0.02. Lower financing cost added $0.02. And ancillary operations, primarily our tenant reinsurance business, added $0.01. 
In the press release, we changed some of our presentation. First, we increased the size of our same-store pools to include properties that we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For our U.S. same stores, we increased the pool by 10. For Shurgard Europe, the pool is increased by 13. We also modified our same-store expense classification to highlight other direct property costs, supervisory payroll and allocated overhead. Other self-storage companies may include some or all of these cost synergies in their G&A expenses. While we modified the presentation, we did not change what is included in our same-store expenses. 
We completed several capital transactions in 2012. We issued $923 million of preferred securities with a blended rate of 5.8%, and redeemed $833 million with an average rate of 6.7%. We had about $4 million of negative carry in the first quarter associated with these issuances. In addition, on July 2, we will redeem $173 million of our 7% Series and preferred stock. We expect to record an EITF charge of approximately $5.4 million in the second quarter. Assuming no further issuances, preferred dividends are expected to be about $7 million lower in the second quarter as compared to last year. Our weighted average preferred coupon is now 6.3%.

Our same-store movements were up 2% year-over-year, offset in part by higher move-outs of 5%. At the end of April, occupancy, in-place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year despite lower media spend for the period. In Q1, all of our markets achieved positive revenue growth. Dallas, Denver and Detroit markets led the country with revenue growth over 7%. Miami market was second at 6.3%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew 3.5%; and San Francisco, our second largest market, increased revenues 6% for the quarter. 
Given these positive trends in occupancies and rates, we expect our Q2 media spend will be comparable to last year. In Europe, same-store rental revenues were flat to last year, as higher realized rents were offset by lower occupancy. We did improve the year-over-year growth occupancy gap from 1.2% at the end of the year to 0.7% at the end of March. Operating expenses were lower, resulting in NOI growth of about 1%. We continue to expect a challenging operating environment in Europe for the remainder of the year.

That was up about $2.5 million. And you can see that both on that line, as well as if you go further back in the press release, the maintenance CapEx was also up about 20% for the quarter over prior year, also due to mild weather. Offsetting that in the R&M line was about $1.2 million, $1.3 million reduction in snow removal. So you've got 2 different things going on there. Our best guess is that as the year goes on, the ongoing R&M will moderate. So that we hopefully, in the year flat to maybe slightly down year-over-year and realize some of the benefit from the snow removal.

So with the technical termination of the partnerships, it resulted in a step up basis for property tax purposes and therefore, increased property taxes. That was built into the acquisition and the yield when we bought those interests but what you're seeing here is now, a $600,000 a quarter bump in property taxes just as a result of doing that transaction last year.

Denmark, occupancy down 2.5% to 83% but NOI was up 10% mainly due to changes in advertising. And then the U.K., our occupancy was up nicely to 86.8% for the quarter. That's up 3.8% over the last year and NOI was up about 2%. So it's a whole bunch of things going plus and minus across the continent. Overall, Europe's [indiscernible] and there's a lot of things going on in Europe and that's why our expectations are pretty modest for the year."

Last year's acquisition of affiliated partnership interest added $0.02. Lower financing cost added $0.02. And ancillary operations, primarily our tenant reinsurance business, added $0.01. 
In the press release, we changed some of our presentation. First, we increased the size of our same-store pools to include properties that we have operated for the last 3 years at a stabilized occupancy level. For our U.S. same stores, we increased the pool by 10. For Shurgard Europe, the pool is increased by 13. We also modified our same-store expense classification to highlight other direct property costs, supervisory payroll and allocated overhead. Other self-storage companies may include some or all of these cost synergies in their G&A expenses. While we modified the presentation, we did not change what is included in our same-store expenses. 
We completed several capital transactions in 2012. We issued $923 million of preferred securities with a blended rate of 5.8%, and redeemed $833 million with an average rate of 6.7%. We had about $4 million of negative carry in the first quarter associated with these issuances. In addition, on July 2, we will redeem $173 million of our 7% Series and preferred stock. We expect to record an EITF charge of approximately $5.4 million in the second quarter. Assuming no further issuances, preferred dividends are expected to be about $7 million lower in the second quarter as compared to last year. Our weighted average preferred coupon is now 6.3%.

Our same-store movements were up 2% year-over-year, offset in part by higher move-outs of 5%. At the end of April, occupancy, in-place rents and asking rents were all higher than the same period last year despite lower media spend for the period. In Q1, all of our markets achieved positive revenue growth. Dallas, Denver and Detroit markets led the country with revenue growth over 7%. The Miami market was second at 6.3%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew 3.5%; and San Francisco, our second-largest market, increased revenues 6% for the quarter. 
Given these positive trends in occupancies and rates, we expect our Q2 media spend will be comparable to last year. In Europe, same-store rental revenues were flat to last year, as higher realized rents were offset by lower occupancy. We did improve the year-over-year growth occupancy gap from 1.2% at the end of the year to 0.7% at the end of March. Operating expenses were lower, resulting in NOI growth of about 1%. We continue to expect a challenging operating environment in Europe for the remainder of the year.

You've got what I'll call ongoing R&M, the usual kind of painting, fixing gates. That kind of stuff. And we accelerated that in Q1. So that was up due to the mild weather. That was up about $2.5 million. And you can see that both on that line, as well as if you go further back in the press release, the maintenance CapEx was also up about 20% for the quarter over prior year, also due to mild weather. Offsetting that in the R&M line was about $1.2 million, $1.3 million reduction in snow removal. So you've got 2 different things going on there. Our best guess is that as the year goes on, the ongoing R&M will moderate. So that we hopefully, in the year flat to maybe slightly down year-over-year and realize some of the benefit from the snow removal. The supervisory payroll is higher headcount on DMs versus last year, as well as some state unemployment taxes. And then the allocated overhead is also slightly higher headcount. We expect the allocated overhead growth to moderate as we go through the balance of the year. Property taxes?"

So with the technical termination of the partnerships, it resulted in a step up basis for property tax purposes and therefore, increased property taxes.

Second quarter benefited from solid demand resulting in record high occupancies and higher realized rents. In Q2, we reduced media spend by 44% or about $1.5 million, as well as promotional discounts. 
Net customer acquisition cost declined as customer move-in volumes remained constant despite lower media and promotional discounts. At the end of July 2012, occupancy asking rents and in-place rents were all higher than the same period last year. 
In Q2, Denver and Charlotte markets led the country with revenue growth of 8.7% followed by Miami, Detroit at 6.6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew 4.4%, and San Francisco, our second largest market, grew -- revenues increased by 6.2%. 
Given the trends in our occupancies and rates, we expect our Q3 media spend will be comparable to last year. In Europe, same-store NOI improved 2% despite a challenging operating environment.

So you've seen some degradation in occupancy and an uptick in the in-place rents and the rental revenue, lower promotional discounts. That varies by market, and the operating results vary greatly by market on a revenue growth basis. France was down 1.6% on same-store basis whereas the U.K. was up 3.5%, and Belgium was up almost 7%.

I don't know the exact number, but the public companies contributed very, very small fraction of that. Most of it came from local people building 1 to 5 facilities, and those are the people that are well capital constrained at this time. Did that change going forward?

The second quarter benefited from solid demand, resulting in record-high occupancies and higher realized rents. In Q2, we reduced media spend by 44% or about $1.5 million, as well as promotional discounts. 
Net customer acquisition cost declined as customer move-in volumes remained constant despite lower media and promotional discounts. At the end of July 2012, occupancy, asking rents and in-place rents were all higher than the same period last year. 
In Q2, Denver and Charlotte markets led the country with revenue growth of 8.7%, followed by Miami and Detroit at 6.6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew 4.4%; and San Francisco, our second largest market, grew -- revenues increased by 6.2%. 
Given the trends in our occupancies and rates, we expect our Q3 media spend will be comparable to last year. In Europe, same-store NOI improved by 2% despite a challenging operating environment.

So we pay attention to that because that's really the base of customers that we have, that we target to send our rental rate increases. So it's important that, that group continue to grow. The second aspect of it is rental rate increases have a direct impact on people's length of stay, which is intuitively  a large call. If you send them a 3% rental rate increase, you're going to get a different move-out rate than if you send them a 30% rental rate increase. So we monitor that very carefully in terms of the level of rental rate increases we send out versus our change in move-out volume.

Certainly, the more well-capitalized regional operators have access to capital. And we've heard, we've seen a number of them talk about development some of them are starting. But the majority of the product, which comes in the 1Cs [ph] and 2Cs[ph], everything we know of those guys are still having a big challenge in terms of getting financing to undertake development. And if you think about development as a whole, and we may have covered this last time over the last 10, 12 years, there's probably been 15,000 facilities developed. I don't know the exact number, but the public companies contributed very, very small fraction of that. Most of it came from local people building 1 to 5 facilities. And those are the people that are pretty well capital constrained at that time -- at this time. Did that change going forward? It really depends on the banking industry. Does it make sense to build in some markets? Well, certainly in New York, if you could sell at $400 or $500 a foot. Can you build less than $400 or $500 a foot? Yes. So is it New York market, where it makes sense to build? I think so."

The second quarter benefited from solid demand, resulting in record-high occupancies and higher realized rents. In Q2, we reduced media spend by 44% or about $1.5 million, as well as promotional discounts. 
Net customer acquisition costs declined as customer move-in volumes remained constant despite lower media and promotional discounts. At the end of July 2012, occupancy, asking rents and in-place rents were all higher than the same period last year. 
In Q2, Denver and Charlotte markets led the country with revenue growth of 8.7%, followed by Miami and Detroit at 6.6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew 4.4%; and San Francisco, our second largest market, grew -- revenues increased by 6.2%. 
Given the trends in our occupancies and rates, we expect our Q3 media spend will be comparable to last year. In Europe, same-store NOI improved by 2% despite a challenging operating environment.

So again, the actual rate that's taken was about flat. In terms of the in-place rent, the in-place rent is still -- it fluctuates depending on the time of the year because we drive street rents, which can then go higher than in-place rents. And through that -- throughout the quarter, it was probably up about 5% on a year-over-year basis. But let me see if I can answer your question in a different way because it might be what you're really looking for. People were moving in at roughly $114 per unit on rent, but they were moving out at about $120 during the quarter. So net-net, we -- on just the pure rate alone, we were in a rent roll-down, which we were last year also. But I think that's really the question that you're trying to fish for."

At the end of Q2, June 30 it was about 54.9%, which is up from 54.7% in 2011 and up from 54% in 2010. So that number has been moving up year-over-year. It varies slightly by quarter due to seasonality. But quarter-over-quarter, it's continued to increase. So we pay attention to that because that's really the base of customers that we have, that we target to send out rental rate increases. So it's important that, that group continue to grow. The second aspect of it is rental rate increases have a direct impact on people's length of stay, which is intuitively logical. If you send them a 3% rental rate increase, you're going to get a different move-out rate than if you send them a 30% rental rate increase. So we monitor that very carefully in terms of the level of rental rate increases we send out versus our change in move-out volume. It's not directed so much to whether they're a business customer or a consumer. It's more how we're monitoring the rental rate increases than it's impact on our move-out volume.

These 70 facilities generated approximately $27 million in revenues during the third quarter. Within a few days, all of these facilities were open and operating. Damage to our facilities was minimal. We expect expenditures will be less than $1.5 million for repairs. 
With respect to third quarter earnings, our FFO, our core FFO per share was $1.76 compared to $1.56 last year, a 13% increase. This growth was primarily driven by a 7.9% increase in our same-store net operating income or $0.13 per share and lower preferred stock dividends of $0.05 per share. 
As announced yesterday, we will be redeeming on December 27, 3 series of our preferred securities totaling $363 million. As a result, we expect to record an EITF expense of approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter.

Our toughest market continues to be Holland where we're at 73% occupied at the end of the quarter, which is down 6.5% from last year. Despite very aggressive rental rate reductions and promotional discounts, we've been very challenged to get traction there in Holland. Most of the other markets are kind of chugging along. France is a little soft. Denmark we've got some tough year-over-year comps. It was a big flood up in Denmark. London is doing great.

The second thing is with respect to rental rate increases to existing customers and John can touch on that, but we've been running -- a lot of our growth comes from that and I think it's been 3.5%, 4% of our growth comes from those. And then the third factor that's been probably bigger impact in 2012 versus last 3 or 4 years is promotional discounts, which we've been able to modulate down, especially during the second and third quarter due to our high occupancy. So going into 2013, if we're able to sustain the higher level of occupancies, we hope to be able to modulate further down the promotional discounts.

As announced yesterday, we will be redeeming, on December 27, 3 series of our preferred securities totaling $363 million. As a result, we expect to record an EITF expense of approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

At the end of October, occupancy and in-place rents were higher than last year. The Charlotte and Denver markets led the country with revenue growth of 8% followed by Houston and Miami with about 6%. Los Angeles, our largest market, grew by 4.4%. And San Francisco, our second largest market, increased by about 5.5%. In Europe, same-store NOI improved 2% despite a challenging operating environment. 
We recently acquired 8 facilities and have 2 others under contract. Total 2012 acquisition volume for third parties will be just over $200 million.

So we've been able to hold it in terms of the revenue line pretty well and then been pretty aggressive on cost management. So overall, it's a positive NOI year, which, quite frankly, is surprising. Our toughest market continues to be Holland where we're at 73% occupied at the end of the quarter, which is down 6.5% from last year. Despite very aggressive rental rate reductions and promotional discounts, we've been very challenged to get traction there in Holland. Most of the other markets are kind of chugging along. France is a little soft. Denmark, we've got some tough year-over-year comps. There was a big flood up in Denmark. London's doing great.

And then the third factor that's been a -- probably a bigger impact in 2012 versus last 3 or 4 years is promotional discounts, which we've been able to modulate down, especially during the second and third quarter due to our high occupancy.
