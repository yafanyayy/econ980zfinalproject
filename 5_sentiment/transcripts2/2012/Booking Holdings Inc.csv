I will make some opening remarks and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated growth bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $5 billion, up 52% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $276.8 million or $5.37 per share, up 58% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $5.05 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $33.6 million for the quarter, up 53% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $21.7 billion, up 59% from 2010 and non-GAAP net income per share of $23.45, a 74% increase over 2010.
Growth rates for our International business increased slightly on a local currency basis during the quarter with 67% growth bookings growth. International gross bookings growth rates benefited from increased ADRs, growth in new markets and growth in hotel supply.
Booking.com continue to build its worldwide hotel supply platform with now approximately 195,000 hotels and other accommodations in 160 countries. Booking.com has maintained an impressive rate of new property acquisition. Keep in mind, however, that many new properties, especially in highly penetrated markets, are smaller, have fewer rooms and potentially lower ADRs and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers, for example hostels and bed and breakfast and, therefore, may generate less commission revenue over time.
Booking.com's focused on new markets into Asia, South America and North America continues with reservations to those destinations growing faster than core markets and increasing as a share of total reservations. Booking.com is also making substantial investment in people to promote and manage the expansion of its hotel and geographic base. 
While the high growth rates in new markets are encouraging, we believe Booking.com still has a substantial opportunity to grow in its core markets. A recent study published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, reported 1.6 billion room nights stayed in 2011 in the 27 EU countries. Priceline's group-wide room nights booked in the EU 27 in 2011 represents a mid-single-digit percentage of that total, although our share may be higher or lower in a given destination.
Priceline's domestic growth bookings grew 16% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of retail home room night reservations, retail rental car reservations and growth in airline ticket sales and average ticket prices. Hotel room night booking growth also benefited from higher ADRs. Priceline's opaque hotel service continues to be impacted by the increase in competitive discount offerings in the market.
Merchant growth bookings growth of 37% primarily reflects growth in the merchant businesses of Agoda and rentalcars.com.com, formerly TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. These results were delivered despite the negative impact of the floods in Thailand, which cost the loss of some reservations and higher cancellations. We are grateful for the team's efforts in dealing with the effect of the floods and continuing to move the business forward.
In 2011, rentalcars.com.com substantially completed the transition of its business from a number of brands under TravelJigsaw such as Car Higher 3000 to rentalcars.com.com. For many years, the group has operated a retail offering in the United States with the rentalcars.com.com URL. We believe rentalcars.com is one of the leading domain names for online rental car reservations. And the team is delighted to consolidate the U.S. retail business with TravelJigsaw's International business and drive investments to build the rentalcars.com brand worldwide.
We are very pleased with the growth of our brands in 2011 and with the progress each made in building its franchise for the future. As we have stated in previous calls, we expect growth rates to decelerate due to the large scales of the business we operate. We are also cautious in view of continued challenging economic conditions, particularly in Southern Europe where we believe austerity programs and recessionary conditions have had a negative effect on growth rates. Our aim is to continue building our strength in new markets, gain share in core markets and pursue innovation, which we believe will allow us to build on our leadership position as the markets change.
In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for a detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Growth rate mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q4 was a strong quarter from a top line growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 52%, driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 53% in the fourth quarter, representing sequential acceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q3. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q4 2011.
FX rates for the fourth quarter for the euro and British pound were each about 2% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance, and about 1% unfavorable compared to the prior year. Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by 65.5%, and by 67% on a local currency basis. In both cases, exceeding the top end of our guidance range.
The guidance we gave on November 7 was based upon actual results through that date. And as we said on the call, the assumption that growth rates with decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter.
Hotel room night growth rates for our International business instead accelerated through the remainder of the quarter. And as we'll see in a moment when we discuss guidance, these bookings are expected to contribute to gross profit growth in Q1 upon checkout. 
Performance was generally strong across all regions, with newer markets for Booking.com, mainly North America, Asia Pacific and South America growing well in excess of our consolidated growth rate. But we do see softer growth rates in ADR transfer for southern European countries.
Rentalcars.com days booked grew by 34%, driven mainly by strong growth to our rentalcars.com.com business. The rentalcars.com team have done a good job of transitioning the brand bed and building the infrastructure. The business delivered results in 2011 that exceeded our expectations is off to a good start in 2012. Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 16% exceeded our forecast for 13% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth.
Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 6% in the quarter, reflecting good growth in the retail airline tickets, partly offset by a modest decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets to the limited availability to discounted tickets resulting from further capacity flux by the airline industry.
An 11% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. U.S. rental car business had a good quarter, helped by strong retail bookings and availability of discounted rates for its opaque business. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit for the quarter was $725 million and grew 51% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $609 million, which constituted an increase of 63% as compared to the prior year, net increase of 66% on the local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $116 million, which represented 10% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.5% for Q4 2011 as compared to 46.1% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit resulting in 40 bps of additional operating leverage. However, airline advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 220 bps higher than prior year, primarily as a result of business mix. 
Our International business, which relies more on airline advertising spend, grew at a faster base that our U.S. business driving the mixed impact. In addition, our price on U.S. business continues to see an increasing share of its business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $344 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $330 million and represents 54% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 58% including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate through the Innovation Box tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $282 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter 2011, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $17 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $47 million on a full year basis, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion, including the office facilities for Booking.com in Amsterdam and the U.K. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $2.1 billion. We also have a $1 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn and does not expire until 2016.
Now for first quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 33% to 38%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 41% to 46% as compared to last year, and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 43% to 48%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q1 will be flat to up slightly for International Hotel service and up by about 5% to 6% for our U.S. hotel service. 
Our Q1 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.34 per euro and $1.59 for British pound this Friday's closing rates, which will result in average exchange rate that would be weaker by 3% for the euro and by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. Although euro had increased in valuations in U.S. dollar recently, it is important to remember that given challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro dollar exchange rate, which could materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and then of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter.
We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 22% to 27% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 40% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at a slower pace than gross profit, mainly due to deleveraged online advertising expense, where we expect to continue to see trend of our business mix shifting to international and online paid channels. In addition, we assume that Q1 margins will be impacted by our continued investment in people, offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense related to CapEx to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $243 million and $253 million, which at the midpoint, represents 43% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $3.80 to $3.90 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 45% growth over the prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimate of cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and the alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our GAAP EPS guidance -- our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based on Friday's closing stock price of $590.41. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are reconciled in detail in our earnings release.
Our guidance reflects the growth rate deceleration observed in our actual results to date and assumes continued deceleration through the remainder of the quarter. We believe that the gross bookings growth rates inherent in our Q1 guidance are likely impacted by a challenging comparable quarter for Q1 2011 in which we experienced exhilaration in growth rates as compared to Q4 2010. Our Q1 2012 growth rate has also likely been impacted by extreme weather across Europe and the impact of weak economic conditions in sovereign debt concerns in Europe.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we have seen short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for International business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends. 
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rate and ADR transfer for certain southern European countries likely due to economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If these prompts were to intensify, our spread to other key markets, our business would be adversely impacted. 
I want to take a moment to comment on a few industry and market factors as elected a balance of 2012. A number of our competitors have experienced substantial margin compression as part of a program of investment to position their businesses for growth. On the other hand, our group has seen improvement in operating leverage over the past several years. 
While we do not currently foresee substantial margin from associated with large IT platform rebuilds and the like, there are factors that could put pressure on margins going forward, including continued growth in the mix of paid online business, decreases in marketing ROI tied to costs, pressure on unit economics or conversion rates, high growth in markets like Asia, which are at an early stage of development and have lower operating margin's compared to more mature markets, and continued investment in geographic expansion and hotel additions, which may, as Jeff just discussed, provide diminishing results over time. 
We also continued to be generally cautious on our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. We will now take your questions."

If you look at how long both Agoda and Booking.com have been in the APAC market, the relative market share that both brands have, the massive size of that market, especially when you take into consideration China and Japan, which have very, very low penetration of multinational online travel agents selling in market. We have to look at that as a multiyear opportunity. We view that as good news because it means we have -- if we can execute a long period of growth to look forward to. And keep in mind that we've been investing in those markets for years, and we're able to do so, I think we're still having a respectable margin situation. Put another way, we make money in APAC. We're not deficit spending. It's just that the margins in that market are not as high. The operating margins as they are in other markets were we've been in operating for a longer time. With respect to rentalcars.com, we're excited about the opportunity for rentalcars.com, but we are mindful of the fact that the rental car market internationally is a much smaller market than the hotel market. And therefore, the opportunity to grow and to grow, to be a material size to the group is something that's going to take longer. While there is some cross sell that we do take advantage of, we will concede take advantage of, rentalcars.com.com is going to have to be successful, completely independent of that because the cross sell opportunities are not going to be enough to really build that into a giant business by themselves. And so that's one of the reasons we're excited about the rebranding because we think under one URL, our URL is as good as rentalcars.com. We've got a real shot of building a very strong international brand that can stand on its own."

If you look at Booking.com's business in a lot of these new markets, it's driven in the first instance by the very substantial pool of international travelers that Booking can access because of its network around the world. So the entrance into these markets is often driven by the international traveler. And as Booking.com is able to build up significant inventory and significant content in local languages, the domestic traveler comes next. It wouldn't be surprising in the domestic traveler was initially more interested in international destinations because Booking.com has the best international inventory. But over time, our hope is that Booking.com is able to drive a significant purely in country business, and that certainly have happened in Western Europe. With respect to Asia in particular, relatively speaking, Agoda is really driven by the Asian traveler and Booking.com is more driven by the international traveler."

But certainly, something that takes the big bite out of discretionary spending available for travelers is not a positive factor for our business. So if fuel prices go higher or is the elevated for a long period of time, that's a negative factor but hasn't had a negative impact to date. In terms of pricing it by segment or travel, the high-yield fewer prices typically drive even higher airline ticket prices. We've already seen that over the last several quarters, even without the dramatically higher fuel prices. So we've already been contending with that. Higher ticket prices, also make it harder for leisure travelers to be able to afford the travel, and that's not helpful. But since our business the predominantly hotel centric, to the extent that they still travel by car or train or shorter flight, we would hope to have the ability to tap into that booking."

Our business, the International business in particular, peaks in the summer. And with the growth rates we've been experiencing, it's important to hire up customer service associates to handle that business. And in addition, as we've been expanding geographically and building the hotel inventory, we need to hire people to be out in the regions visiting the hotels and making sure we have them signed up in the first instance and rates and availability on an ongoing basis. All of those people get productive very, very quickly. But there's an element of variability to it, because we need more of them as the business grows and as the hotel inventory grows. So I think that's the way to look at that. We may have relatively more or relatively fewer than we actually needed at any given point in time, and that can drive a little positive or negative leverage. And if you look at our conference calls over the past couple of years, you can see some leverage about that. But I don't think those variances are material to the long-term profitability of the model. With respect to CPCs in Europe and your question about where the investment goes, our investment is way, way emphasized on paid channels. So if you look at what we're spending in online marketing, that's paid marketing, it doesn't represent a massive amount of spend on people working on optimization for search engines and other channels.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $5 billion, up 52% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $276.8 million or $5.37 per share, up 58% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $5.05 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $33.6 million for the quarter, up 53% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $21.7 billion, up 59% from 2010 and non-GAAP net income per share of $23.45, a 74% increase over 2010.
Growth rates for our international business increased slightly on a local currency basis during the quarter, with 67% gross bookings growth. International gross bookings growth rates benefited from increased ADRs, growth in new markets and growth in hotel supply.
Booking.com continue to build its worldwide hotel supply platform, with now approximately 195,000 hotels and other accommodations in 160 countries. Booking.com has maintained an impressive rate of new property acquisition. Keep in mind, however, that many new properties, especially in highly penetrated markets, are smaller, have fewer rooms and potentially lower ADRs and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers, for example, hostels and bed and breakfasts, and therefore may generate less commission revenue over time.
Booking.com's focus on new markets into Asia, South America and North America continues, with reservations to those destinations growing faster than core markets and increasing as a share of total reservations. Booking.com is also making substantial investment in people to promote and manage the expansion of its hotel and geographic base. While high growth rates in new markets are encouraging, we believe Booking.com still has a substantial opportunity to grow in its core markets. 
A recent study published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, reported 1.6 billion room night stayed in 2011 in the 27 EU countries. Priceline's group-wide room nights booked in the EU 27 in 2011 represents a mid-single-digit percentage of that total, although our share may be higher or lower in a given destination.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 16% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of retail hotel room night reservations, retail rental car reservations and growth in airline ticket sales and average ticket prices. Hotel room night booking growth also benefited from higher ADRs. Priceline's opaque hotel service continue to be impacted by the increase in competitive discount offerings in the market.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 37% primarily reflects growth in the merchant businesses of Agoda and rentalcars.com, formerly TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. These results were delivered despite the negative impact of the floods in Thailand, which caused the loss of some reservations and higher cancellations. We are grateful for the team's efforts in dealing with the effect of the floods and continuing to move the business forward.
In 2011, rentalcars.com substantially completed the transition of its business from a number of brands under TravelJigsaw, such as Carhire3000, to rentalcars.com. For many years, the group has operated a retail offering in the United States with the rentalcars.com URL. We believe rentalcars.com is one of the leading domain names for online rental car reservations, and the team is delighted to consolidate the U.S. retail business with TravelJigsaw's international business and drive investment to build the rentalcars.com brand worldwide.
We are very pleased with the growth of our brands in 2011 and with the progress each made in building its franchise for the future. As we have stated in previous calls, we expect growth rates to decelerate due to the large scale of the business we operate. We are also cautious in view of continued challenging economic conditions, particularly in Southern Europe where we believe austerity programs and recessionary conditions have had a negative effect on growth rates. Our aim is to continue building our strength in new markets, gain share in core markets and pursue innovation, which we believe will allow us to build on our leadership position as the markets change.
In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q4 was a strong quarter from a top line growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 52%, driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 53% in the fourth quarter, representing sequential acceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q3. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q4 2011.
FX rates for the fourth quarter for the euro and British pound were each about 2% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance and about 1% unfavorable compared to the prior year. Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by 65.5% and by 67% on a local currency basis, in both cases, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. 
The guidance we gave on November 7 was based upon actual results through that date and, as we said on the call, that assumption that growth rates would decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Hotel room night growth rates for our international business instead accelerated through the remainder of the quarter. And as we'll see in a moment when we discuss guidance, these bookings are expected to contribute to gross profit growth in Q1 upon checkout. 
Performance was generally strong across all regions, with newer markets for Booking.com, mainly North America, Asia Pacific and South America growing well in excess of our consolidated growth rate. But we do see softer growth rates in ADR trends for certain Southern European countries.
Rental cars days booked were up by 34%, driven mainly by strong growth for our rentalcars.com business. The rentalcars.com team has done a good job of transitioning the brand and building their infrastructure. The business delivered results in 2011 that exceeded our expectations and is off to a good start in 2012. 
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 16% exceeded our forecast for 13% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. 
Airline tickets booked were up by 6% in the quarter, reflecting good growth in the retail airline tickets, partly offset by a modest decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited availability to discounted tickets, resulting from further capacity flux by the airline industry. An 11% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth. 
U.S. rental car business had a good quarter, helped by strong retail bookings and availability of discounted rates for its opaque business. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit for the quarter was $725 million and grew 51% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $609 million, which constituted an increase of 63% as compared to the prior year net increase of 66% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $116 million, which represented 10% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.5% for Q4 2011 as compared to 46.1% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 40 bps of additional operating leverage. However, online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 220 bps higher than prior year, primarily as a result of business mix. 
Our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. business, driving the mixed impact. In addition, our price on U.S. business continues to see an increase in share of its business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $344 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $330 million, and represents 54% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 58%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $282 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter 2011, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $17 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $47 million on a full year basis, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, including new office facilities for Booking.com in Amsterdam and the U.K. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $2.1 billion. We also have a $1 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn and does not expire until 2016.
Now for first quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 33% to 38%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 41% to 46% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 43% to 48%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q1 will be flat to up slightly for our international hotel service and up by about 5% to 6% for our U.S. hotel service. 
Our Q1 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.34 per euro and $1.59 for British pound this Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 3% for the euro and by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. Although euro has increased in value versus the U.S. dollar recently, it is important to remember that, given challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. 
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and then of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter.
We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 22% to 27% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 40% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at a slower pace than gross profit, mainly due to deleveraged online advertising expense, where we expect to continue to see a trend of our business mix shifting to international and online paid channels. In addition, we assume that Q1 margins will be impacted by our continued investment in people, offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense related to CapEx to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $243 million and $253 million, which at the midpoint represents 43% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $3.80 to $3.90 per share, which at the midpoint represents 45% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and the alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our GAAP EPS guidance -- our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $590.41. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are reconciled in detail in our earnings release.
Our guidance reflects the growth rate deceleration observed in our actual results to date and assumes continued deceleration through the remainder of the quarter. We believe that the gross bookings growth rates inherent in our Q1 guidance are likely impacted by a challenging comparable quarter for Q1 2011 in which we experienced exhilaration in growth rates as compared to Q4 2010. Our Q1 2012 growth rate has also likely been impacted by extreme weather across Europe and the impact of weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns in Europe.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we have seen short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for International business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends. 
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rate and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries likely due to economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If these problems were to intensify or spread to other key markets, our business would be adversely impacted. 
I want to take a moment to comment on a few industry and market factors as we look to the balance of 2012. A number of our competitors have experienced substantial margin compression as part of a program of investment to position their businesses for growth. On the other hand, our group has seen improvement in operating leverage over the past several years. 
While we do not currently foresee substantial margin compression associated with large IT platform rebuilds and the like, there are factors that could put pressure on margins going forward, including continued growth in the mix of paid online business; decreases in marketing ROIs tied to click costs, pressure on unit economics or conversion rates; high growth in markets like Asia, which are at an earlier stage of development and have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets; and continued investment in geographic expansion and hotel additions, which may, as Jeff just discussed, provide diminishing returns over time. 
We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. 
We will now take your questions."

Do you feel like you're half way through that kind of marketing investment cycle or core? Is there any way you could do to quantify that? I mean, could you also talk broadly about the rental cars business going forward and how if there's a way you think about how big that could be to Priceline over the year next 3- to 5-year time horizon to the extent to which you think it's an easy cross-sell or it's a completely separately run business?"

If you look at how long both Agoda and Booking.com have been in the APAC market, the relative market share that both brands have, the massive size of that market, especially when you take into consideration China and Japan, which have very, very low penetration of multinational online travel agents selling in market. We have to look at that as a multi-year opportunity. We view that is as good news because it means we have -- if we can execute a long period of growth to look forward to and keep in mind that we've been investing in those markets for years. And we're able to do so, I think, with still having a respectable margin situation. Put another way, we make money in APAC. We're not deficit spending. It's just that the margins in that market are not as high the operating margins as they are in other markets where we've been and operating for a longer time. With respect to rentalcars.com, we're excited about the opportunity for rentalcars.com, but we are mindful of the fact that the rental car market internationally is a much smaller market than the hotel market. And therefore, the opportunity to grow and to grow, to be of a material size to the group is something that's going to take longer. While there is some cross-sell that we do take advantage of and we'll continue to take advantage of, rentalcars.com is going to have to be successful, completely independent of that, because the cross-sell opportunities are not going to be enough to really build that into a giant business by themselves. And so that's one of the reasons we're excited about the re-branding because we think under one URL, a URL as good as rentalcars.com, we've got a real shot at building a very strong international brand that can stand on its own."

So the entrance into these markets is often driven by the international traveler. And as Booking.com is able to build up significant inventory and significant content in local languages, the domestic traveler comes next. It wouldn't be surprising if the domestic traveler was initially more interested in international destinations because Booking.com has the best international inventory. But over time, our hope is that Booking.com is able to drive a significant purely in-country business, and that certainly has happened in Western Europe. With respect to Asia in particular, relatively speaking, Agoda is more driven by the Asian traveler, and Booking.com is more driven by the international traveler."

We think the Q4 results are strong, and the Q1 guidance is positive as well. But certainly, something that takes a big bite out of discretionary spending available for travelers is not a positive factor for our business. So if fuel prices go higher or stay elevated for a prolonged period of time, that's a negative factor. But it hasn't had a negative impact to-date. In terms of parsing it by segment or travel, I mean, the higher fuel prices typically drive even higher airline ticket prices. We've already seen that over the last several quarters even without the dramatically higher fuel prices. So we've already been contending with that. Higher ticket prices also make it harder for leisure travelers to be able to afford the travel, and that's not helpful. But since our business is predominantly hotel-centric, to the extent that they still travel by car or train or shorter flight, we would hope to have the ability to tap into that booking."

Our business, the international business in particular, peaks in the summer. And with the growth rates we've been experiencing, it's important to hire up customer service associates to handle that business. And in addition, as we've been expanding geographically and building the hotel inventory, we need to hire people to be out in the regions visiting the hotels and making sure we have them signed up in the first instance and rates and availability on an ongoing basis. All of those people get productive very, very quickly. But there's an element of variability to it because we need more of them as the business grows and as the hotel inventory grows. So I think that's the way to look at that. We may have relatively more or relatively fewer than we actually need at any given point in time, and that can drive a little positive or negative leverage. And if you look at our conference calls over the past couple of years, you can see some verbiage about that. But I don't think those variances are material to the long-term profitability of the model. With respect to CPCs in Europe and your question about where the investment goes, our investment is way, way emphasized on paid channels. So if you look at what we're spending in online marketing, that's paid marketing.

P",766,"Thank you very much, and welcome to Priceline's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm here with Priceline CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions. Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $5 billion, up 52% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $276.8 million or $5.37 per share, up 58% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $5.05 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $33.6 million for the quarter, up 53% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $21.7 billion, up 59% from 2010 and non-GAAP net income per share of $23.45, a 74% increase over 2010.
Growth rates for our international business increased slightly on a local currency basis during the quarter, with 67% gross bookings growth. International gross bookings growth rates benefited from increased ADRs, growth in new markets and growth in hotel supply.
Booking.com continued to build its worldwide hotel supply platform, with now approximately 195,000 hotels and other accommodations in 160 countries. Booking.com has maintained an impressive rate of new property acquisition. Keep in mind, however, that many new properties, especially in highly penetrated markets, are smaller, have fewer rooms and potentially lower ADRs and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers, for example, hostels and bed and breakfasts, and therefore may generate less commission revenue over time.
Booking.com's focus on new markets in Asia, South America and North America continues, with reservations to those destinations growing faster than core markets and increasing as a share of total reservations. Booking.com is also making substantial investment in people to promote and manage the expansion of its hotel and geographic base. While high growth rates in new markets are encouraging, we believe Booking.com still has a substantial opportunity to grow in its core markets. A recent study published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, reported 1.6 billion room nights stayed in 2011 in the 27 EU countries. Priceline's group-wide room nights booked in the EU 27 in 2011 represents a mid-single-digit percentage of that total, although our share may be higher or lower in a given destination.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 16% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of retail hotel room night reservations, retail rental car reservations and growth in airline ticket sales and average ticket prices. Hotel room night booking growth also benefited from higher ADRs. Priceline's opaque hotel service continued to be impacted by the increase in competitive discount offerings in the market.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 37% primarily reflects growth in the merchant businesses of Agoda and rentalcars.com, formerly TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. These results were delivered despite the negative impact of the floods in Thailand, which caused the loss of some reservations and higher cancellations. We are grateful for the team's efforts in dealing with the effect of the floods and continuing to move the business forward.
In 2011, rentalcars.com substantially completed the transition of its business from a number of brands under TravelJigsaw, such as Carhire3000, to rentalcars.com. For many years, the group has operated a retail offering in the United States with the rentalcars.com URL. We believe rentalcars.com is one of the leading domain names for online rental car reservations, and the team is delighted to consolidate the U.S. retail business with TravelJigsaw's international business and drive investment to build the rentalcars.com brand worldwide.
We are very pleased with the growth of our brands in 2011 and with the progress each made in building its franchise for the future. As we have stated in previous calls, we expect growth rates to decelerate due to the large scale of the business we operate. We are also cautious in view of continued challenging economic conditions, particularly in Southern Europe where we believe austerity programs and recessionary conditions have had a negative effect on growth rates. Our aim is to continue building our strength in new markets, gain share in core markets and pursue innovation, which we believe will allow us to build on our leadership position as the markets change.
In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q4 was a strong quarter from a top line growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 52%, driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 53% in the fourth quarter, representing sequential acceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q3. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q4 2011.
FX rates for the fourth quarter for the euro and British pound were each about 2% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance and about 1% unfavorable compared to the prior year. Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by 65.5% and by 67% on a local currency basis, in both cases, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The guidance we gave on November 7 was based upon actual results through that date and, as we said on the call, the assumption that growth rates would decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Hotel room night growth rates for our international business instead accelerated through the remainder of the quarter. And as we'll see in a moment when we discuss guidance, these bookings are expected to contribute to gross profit growth in Q1 upon checkout.
Performance was generally strong across all regions, with newer markets for Booking.com, namely North America, Asia Pacific and South America growing well in excess of our consolidated growth rate. But we do see softer growth rates in ADR trends for certain Southern European countries.
Rental car days booked were up by 34%, driven mainly by strong growth for our rentalcars.com business. The rentalcars.com team has done a good job of transitioning the brand and building their infrastructure. The business delivered results in 2011 that exceeded our expectations and is off to a good start in 2012.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 16% exceeded our forecast for 13% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 6% in the quarter, reflecting good growth in the retail airline tickets, partly offset by a modest decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited availability to discounted tickets, resulting from further capacity flux by the airline industry. An 11% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth.
U.S. rental car business had a good quarter, helped by strong retail bookings and availability of discounted rates for its opaque business. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit for the quarter was $725 million and grew 51% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $609 million, which constituted an increase of 63% as compared to the prior year, an increase of 66% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $116 million, which represented 10% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.5% for Q4 2011 as compared to 46.1% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 40 bps of additional operating leverage. However, online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 220 bps higher than prior year, primarily as a result of business mix. Our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. business, driving the mixed impact. In addition, our price on U.S. business continues to see an increase in share of its business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $344 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $330 million, and represents 54% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 58%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $282 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter 2011, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $17 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $47 million on a full year basis, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, including new office facilities for Booking.com in Amsterdam and the U.K. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $2.1 billion. We also have a $1 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn and does not expire until 2016.
Now for first quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 33% to 38%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 41% to 46% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 43% to 48%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q1 will be flat to up slightly for our international hotel service and up by about 5% to 6% for our U.S. hotel service. Our Q1 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.34 per euro and $1.59 per British pound as Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 3% for the euro and by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. Although euro has increased in value versus the U.S. dollar recently, it is important to remember that, given challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter.
We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 22% to 27% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 40% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at a slower pace than gross profit, mainly due to deleveraged and online advertising expense, where we expect to continue to see a trend of our business mix shifting to international and online paid channels. In addition, we assume that Q1 margins will be impacted by our continued investment in people, offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense related to CapEx to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $243 million and $253 million, which at the midpoint represents 43% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $3.80 to $3.90 per share, which at the midpoint represents 45% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and the alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our GAAP EPS guidance -- our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $590.41. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are reconciled in detail in our earnings release.
Our guidance reflects the growth rate deceleration observed in our actual results to date and assumes continued deceleration through the remainder of the quarter. We believe that the gross bookings growth rates inherent in our Q1 guidance are likely impacted by a challenging comparable quarter for Q1 2011 in which we experienced exhilaration in growth rates as compared to Q4 2010. Our Q1 2012 growth rate has also likely been impacted by extreme weather across Europe and the impact of weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns in Europe.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we have seen short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for our International business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rate and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries, likely due to economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If these problems were to intensify or spread to other key markets, our business would be adversely impacted.
I want to take a moment to comment on a few industry and market factors as we look to the balance of 2012. A number of our competitors have experienced substantial margin compression as part of a program of investment to position their businesses for growth. On the other hand, our group has seen improvement in operating leverage over the past several years. While we do not currently foresee substantial margin compression associated with large IT platform rebuilds and the like, there are factors that could put pressure on margins going forward, including continued growth in the mix of paid online business; decreases in marketing ROIs tied to click costs, pressure on unit economics or conversion rates; high growth in markets like Asia, which are at an earlier stage of development and have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets; and continued investment in geographic expansion and hotel additions, which may, as Jeff just discussed, provide diminishing returns over time. We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

But our research with consumers has shown us over the years that there still are a very large number of U.S. consumers that don't even really know that priceline.com offers a full retail hotel product. And having made the investment to build that inventory to be one of the largest inventories available and many more choices for consumers, we thought it was important to underline that at this point in time."

If you look at how long both Agoda and Booking.com have been in the APAC market, the relative market share that both brands have, the massive size of that market, especially when you take into consideration China and Japan, which have very, very low penetration of multinational online travel agents selling in market. We have to look at that as a multi-year opportunity. We view that is as good news because it means we have -- if we can execute a long period of growth to look forward to and keep in mind that we've been investing in those markets for years. And we're able to do so, I think, with still having a respectable margin situation. Put another way, we make money in APAC. We're not deficit spending. It's just that the margins in that market are not as high, the operating margins, as they are in other markets where we've been in operating for a longer time. With respect to rentalcars.com, we're excited about the opportunity for rentalcars.com, but we are mindful of the fact that the rental car market internationally is a much smaller market than the hotel market. And therefore, the opportunity to grow and to grow to be of a material size to the group is something that's going to take longer. While there is some cross-sell that we do take advantage of and we'll continue to take advantage of, rentalcars.com is going to have to be successful, completely independent of that, because the cross-sell opportunities are not going to be enough to really build that into a giant business by themselves. And so that's one of the reasons we're excited about the re-branding because we think under one URL, a URL as good as rentalcars.com, you've got a real shot at building a very strong international brand that can stand on its own."

It wouldn't be surprising if the domestic traveler was initially more interested in international destinations because Booking.com has the best international inventory.

We think the Q4 results are strong, and the Q1 guidance is positive as well. But certainly, something that takes a big bite out of discretionary spending available for travelers is not a positive factor for our business. So if fuel prices go higher or stay elevated for a prolonged period of time, that's a negative factor. But it hasn't had a negative impact to-date. In terms of parsing it by segment or travel, I mean, the higher fuel prices typically drive even higher airline ticket prices. We've already seen that over the last several quarters even without the dramatically higher fuel prices. So we've already been contending with that. Higher ticket prices also make it harder for leisure travelers to be able to afford the travel, and that's not helpful. But since our business is predominantly hotel-centric, to the extent that they still travel by car or train or shorter flight, we would hope to have the ability to tap into that booking."

Our business, the international business in particular, peaks in the summer. And with the growth rates we've been experiencing, it's important to hire up customer service associates to handle that business. And in addition, as we've been expanding geographically and building the hotel inventory, we need to hire people to be out in the regions visiting the hotels and making sure we have them signed up in the first instance and rates and availability on an ongoing basis. All of those people get productive very, very quickly. But there's an element of variability to it because we need more of them as the business grows and as the hotel inventory grows. So I think that's the way to look at that. We may have relatively more or relatively fewer than we actually need at any given point in time, and that can drive a little positive or negative leverage. And if you look at our conference calls over the past couple of years, you can see some verbiage about that. But I don't think those variances are material to the long-term profitability of the model. With respect to CPCs in Europe and your question about where the investment goes, our investment is way, way emphasized on paid channels. So if you look at what we're spending in online marketing, that's paid marketing. It doesn't represent a massive amount of spend on people working on optimization for search engines and other channels.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions. Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $5 billion, up 52% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $276.8 million or $5.37 per share, up 58% versus prior year. Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $5.05 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $33.6 million for the quarter, up 53% year-over-year. For the full year, Priceline reported gross bookings of $21.7 billion, up 59% from 2010 and non-GAAP net income per share of $23.45, a 74% increase over 2010.
Growth rates for our international business increased slightly on a local currency basis during the quarter, with 67% gross bookings growth. International gross bookings growth rates benefited from increased ADRs, growth in new markets and growth in hotel supply.
Booking.com continued to build its worldwide hotel supply platform, with now approximately 195,000 hotels and other accommodations in 160 countries. Booking.com has maintained an impressive rate of new property acquisition. Keep in mind, however, that many new properties, especially in highly penetrated markets, are smaller, have fewer rooms and potentially lower ADRs and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers, for example, hostels and bed and breakfasts, and therefore may generate less commission revenue over time.
Booking.com's focus on new markets in Asia, South America and North America continues, with reservations to those destinations growing faster than core markets and increasing as a share of total reservations. Booking.com is also making substantial investment in people to promote and manage the expansion of its hotel and geographic base. While high growth rates in new markets are encouraging, we believe Booking.com still has a substantial opportunity to grow in its core markets. A recent study published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, reported 1.6 billion room nights stayed in 2011 in the 27 EU countries. Priceline's group-wide room nights booked in the EU 27 in 2011 represents a mid-single-digit percentage of that total, although our share may be higher or lower in a given destination.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 16% in the fourth quarter due primarily to growth in sales of retail hotel room night reservations, retail rental car reservations and growth in airline ticket sales and average ticket prices. Hotel room night booking growth also benefited from higher ADRs. Priceline's opaque hotel service continued to be impacted by the increase in competitive discount offerings in the market.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 37% primarily reflects growth in the merchant businesses of Agoda and rentalcars.com, formerly TravelJigsaw. Agoda continues to build its business in the Asian region and continues to report impressive year-over-year growth in gross bookings, contributing to the overall international and merchant growth we are reporting. These results were delivered despite the negative impact of the floods in Thailand, which caused the loss of some reservations and higher cancellations. We are grateful for the team's efforts in dealing with the effect of the floods and continuing to move the business forward.
In 2011, rentalcars.com substantially completed the transition of its business from a number of brands under TravelJigsaw, such as Carhire3000, to rentalcars.com. For many years, the group has operated a retail offering in the United States with the rentalcars.com URL. We believe rentalcars.com is one of the leading domain names for online rental car reservations, and the team is delighted to consolidate the U.S. retail business with TravelJigsaw's international business and drive investment to build the rentalcars.com brand worldwide.
We are very pleased with the growth of our brands in 2011 and with the progress each made in building its franchise for the future. As we have stated in previous calls, we expect growth rates to decelerate due to the large scale of the business we operate. We are also cautious in view of continued challenging economic conditions, particularly in Southern Europe where we believe austerity programs and recessionary conditions have had a negative effect on growth rates. Our aim is to continue building our strength in new markets, gain share in core markets and pursue innovation, which we believe will allow us to build on our leadership position as the markets change.
In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter, and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q4 was a strong quarter from a top line growth perspective. Gross bookings grew by 52%, driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 53% in the fourth quarter, representing sequential acceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q3. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service for Q4 2011.
FX rates for the fourth quarter for the euro and British pound were each about 2% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance and about 1% unfavorable compared to the prior year. Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by 65.5% and by 67% on a local currency basis, in both cases, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The guidance we gave on November 7 was based upon actual results through that date and, as we said on the call, the assumption that growth rates would decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter. Hotel room night growth rates for our international business instead accelerated through the remainder of the quarter. And as we'll see in a moment when we discuss guidance, these bookings are expected to contribute to gross profit growth in Q1 upon checkout.
Performance was generally strong across all regions, with newer markets for Booking.com, namely North America, Asia Pacific and South America growing well in excess of our consolidated growth rate. But we do see softer growth rates in ADR trends for certain Southern European countries.
Rental car days booked were up by 34%, driven mainly by strong growth for our rentalcars.com business. The rentalcars.com team has done a good job of transitioning the brand and building their infrastructure. The business delivered results in 2011 that exceeded our expectations and is off to a good start in 2012.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 16% exceeded our forecast for 13% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 6% in the quarter, reflecting good growth in the retail airline tickets, partly offset by a modest decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited availability to discounted tickets, resulting from further capacity flux by the airline industry. An 11% increase in average retail ticket prices also contributed to gross bookings growth.
U.S. rental car business had a good quarter, helped by strong retail bookings and availability of discounted rates for its opaque business. The strong gross bookings performance helped drive bottom line results that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance and First Call consensus.
Gross profit for the quarter was $725 million and grew 51% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $609 million, which constituted an increase of 63% as compared to the prior year, an increase of 66% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $116 million, which represented 10% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 46.5% for Q4 2011 as compared to 46.1% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 40 bps of additional operating leverage. However, online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 220 bps higher than prior year, primarily as a result of business mix. Our international business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. business, driving the mixed impact. In addition, our price on U.S. business continues to see an increase in share of its business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $344 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $310 million to $330 million, and represents 54% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 58%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $282 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter 2011, which represents a 57% increase versus prior year. We spent about $17 million on CapEx in the quarter, and we spent about $47 million on a full year basis, which represents a sizable increase compared to prior year. This spending is principally for additional IT capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion, including new office facilities for Booking.com in Amsterdam and the U.K. We expect future CapEx spending to also be higher than historical prior year levels as we continue to spend to support business growth.
At quarter close, our cash and investments of $2.7 billion exceed our outstanding debt balance by about $2.1 billion. We also have a $1 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn and does not expire until 2016.
Now for first quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 33% to 38%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 41% to 46% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 43% to 48%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q1 will be flat to up slightly for our international hotel service and up by about 5% to 6% for our U.S. hotel service. Our Q1 forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.34 per euro and $1.59 per British pound as Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 3% for the euro and by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. Although euro has increased in value versus the U.S. dollar recently, it is important to remember that, given challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter.
We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 22% to 27% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 40% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to grow at a slower pace than gross profit, mainly due to deleveraged and online advertising expense, where we expect to continue to see a trend of our business mix shifting to international and online paid channels. In addition, we assume that Q1 margins will be impacted by our continued investment in people, offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense related to CapEx to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $243 million and $253 million, which at the midpoint represents 43% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $3.80 to $3.90 per share, which at the midpoint represents 45% growth over prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and the alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our GAAP EPS guidance -- our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.7 million shares based upon Friday's closing stock price of $590.41. We expect to report GAAP EPS of $3.10 to $3.20 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are reconciled in detail in our earnings release.
Our guidance reflects the growth rate deceleration observed in our actual results to date and assumes continued deceleration through the remainder of the quarter. We believe that the gross bookings growth rates inherent in our Q1 guidance are likely impacted by a challenging comparable quarter for Q1 2011 in which we experienced exhilaration in growth rates as compared to Q4 2010. Our Q1 2012 growth rate has also likely been impacted by extreme weather across Europe and the impact of weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns in Europe.
We believe that our reported results demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we have seen short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for our International business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rate and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries, likely due to economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If these problems were to intensify or spread to other key markets, our business would be adversely impacted.
I want to take a moment to comment on a few industry and market factors as we look to the balance of 2012. A number of our competitors have experienced substantial margin compression as part of a program of investment to position their businesses for growth. On the other hand, our group has seen improvement in operating leverage over the past several years. While we do not currently foresee substantial margin compression associated with large IT platform rebuilds and the like, there are factors that could put pressure on margins going forward, including continued growth in the mix of paid online business; decreases in marketing ROIs tied to click costs, pressure on unit economics or conversion rates; high growth in markets like Asia, which are at an earlier stage of development and have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets; and continued investment in geographic expansion and hotel additions, which may, as Jeff just discussed, provide diminishing returns over time. We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions."

If you look at how long both Agoda and Booking.com have been in the APAC market, the relative market share that both brands have, the massive size of that market, especially when you take into consideration China and Japan, which have very, very low penetration of multinational online travel agents selling in market. We have to look at that as a multi-year opportunity. We view that is as good news because it means we have -- if we can execute a long period of growth to look forward to and keep in mind that we've been investing in those markets for years. And we're able to do so, I think, with still having a respectable margin situation. Put another way, we make money in APAC. We're not deficit spending. It's just that the margins in that market are not as high, the operating margins, as they are in other markets where we've been in operating for a longer time. With respect to rentalcars.com, we're excited about the opportunity for rentalcars.com, but we are mindful of the fact that the rental car market internationally is a much smaller market than the hotel market. And therefore, the opportunity to grow and to grow to be of a material size to the group is something that's going to take longer. While there is some cross-sell that we do take advantage of and we'll continue to take advantage of, rentalcars.com is going to have to be successful, completely independent of that, because the cross-sell opportunities are not going to be enough to really build that into a giant business by themselves. And so that's one of the reasons we're excited about the re-branding because we think under one URL, a URL as good as rentalcars.com, you've got a real shot at building a very strong international brand that can stand on its own."

So if fuel prices go higher or stay elevated for a prolonged period of time, that's a negative factor. But it hasn't had a negative impact to-date. In terms of parsing it by segment or travel, I mean, the higher fuel prices typically drive even higher airline ticket prices. We've already seen that over the last several quarters even without the dramatically higher fuel prices. So we've already been contending with that. Higher ticket prices also make it harder for leisure travelers to be able to afford the travel, and that's not helpful.

Our business, the international business in particular, peaks in the summer. And with the growth rates we've been experiencing, it's important to hire up customer service associates to handle that business. And in addition, as we've been expanding geographically and building the hotel inventory, we need to hire people to be out in the regions visiting the hotels and making sure we have them signed up in the first instance and rates and availability on an ongoing basis. All of those people get productive very, very quickly. But there's an element of variability to it because we need more of them as the business grows and as the hotel inventory grows. So I think that's the way to look at that. We may have relatively more or relatively fewer than we actually need at any given point in time, and that can drive a little positive or negative leverage. And if you look at our conference calls over the past couple of years, you can see some verbiage about that. But I don't think those variances are material to the long-term profitability of the model. With respect to CPCs in Europe and your question about where the investment goes, our investment is way, way emphasized on paid channels. So if you look at what we're spending in online marketing, that's paid marketing.

I guess implicitly, it looks like gross margin in your guidance is going to be going up in the U.S. as well. I guess, as we think about that, is the bigger shift here that 2012 may be more of a year of scaling up the Booking.com brand in the U.S. market than kind of going really after that hotel opportunity since you seem to be signing up quite a few hotels, at least domestically? And then second, maybe another way to kind of look at Booking.com, but can you talk about where the percentage of mix of hotels ends up going to between U.S., Europe and Asia?"

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared potion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $6.7 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $4.28 per share, up 61% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $3.95 per share and our guidance for the quarter. 
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 45.9 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year. Our International business recorded 58% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 67% in Q4. Growth rates benefited generally from higher ADRs and continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. Growth rates were impacted by slowing growth in southern European markets and the difficult comp, as bookings growth accelerated in the first 2 quarters of last year. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 210,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 55% over last year and is building its brand in new markets by driving reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Our goal to continue to expand its networks of hotels and is building APAC distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing APAC market and can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world.
We believe the group's International Hotel business is providing great value to its hotel partners. For Booking.com and Agoda, approximately 90% of booked room nights in 2011 went to independent and small group hotels, and approximately 70% of those room nights represented reservations for travel in another country.
Through our platform and substantial marketing spend, we believe we are providing our participating hotels with a very efficient way to reach the international leisure traveling. Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the first quarter due primarily to growth and retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by improved ADRs, growth in retail online ticket sales and higher fares and growth in domestic rental car reservations.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 34% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth of 41% in rental car days represent substantial acceleration from Q4, reflecting improved results in the U.S. business and the growing contribution from Rentalcars.com.
Economic conditions in Europe remain a challenge, and are reflected in the lower level of growth rates in southern peripheral countries and a weakening on the euro, which puts pressure on our dollar-denominated results. We also announced the changes in the political environment, which add additional uncertainty.
In light of these uncertainties, we believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue expanding and building our brands, which provides substantial earnings through invested in growth while maintaining attractive operatives. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus on execution. 
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,193458659,302296,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 09, 2012",2012-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period,",1849,"Thank you, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. 
Q1 gross bookings grew by 44%, driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservations business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 47% in the first quarter, a deceleration compared to the 53% growth rate achieved in Q4. Average daily rates or ADRs were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our International Hotel service and by over 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2012. These results were favorable to our guidance assumption for international ADRs and in line with forecasts for the U.S.. FX rates for the first quarter for the Euro and British pound were slightly unfavorable for the rates we assumed in our guidance at about 4% and 2%, respectively, unfavorable compared to the prior year.
Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 54% and by 50% on a local currency basis. In both cases, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The guidance we gave on February 27 was based upon actual results through that date. And as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates will decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter.
Hotel room night growth rates for our International business instead accelerated slightly throughout the remainder of the quarter. Performance was generally strong across all regions. And we believe that we increased our share of the hotel reservation market, both in the U.S. and internationally during the quarter. We did see softer growth rates in ADR trends for certain southern European countries. Rental Car days booked were up by 41%, driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. This growth rate reflects acceleration versus Q1 for Rental Car days booked through our international and U.S. businesses.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 12% exceeded our forecast for 10% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 5%, driven by retail airline tickets, partly offset by a significant decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited supply, resulting from airline capacity cuts.
Average airline ticket prices increased by 5% in the quarter. The decrease in Name Your Own Price airline tickets and Name Your Own Price hotel room nights booked has a more pronounced impact on revenue and merchant revenue in particular, since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue with supply or cost recorded in cost of revenue.
Strong unit growth, combined with some favorability in international ADRs, resulted in over performance in key operating metrics compared to the top end of our range of guidance and Wall Street consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $743 million and grew 47% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated growth profit of $617 million, which constituted an increase of 59% as compared to the prior year, and an increase of 65% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounts to $127 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 35.8% for Q1 2012 as compared to 34.9% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 90 bps of additional operating leverage.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast, but online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 70 bps higher than prior year, primarily as a result of business mix.
Our international brands, which rely more on our online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. priceline.com business, driving the mix impact. In addition, we continue to see an increasing share of business coming through paid channels. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $272 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $243 million to $253 million and represents 57% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 61%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate through the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K. 
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $182 million of cash from operations during the first quarter 2012, which represents a 34% decrease versus prior year. The decrease is driven largely by our decision to prepay in the quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year, and so subsequent quarters of 2012 will have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $14 million on CapEx in the quarter. As we announced in March, we completed a $1 billion convertible debt offering during the first quarter. We believe this represents attractive financing for the company, with a coupon interest rate of 1% and a conversion price of $945 per share. The debt has a 6-year maturity date, and generally cannot be converted prior to maturity unless our stock trades above $1,417 per share. We used $166 million of the proceeds to repurchase shares of Priceline's common stock concurrent with the offering. In total, we repurchased $254 million of our common stock in Q1.
The remaining proceeds, as well as our other cash and investments totaling $3.6 billion at quarter close, are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment.
Now for second quarter 2012 guidance. We have a difficult comp in Q2 because unit growth in prior year Q2 was very strong. As I mentioned on our earnings call last year when we reported Q2, our unit growth per hotel room nights accelerated over the back half of the quarter, which provides an even more challenging comp for the remainder of this quarter. Our top line forecast for Q2 reflect our actual results to date, and assumes fairly significant deceleration over the back half of the quarter in light of the difficult comp. 
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 26% to 31%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 32% to 37% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 41% to 46%.
Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q2 will be flat to down slightly for our International Hotel service compared to up 4% in Q2 2011 and up 2% in Q1. Our forecast assumes Q2 ADRs up 5% or 6% for our U.S. hotel service.
The current level of the U.S. dollar versus Q2 last year, particularly in relation to the euro, will present a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remains at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.62 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 9% for the euro and by 1% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
It is important to remember that given the challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter.
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 18% to 23% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 31% to 36%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to show very modest deleverage as a percent of gross profit. 
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, we assume that margins in Q2 and beyond will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix, and potential reduction in ROIs and investment in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $450 million and $470 million, which at the midpoint, represents 32% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.40 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 33% growth over the prior year.
Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q2, related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.5%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and save taxes from the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based on yesterday's closing stock price of $716.20. We forecast GAAP EPS of $6.34 to $6.54 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. 
We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth, given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expect sequential decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011.
We believe that our reported results for Q1 and forecasted results for Q2 demonstrate considerable resilience given the macro economic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. Resent European election results increased uncertainty regarding Europe's path forward to addres sovereign debt challenges. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results today, we continue to seek short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for our International business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rates in ADR transfer to certain southern European country, likely due to the economic conditions in sovereign debt concerns. If macroeconomic conditions were to worsen, it would likely impact consumer discretionary spending, which in turn would likely adversely impact the travel market. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular.

And so we've reflected fairly significant deceleration for the back half this year as a result of that comp.

And it's driven not only by the functionality that we're really seeing in the marketplace, but just the proliferation of the devices and consumer adoption. So continues to be fast growing source of business, very -- we continue to be very excited about it in all of our brands are devoting resources to try to capture that opportunity. We are finding our businesses generally performing well in mobile environments. Our applications are ranked well. We've got good traction in terms of downloads. A couple of our brands, Booking.com and priceline.com, have Tonight-Only kinds of offerings. And those are performing well, but I think it's fair to say that the demand for hotels goes beyond the inventory that's available for Tonight-Only discount. So it's making a lot of reservations for normal everyday savings on Booking.com. We're making a lot of reservations for opaque hotels and priceline.com, where we have the broadest supply of deeply discounted inventory of any other player. And it's really a great opportunity to promote those kinds of products doing well in the rental car space here in the United States. So we continue to be very excited about it. With respect to China, hotel counts for both Booking.com and Agoda are increasing, and we're developing resources to increasing our hotel coverage in China. The principal sources of demand for those hotels remains the international traveler for both Booking.com and for Agoda, the international traveler in the APAC region. I think we're doing reasonably well selling international destinations to Chinese travelers, because we have at least, in our view, some of the best product out there for them. The purely domestic traveler is something that's still -- is an opportunity that we're not deeply penetrated in. We have some business. We're looking on it. We'll continue to work on it, but that's not a big part of the business today."

I noted in my prepared remarks that the hotel count, hotel and other accommodation count for Booking.com was up over 50% year-over-year, and that gives an indication that we're still able to add additional properties. I've also said in the past that some of these properties are smaller hotels or it's sort of a combination. So if maybe a point of diminishing return with respect to signing up some of these properties may not be as valuable. Some of the earlier properties that we've signed up, but I think there's a lot of room especially in the new markets. With respect to capital deployment, our approach to that has not changed. We remain opportunistic. We have an open authorization to repurchase additional common shares if we should decide to do that. And we also remained active in looking at other businesses as we have over the last 10 years, and are happy to have a fairly substantial amount of capital to do that if that becomes opportunistic as well."

Some of those properties are not hotels, they're being envisioned vacation apartments and the like. So as I mentioned previously, it's not the same as adding a hotel that's got 1,000 rooms there or something, but it provides additional accommodations for customers and adds value to the platform. So we continue to find properties and accommodations to bring on to the website. As I mentioned in response the earlier question, availability continues to be very important, but there's a lot of very big regions outside of Europe where we've got some substantial hotel staff for both Booking.com and Agoda signing up new hotels and new properties. So I do think that the growth that we've been able to demonstrate in the Booking.com hotel platform has been pretty impressive over the last year, at least in our opinion, despite having been at this in the European market for many, many years and successfully so. With respect to the increase in pay traffic, any online consumer facing business with love for all the customers to come directly to our website without going anywhere else first. And so we try very hard to build a strong brands and outstanding user experience so that if we have to pay for a customer once, we have a very good chance of getting them back directly in our data shows, we do a pretty good job of driving repeat business. Having said that, paid channels in the online world provide measurable and attractive way to access new customers. And so we like to see the business grow in pay channels. And in fact, it's critical to the growth of our business around the world that we continue to do well in paid channels. If you look at the thing that's driving the biggest part of the mix, with that Dan mentioned, the International business, which really is an online brands, our all online brands are going faster than the domestic business. And at the very highest level, that's something that we're very happy about, because it's building franchise value and building our earnings."

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $6.7 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $4.28 per share, up 61% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $3.95 (sic) [$3.97] per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 45.9 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 58% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 67% in Q4. Growth rates benefited generally from higher ADRs and continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. Growth rates were impacted by slowing growth in Southern European markets and a difficult comp as bookings growth accelerated in the first 2 quarters of last year. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 210,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 55% over last year, and is building its brand in new markets by driving reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Agoda continues to expand its network of hotels and is building APAC distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing APAC market and can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world.
We believe the group's international hotel business is providing great value to its hotel partners. For Booking.com and Agoda, approximately 90% of booked room nights in 2011 went to independent and small group hotels and approximately 70% of those room nights represented reservations for travel in another country. Through our platform and substantial marketing spend, we believe we are providing our participating hotels with a very efficient way to reach the international leisure traveler.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the first quarter due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by improved ADRs, growth in retail airline ticket sales and higher fares and then growth in domestic rental car reservations. Merchant gross bookings growth of 34% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth of 41% in rental car days represents substantial acceleration from Q4, reflecting improved results in the U.S. business and the growing contribution from Rentalcars.com.
Economic conditions in Europe remain a challenge and are reflected in the lower relative growth rates in southern peripheral countries and a weakening of the euro, which puts pressure on our dollar-denominated results. We also announced a few changes in the political environment which add additional uncertainty.
In light of these uncertainties, we believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue expanding and building our brands, which provides substantial earnings to reinvest in growth while maintaining attractive operating margins. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights on operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 gross bookings grew by 44% driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 47% in the first quarter, a deceleration compared to the 53% growth rate achieved in Q4. Average daily rates or ADRs were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2012. These results were favorable to our guidance assumption for international ADRs and in line with forecasts for the U.S..
FX rates for the first quarter for the euro and British pound were slightly unfavorable for the rates we assumed in our guidance at about 4% and 2%, respectively, unfavorable compared to the prior year.
Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 54%, and by 58% on a local currency basis, in both cases exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The guidance we gave on February 27 was based upon actual results through that date and, as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates will decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter.
Hotel room night growth rates for our international business instead accelerated slightly throughout the remainder of the quarter. Performance was generally strong across all regions, and we believe that we increased our share of the hotel reservation market both in the U.S. and internationally during the quarter. We did see softer growth rates and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries. Rental car days booked were up by 41%, driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. This growth rate reflects acceleration versus Q1 for rental car days booked both through our international and U.S. businesses.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 12% exceeded our forecast for 10% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 5%, driven by retail airline tickets, partly offset by a significant decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited supply resulting from airline capacity cuts. Average airline ticket prices increased by 5% in the quarter.
The decrease in Name Your Own Price airline tickets and Name Your Own Price hotel room nights booked has a more pronounced impact on revenue and merchant revenue in particular since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue, with supply or cost recorded in cost of revenue.
Strong unit growth, combined with some favorability in international ADRs, resulted in over-performance in key operating metrics compared to the top end of our range of guidance and Wall Street consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $743 million and grew 47%, as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $617 million, which constituted an increase of 59% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 65% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounts to $127 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 35.8% for Q1 2012, as compared to 34.9% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 90 bps of additional operating leverage.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast, but online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 70 bps higher than prior year primarily as a result of business mix. Our international brands, which rely more on our online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. priceline.com business, driving the mix impact. In addition, we continue to see an increasing share of business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $272 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $243 million to $253 million and represents 57% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 61%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $182 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2012, which represents a 34% decrease versus prior year. The decrease is driven largely by our decision to prepay in the quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year and so subsequent quarters of 2012 will have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $14 million on CapEx in the quarter. As we announced in March, we completed a $1 billion convertible debt offering during the first quarter. We believe this represents attractive financing for the company, with a coupon interest rate of 1% and a conversion price of $945 per share. The debt has a 6-year maturity date and generally cannot be converted prior to maturity, unless our stock trades above $1,417 per share. We used $166 million of the proceeds to repurchase shares of Priceline common stock concurrent with the offering. In total, we repurchased $254 million of our common stock in Q1.
The remaining proceeds, as well as our other cash and investments totaling $3.6 billion at quarter close, are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.
Now for second quarter 2012 guidance. We have a difficult comp in Q2 because unit growth in prior-year Q2 was very strong. As I mentioned on our earnings call last year when we reported Q2, our unit growth per hotel room nights accelerated over the back half of the quarter, which provides an even more challenging comp for the remainder of this quarter. Our top line forecast for Q2 reflects our actual results to date and assumes fairly significant deceleration over the back half of the quarter in light of the difficult comp.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 26% to 31%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 32% to 37% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 41% to 46%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q2 will be flat to down slightly for our international hotel service compared to up 4% in Q2 2011 and up 2% in Q1. Our forecast assumes Q2 ADRs up by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service.
The current level of the U.S. dollar versus Q2 last year, particularly in relation to the euro, will present a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.62 per British pound, as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 9% for the euro and by 1% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
It is important to remember that, given the challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter.
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 18% to 23% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 31% to 36%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to show very modest deleverage as a percent of gross profit.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, we assume that margins in Q2 and beyond will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and potential reduction in ROIs and investment in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $450 million and $470 million, which at the midpoint represents 32% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.40 per share, which at the midpoint represents 33% growth over the prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q2 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.5%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impacts of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. And we expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based on yesterday's closing stock price of $716.20. We forecast GAAP EPS of $6.34 to $6.54 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011.
We believe that our reported results for Q1 and forecasted results for Q2 demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. The recent European election results increased uncertainty regarding Europe's path forward to address sovereign debt challenges. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we continue to see short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for our international business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rates and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries, likely due to the economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If macroeconomic conditions were to worsen, it would likely impact consumer discretionary spending which in turn would likely adversely impact the travel market.
Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. 
We will now take your questions."

So overall, it was deceleration for the quarter. In terms of linearity on Q2, each month is progressively more significant than the last month and so the biggest part of the quarter, by far, is yet to come. Our forecast reflects the fact that, last year, it was a very strong performance with strong acceleration year-over-year and so we've reflected fairly significant deceleration for the back half this year as a result of that comp.

So continues to be a fast-growing source of business, very -- we continue to be very excited about it. And all of our brands are devoting resources to try to capture that opportunity. We are finding our businesses generally performing well in mobile environments. Our applications are ranked well. We've got good traction in terms of downloads. A couple of our brands, Booking.com and priceline.com, have Tonight-Only kinds of offerings. And those are performing well, but I think it's fair to say that the demand for hotels goes beyond the inventory that's available for a Tonight-Only discount. So we're just making a lot of reservations for normal everyday savings on Booking.com. We're making a lot of reservations for opaque hotels on priceline.com where we have the broadest supply of deeply discounted inventory of any other player. And it's really a great opportunity to promote those kinds of products, doing well in the rental car space here in the United States. So we continue to be very excited about it. With respect to China, hotel counts for both Booking.com and Agoda are increasing, and we're developing resources to increasing our hotel coverage in China. The principal sources of demand for those hotels remains the international traveler for both Booking.com, and for Agoda, the international traveler in the APAC region. I think we're doing reasonably well selling international destinations to Chinese travelers because we have, at least in our view, some of the best product out there for them. The purely domestic traveler is something that's still -- is an opportunity that's we're not deeply penetrated in. We have some business. We're working on it. We'll continue to work on it, but that's not a big part of the business today."

Some of these properties may not be as valuable as some of the earlier properties that we've signed up, but I think there's a lot of running room especially in the new markets.

Some of those properties are not hotels, they're B&Bs and vacation apartments and the like. So as I've mentioned previously, it's not the same as adding a hotel that's got 1,000 rooms in it or something, but it provides additional accommodations for customers and adds value to the platform. So we continue to find properties and accommodations to bring on to the website. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question, availability continues to be very important, but there's a lot of very big regions outside of Europe where we've got some substantial hotel staff for both Booking.com and Agoda signing up new hotels and new properties. So I do think that the growth that we've been able to demonstrate in the Booking.com hotel platform has been pretty impressive over the last year, at least in our opinion, despite having been at this in the European market for many, many years and successfully so. With respect to the increase in paid traffic, any online consumer-facing business would love for all of the customers to come directly to our website without going anywhere else first, and so we try very hard to build our strong brands and outstanding user experience so that, if we have to pay for a customer once, we have a very good chance of getting them back directly. And our data shows we do a pretty good job of driving repeat business. Having said that, paid channels in the online world provide measurable and attractive way to access new customers and so we like to see the business grow in paid channels. And in fact, it's critical to the growth of our business around the world that we continue to do well in paid channels. If you look at the thing that's driving the biggest part of the mix with -- Dan mentioned, it's really the fact that the international business, which really is in online brands, or our all online brands, are going faster than the domestic business.

The critical element in all of this is that, in order for somebody to advertise, though, they have to have something to sell and they have to have a website and a consumer proposition that converts because you can spend all the money in the world but that's not going to guarantee that the customer actually buys something when they get to your website.

That could have a potentially significant impact on our operating leverage. But besides that, the other factors are not quite as dramatic. We've had some ramp-up in personnel to make sure that we're able to handle the current size of the business and future expected growth. We've opened some new offices. We've invested in IT and we've had increased depreciation expense. So those are other items that contribute to pressure on our operating margins.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $6.7 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $4.28 per share, up 61% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $3.95 (sic) [$3.97] per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 45.9 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 58% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 67% in Q4. Growth rates benefited generally from higher ADRs and continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. Growth rates were impacted by slowing growth in Southern European markets and a difficult comp as bookings growth accelerated in the first 2 quarters of last year. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 210,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 55% over last year, and is building its brand in new markets by driving reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Agoda continues to expand its network of hotels and is building APAC distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing APAC market and can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world.
We believe the group's international hotel business is providing great value to its hotel partners. For Booking.com and Agoda, approximately 90% of booked room nights in 2011 went to independent and small group hotels and approximately 70% of those room nights represented reservations for travel in another country. Through our platform and substantial marketing spend, we believe we are providing our participating hotels with a very efficient way to reach the international leisure traveler.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the first quarter due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by improved ADRs, growth in retail airline ticket sales and higher fares and growth in domestic rental car reservations. Merchant gross bookings growth of 34% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth of 41% in rental car days represents substantial acceleration from Q4, reflecting improved results in the U.S. business and the growing contribution from Rentalcars.com.
Economic conditions in Europe remain a challenge and are reflected in the lower relative growth rates in southern peripheral countries and a weakening of the euro, which puts pressure on our dollar-denominated results. We also now see changes in the political environment which add additional uncertainty.
In light of these uncertainties, we believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue expanding and building our brands, which provides substantial earnings to reinvest in growth while maintaining attractive operating margins. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights on operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 gross bookings grew by 44% driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 47% in the first quarter, a deceleration compared to the 53% growth rate achieved in Q4. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2012. These results were favorable to our guidance assumption for international ADRs and in line with forecasts for the U.S.
FX rates for the first quarter for the euro and British pound were slightly unfavorable for the rates we assumed in our guidance at about 4% and 2%, respectively, unfavorable compared to the prior year.
Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 54%, and by 58% on a local currency basis, in both cases exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The guidance we gave on February 27 was based upon actual results through that date and, as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter.
Hotel room night growth rates for our international business instead accelerated slightly throughout the remainder of the quarter. Performance was generally strong across all regions, and we believe that we increased our share of the hotel reservation market both in the U.S. and internationally during the quarter. We did see softer growth rates and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries. Rental car days booked were up by 41%, driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. This growth rate reflects acceleration versus Q1 for rental car days booked both through our international and U.S. businesses.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 12% exceeded our forecast for 10% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 5%, driven by retail airline tickets, partly offset by a significant decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited supply resulting from airline capacity cuts. Average airline ticket prices increased by 5% in the quarter.
The decrease in Name Your Own Price airline tickets and Name Your Own Price hotel room nights booked has a more pronounced impact on revenue, and merchant revenue in particular, since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue, with supplier cost recorded in cost of revenue.
Strong unit growth, combined with some favorability in international ADRs, resulted in over-performance in key operating metrics compared to the top end of our range of guidance and Wall Street consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $743 million and grew 47%, as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $617 million, which constituted an increase of 59% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 65% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounts to $127 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 35.8% for Q1 2012, as compared to 34.9% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 90 bps of additional operating leverage.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast, but online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 70 bps higher than prior year primarily as a result of business mix. Our international brands, which rely more on our online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. priceline.com business, driving the mix impact. In addition, we continue to see an increasing share of business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $272 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $243 million to $253 million and represents 57% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 61%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $182 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2012, which represents a 34% decrease versus prior year. The decrease is driven largely by our decision to prepay in the quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year and so subsequent quarters of 2012 will have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $14 million on CapEx in the quarter. As we announced in March, we completed a $1 billion convertible debt offering during the first quarter. We believe this represents attractive financing for the company, with a coupon interest rate of 1% and a conversion price of $945 per share. The debt has a 6-year maturity date and generally cannot be converted prior to maturity, unless our stock trades above $1,417 per share. We used $166 million of the proceeds to repurchase shares of Priceline common stock concurrent with the offering. In total, we repurchased $254 million of our common stock in Q1.
The remaining proceeds, as well as our other cash and investments totaling $3.6 billion at quarter close, are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.
Now for second quarter 2012 guidance. We have a difficult comp in Q2 because unit growth in prior-year Q2 was very strong. As I mentioned on our earnings call last year when we reported Q2, our unit growth per hotel room nights accelerated over the back half of the quarter, which provides an even more challenging comp for the remainder of this quarter. Our top line forecast for Q2 reflects our actual results to date and assumes fairly significant deceleration over the back half of the quarter in light of the difficult comp.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 26% to 31%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 32% to 37% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 41% to 46%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q2 will be flat to down slightly for our international hotel service compared to up 4% in Q2 2011 and up 2% in Q1. Our forecast assumes Q2 ADRs up by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service.
The current level of the U.S. dollar versus Q2 last year, particularly in relation to the euro, will present a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.62 per British pound, as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 9% for the euro and by 1% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
It is important to remember that, given the challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter.
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 18% to 23% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 31% to 36%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to show very modest deleverage as a percent of gross profit.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, we assume that margins in Q2 and beyond will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and potential reduction in ROIs and investment in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $450 million and $470 million, which at the midpoint represents 32% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.40 per share, which at the midpoint represents 33% growth over the prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q2 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.5%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $716.20. We forecast GAAP EPS of $6.34 to $6.54 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011.
We believe that our reported results for Q1 and forecasted results for Q2 demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. The recent European election results increased uncertainty regarding Europe's path forward to address sovereign debt challenges. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we continue to see short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for our international business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rates and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries, likely due to the economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If macroeconomic conditions were to worsen, it would likely impact consumer discretionary spending which in turn would likely adversely impact the travel market.
Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. 
We will now take your questions."

In terms of linearity on Q2, each month is progressively more significant than the last month and so the biggest part of the quarter, by far, is yet to come. Our forecast reflects the fact that, last year, it was a very strong performance with strong acceleration year-over-year and so we've reflected fairly significant deceleration for the back half this year as a result of that comp. In terms of regions in Europe, the only one that we've called out really as noticeable in terms of softness in growth rate and ADR trend is Southern Europe and only certain countries within southern Europe.

So continues to be a fast-growing source of business, very -- we continue to be very excited about it. And all of our brands are devoting resources to try to capture that opportunity. We are finding our businesses generally performing well in mobile environments. Our applications are ranked well. We've got good traction in terms of downloads. A couple of our brands, Booking.com and priceline.com, have Tonight-Only kinds of offerings. And those are performing well, but I think it's fair to say that the demand for hotels goes beyond the inventory that's available for a Tonight-Only discount. So we're just making a lot of reservations for normal everyday savings on Booking.com. We're making a lot of reservations for opaque hotels on priceline.com where we have the broadest supply of deeply discounted inventory of any other player. And it's really a great opportunity to promote those kinds of products, doing well in the rental car space here in the United States. So we continue to be very excited about it. With respect to China, hotel counts for both Booking.com and Agoda are increasing, and we're devoting resources to increasing our hotel coverage in China. The principal sources of demand for those hotels remains the international traveler for both Booking.com and for Agoda, the international traveler in the APAC region. I think we're doing reasonably well selling international destinations to Chinese travelers because we have, at least in our view, some of the best product out there for them. The purely domestic traveler is something that's still -- is an opportunity that's -- we're not deeply penetrated in. We have some business. We're working on it. We'll continue to work on it, but that's not a big part of the business today."

Is there still a lot of opportunity for you to add hotels, or is it really just about bookings per hotel? And how much room do you still have there? And then I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, traffic from paid channels is increasing. Does that concern you? Is that something that we might have to worry about margin pressure down the road?"

Some of those properties are not hotels, they're B&Bs and vacation apartments and the like. So as I've mentioned previously, it's not the same as adding a hotel that's got 1,000 rooms in it or something, but it provides additional accommodations for customers and adds value to the platform. So we continue to find properties and accommodations to bring on to the website. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question, availability continues to be very important, but there's a lot of very big regions outside of Europe where we've got some substantial hotel staff for both Booking.com and Agoda signing up new hotels and new properties. So I do think that the growth that we've been able to demonstrate in the Booking.com hotel platform has been pretty impressive over the last year, at least in our opinion, despite having been at this in the European market for many, many years and successfully so. With respect to the increase in paid traffic, any online consumer-facing business would love for all of the customers to come directly to our website without going anywhere else first, and so we try very hard to build our strong brands and an outstanding user experience so that, if we have to pay for a customer once, we have a very good chance of getting them back directly. And our data shows we do a pretty good job of driving repeat business. Having said that, paid channels in the online world provide measurable and attractive way to access new customers and so we'd like to see the business grow in paid channels. And in fact, it's critical to the growth of our business around the world that we continue to do well in paid channels. If you look at the thing that's driving the biggest part of the mix that Dan mentioned, it's really the fact that the international business, which really is in online brands, or our all online brands, are going faster than the domestic business. And at the very highest level, that's something that we're very happy about because it's building franchise value and building our earnings."

Not only are our major competitors there and effectively so, there are a lot of local businesses that are our solid competitors too in the search marketplace. So we don't feel like we're operating in a market that doesn't have solid competition in it today. And based on the public pronouncements of Expedia in particular, I think they have been very aggressive in Asia over the last couple of years, and I would expect them to continue to be so. The critical element in all of this is that, in order for somebody to advertise, though, they have to have something to sell and they have to have a website and a consumer proposition that converts because you can spend all the money in the world but that's not a guarantee that the customer actually buys something when they get to your website. And I think that's the challenge that we all face when we go into a new market. But we've had pretty good success in building that organic growth, first, with the international traveler who wants to go to that new destination and then, over time, with the domestic traveler."

We've had some ramp-up in personnel to make sure that we're able to handle the current size of the business and future expected growth. We've opened some new offices. We've invested in IT and we've had increased depreciation expense. So those are other items that contribute to pressure on operating margins.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $6.7 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $4.28 per share, up 61% versus prior year. First quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $3.95 (sic) [$3.97] per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 45.9 million for the quarter, up 47% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 58% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 67% in Q4. Growth rates benefited generally from higher ADRs and continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. Growth rates were impacted by slowing growth in Southern European markets and a difficult comp as bookings growth accelerated in the first 2 quarters of last year. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 210,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 55% over last year, and is building its brand in new markets by driving reservations to those destinations and growing demand in those regions for hotels around the world. Agoda continues to expand its network of hotels and is building APAC distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing APAC market and can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world.
We believe the group's international hotel business is providing great value to its hotel partners. For Booking.com and Agoda, approximately 90% of booked room nights in 2011 went to independent and small group hotels and approximately 70% of those room nights represented reservations for travel in another country. Through our platform and substantial marketing spend, we believe we are providing our participating hotels with a very efficient way to reach the international leisure traveler.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the first quarter due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by improved ADRs, growth in retail airline ticket sales and higher fares and growth in domestic rental car reservations. Merchant gross bookings growth of 34% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth of 41% in rental car days represents substantial acceleration from Q4, reflecting improved results in the U.S. business and the growing contribution from Rentalcars.com.
Economic conditions in Europe remain a challenge and are reflected in the lower relative growth rates in southern peripheral countries and a weakening of the euro, which puts pressure on our dollar-denominated results. We also now see changes in the political environment which add additional uncertainty.
In light of these uncertainties, we believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter, and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue expanding and building our brands, which provides substantial earnings to reinvest in growth while maintaining attractive operating margins. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights on operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 gross bookings grew by 44% driven mainly by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 47% in the first quarter, a deceleration compared to the 53% growth rate achieved in Q4. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were up on a local currency basis by approximately 2% for our international hotel service and by over 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q1 2012. These results were favorable to our guidance assumption for international ADRs and in line with forecasts for the U.S.
FX rates for the first quarter for the euro and British pound were slightly unfavorable for the rates we assumed in our guidance at about 4% and 2%, respectively, unfavorable compared to the prior year.
Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 54%, and by 58% on a local currency basis, in both cases exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The guidance we gave on February 27 was based upon actual results through that date and, as we said on the call, an assumption that growth rates would decelerate as we proceeded through the remainder of the quarter.
Hotel room night growth rates for our international business instead accelerated slightly throughout the remainder of the quarter. Performance was generally strong across all regions, and we believe that we increased our share of the hotel reservation market both in the U.S. and internationally during the quarter. We did see softer growth rates and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries. Rental car days booked were up by 41%, driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. This growth rate reflects acceleration versus Q1 for rental car days booked both through our international and U.S. businesses.
Gross bookings growth for our U.S. business of 12% exceeded our forecast for 10% growth. Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs were key drivers in year-over-year growth. Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined slightly, likely as a result of competitive discount hotel initiatives. Airline tickets booked were up by 5%, driven by retail airline tickets, partly offset by a significant decrease in Name Your Own Price tickets due to limited supply resulting from airline capacity cuts. Average airline ticket prices increased by 5% in the quarter.
The decrease in Name Your Own Price airline tickets and Name Your Own Price hotel room nights booked has a more pronounced impact on revenue, and merchant revenue in particular, since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue, with supplier cost recorded in cost of revenue.
Strong unit growth, combined with some favorability in international ADRs, resulted in over-performance in key operating metrics compared to the top end of our range of guidance and Wall Street consensus. Gross profit for the quarter was $743 million and grew 47%, as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $617 million, which constituted an increase of 59% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 65% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounts to $127 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 35.8% for Q1 2012, as compared to 34.9% for the prior year. Operating expenses grew slower than gross profit, resulting in 90 bps of additional operating leverage.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast, but online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 70 bps higher than prior year primarily as a result of business mix. Our international brands, which rely more on our online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than our U.S. priceline.com business, driving the mix impact. In addition, we continue to see an increasing share of business coming through paid channels.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $272 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $243 million to $253 million and represents 57% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 61%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $182 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2012, which represents a 34% decrease versus prior year. The decrease is driven largely by our decision to prepay in the quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year and so subsequent quarters of 2012 will have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $14 million on CapEx in the quarter. As we announced in March, we completed a $1 billion convertible debt offering during the first quarter. We believe this represents attractive financing for the company, with a coupon interest rate of 1% and a conversion price of $945 per share. The debt has a 6-year maturity date and generally cannot be converted prior to maturity, unless our stock trades above $1,417 per share. We used $166 million of the proceeds to repurchase shares of Priceline common stock concurrent with the offering. In total, we repurchased $254 million of our common stock in Q1.
The remaining proceeds, as well as our other cash and investments totaling $3.6 billion at quarter close, are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.
Now for second quarter 2012 guidance. We have a difficult comp in Q2 because unit growth in prior-year Q2 was very strong. As I mentioned on our earnings call last year when we reported Q2, our unit growth per hotel room nights accelerated over the back half of the quarter, which provides an even more challenging comp for the remainder of this quarter. Our top line forecast for Q2 reflects our actual results to date and assumes fairly significant deceleration over the back half of the quarter in light of the difficult comp.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 26% to 31%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by approximately 5% to 10%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 32% to 37% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 41% to 46%. Our guidance assumes that ADRs for Q2 will be flat to down slightly for our international hotel service compared to up 4% in Q2 2011 and up 2% in Q1. Our forecast assumes Q2 ADRs up by about 6% for our U.S. hotel service.
The current level of the U.S. dollar versus Q2 last year, particularly in relation to the euro, will present a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.62 per British pound, as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 9% for the euro and by 1% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
It is important to remember that, given the challenging economic conditions and the sovereign debt issues facing Europe, we are likely to see volatility in the euro-dollar exchange rate, which can materially impact our results expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter.
We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 18% to 23% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 31% to 36%. We expect non-GAAP operating income to show very modest deleverage as a percent of gross profit.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, we assume that margins in Q2 and beyond will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and potential reduction in ROIs and investment in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $450 million and $470 million, which at the midpoint represents 32% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.40 per share, which at the midpoint represents 33% growth over the prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q2 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.5%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $716.20. We forecast GAAP EPS of $6.34 to $6.54 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
We also continue to be generally cautious in our outlook for top line growth given the uncertain worldwide economy, potential currency headwinds affecting our results expressed in U.S. dollars and expected sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011.
We believe that our reported results for Q1 and forecasted results for Q2 demonstrate considerable resilience given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevailed throughout the quarter and continues today. The recent European election results increased uncertainty regarding Europe's path forward to address sovereign debt challenges. While this uncertainty has not had a pronounced impact on our results to date, we continue to see short-term volatility in our unit growth rates and increased cancellation rates for our international business, which makes it more difficult to forecast trends.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we have observed weaker transaction growth rates and ADR trends for certain Southern European countries, likely due to the economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns. If macroeconomic conditions were to worsen, it would likely impact consumer discretionary spending which in turn would likely adversely impact the travel market.
Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular.

In terms of linearity on Q2, each month is progressively more significant than the last month and so the biggest part of the quarter, by far, is yet to come. Our forecast reflects the fact that, last year, it was a very strong performance with strong acceleration year-over-year and so we've reflected fairly significant deceleration for the back half this year as a result of that comp. In terms of regions in Europe, the only one that we've called out really as noticeable in terms of softness in growth rate and ADR trend is Southern Europe and only certain countries within southern Europe.

So continues to be a fast-growing source of business, very -- we continue to be very excited about it. And all of our brands are devoting resources to try to capture that opportunity. We are finding our businesses generally performing well in mobile environments. Our applications are ranked well. We've got good traction in terms of downloads. A couple of our brands, Booking.com and priceline.com, have Tonight-Only kinds of offerings. And those are performing well, but I think it's fair to say that the demand for hotels goes beyond the inventory that's available for a Tonight-Only discount. So we're just making a lot of reservations for normal everyday savings on Booking.com. We're making a lot of reservations for opaque hotels on priceline.com where we have the broadest supply of deeply discounted inventory of any other player. And it's really a great opportunity to promote those kinds of products, doing well in the rental car space here in the United States. So we continue to be very excited about it. With respect to China, hotel counts for both Booking.com and Agoda are increasing, and we're devoting resources to increasing our hotel coverage in China. The principal sources of demand for those hotels remains the international traveler for both Booking.com and for Agoda, the international traveler in the APAC region. I think we're doing reasonably well selling international destinations to Chinese travelers because we have, at least in our view, some of the best product out there for them. The purely domestic traveler is something that's still -- is an opportunity that's -- we're not deeply penetrated in. We have some business. We're working on it.

Some of those properties are not hotels, they're B&Bs and vacation apartments and the like. So as I've mentioned previously, it's not the same as adding a hotel that's got 1,000 rooms in it or something, but it provides additional accommodations for customers and adds value to the platform. So we continue to find properties and accommodations to bring on to the website. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question, availability continues to be very important, but there's a lot of very big regions outside of Europe where we've got some substantial hotel staff for both Booking.com and Agoda signing up new hotels and new properties. So I do think that the growth that we've been able to demonstrate in the Booking.com hotel platform has been pretty impressive over the last year, at least in our opinion, despite having been at this in the European market for many, many years and successfully so. With respect to the increase in paid traffic, any online consumer-facing business would love for all of the customers to come directly to our website without going anywhere else first, and so we try very hard to build our strong brands and an outstanding user experience so that, if we have to pay for a customer once, we have a very good chance of getting them back directly. And our data shows we do a pretty good job of driving repeat business. Having said that, paid channels in the online world provide measurable and attractive way to access new customers and so we'd like to see the business grow in paid channels. And in fact, it's critical to the growth of our business around the world that we continue to do well in paid channels. If you look at the thing that's driving the biggest part of the mix that Dan mentioned, it's really the fact that the international business, which really is in online brands, or our all online brands, are going faster than the domestic business. And at the very highest level, that's something that we're very happy about because it's building franchise value and building our earnings."

Not only are our major competitors there and effectively so, there are a lot of local businesses that are our solid competitors too in the search marketplace. So we don't feel like we're operating in a market that doesn't have solid competition in it today. And based on the public pronouncements of Expedia in particular, I think they have been very aggressive in Asia over the last couple of years, and I would expect them to continue to be so. The critical element in all of this is that, in order for somebody to advertise, though, they have to have something to sell and they have to have a website and a consumer proposition that converts because you can spend all the money in the world but that's not a guarantee that the customer actually buys something when they get to your website. And I think that's the challenge that we all face when we go into a new market.

That could have a potentially significant impact on our operating leverage. But besides that, the other factors are not quite as dramatic. We've had some ramp-up in personnel to make sure that we're able to handle the current size of the business and future expected growth. We've opened some new offices. We've invested in IT and we've had increased depreciation expense. So those are other items that contribute to pressure on operating margins.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $7.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year or about 36% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $405 million or $7.85 per share, up 43% versus prior year. Second quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $7.37 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 50.2 million for the quarter, up 39% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 44% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 58% in Q1. Growth rates were negatively impacted by declines in ADRs, further slowing of growth in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Southern Europe where economic conditions seem weaker and a difficult comp with 79% local currency international bookings growth last year. Growth rates benefited from continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com’s platform now has over 235,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 52% over last year. With a relevantly larger concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions, decelerating growth in those markets has impacted overall growth rates. Nevertheless the absolute transaction in local currency growth rates in Europe and non-Euro markets for Q2 were in our view impressive and attested the vitality and potential of the business.
That said, deteriorating overall economic trends and headline risks surrounding the Euro crisis do cause us to be guarded in our near-term outlook. We also announced today the Booking.com signed an agreement with Ctrip.com, China’s leading travel service enterprise under which Ctrip is adding Booking.com’s global portfolio of participating hotels to Ctrip’s hotel reservation service. We are excited about the opportunity to work with Ctrip and make Booking.com’s global collection of hotels available to Ctrip customers. We believe that this will give Booking.com a new way to serve travelers from the Asia Pacific region.
Agoda continues to expand its network of hotels and is building distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market that can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world, over proprietary merchant inventory and access to the worldwide inventory of Booking.com.
Priceline’s domestic gross bookings grew 5% in the second quarter due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by higher ADRs, and growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. Name Your Own Price services experienced challenges relating to supply for air and rental car. In hotels, Name Your Own Price faced increased competition in the discount space and a more challenging user experience from mobile devices often used for last minute bookings.
We recently launched Express Deals, a published-price opaque service that offers great savings to provide greater consumer choice and we will work towards optimal promotion of that option. Merchant gross bookings growth of 23% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com was also the primary drive of the Group’s 29% growth in rental car days.
We believe the Group’s businesses performed well in the second quarter given poor economic conditions, particularly in our core European markets. We are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansion and supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review.

I’ll discuss some of the highlights on operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q2 gross bookings grew by 27% or 36% on a local currency basis led by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 39% in the second quarter, a deceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q1. As I said when we gave guidance for Q2 back in May, we expected fairly significant deceleration in unit growth over the back half of the quarter, given the size of the business and a difficult year-over-year comp.
We believe that weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns further contributed to the level of deceleration experience, particularly in our key European markets which represents about 60% of our total booked room nights. We saw a softer demand and ADR trends continue in Southern Europe and spread to certain other markets including the U.K. in the second quarter. Despite these challenges, our room nights booked grew in Q2 by over 30% in Europe and by over 50% for the rest of the world. We are proud of the results delivered for the quarter from a top line and bottom line perspective and believe that Q2 was another in a long stream of quarters where we grew our market share with booked room nights both in the U.S. and internationally.
We believe that the strong growth rates in markets outside of Europe demonstrates the attractive long-term opportunity that these markets continued to shift the booking online and comprised an increasing share of our business. Average daily rates or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and were up by over 4% for our U.S. hotel service for Q2 2012. These results were slightly below our guidance assumption.
FX rates for the second quarter for the euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar were unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 11% and 3% respectively and in both cases were about 3% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in the U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue and gross profit and also negatively impacted our actual growth rates for these line items compared to our guidance for the quarter.
Our Q2 international gross bookings grew by 33%, and by 44% on a local currency basis, in both cases within our guidance range. Rental car days booked were up by 29% driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. Gross bookings growth for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S. of 5%, we get the bottom end of our range of guidance.
Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs as well as strong growth in retail rental car bookings were key drivers in year-over-year growth. However each of our Name Your Own Price businesses had a challenging quarter posting decreases in year-over-year unit costs. We believe our Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined likely as a result of continued presence of competitive discount hotel initiatives and the emphasis on no bidding offerings in our offline advertising. We launched Express Deals during the quarter which allowed customers to enjoy substantial savings with the posted price. We believe that Express Deals will appeal to customers who want to save money but are not comfortable with the bidding process.
We’re still in the early stages and we intend to continue to experiment with various ways to operate Express Deals to customers on Priceline.com in coming quarters. Airline tickets booked were down by 2%, while average retail ticket prices were up by 7%. Name Your Own Price tickets declined to a greater extent to the limited supply resulting from airline capacity cuts. Name Your Own Price rental car days booked were down significantly due to limited availability of discount and supply and low retail prices that lessened the relative value proposition of our Name Your Own Price offering.
The decrease in our Name Your Own Price businesses has a more pronounced impact on revenue, and merchant revenue in particular, since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue, with supplier cost reported in cost of revenue while our other merchant businesses principally Agota.com and Rentalcars.com are recorded in revenue net of supplier cost.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1 billion and grew 34%, as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $859 million, which constituted an increase of 40% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 53% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $145 million, which represented 6% growth versus prior year. Operating leverage improved in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 48.2% for Q2 2012, expanding by 200 basis points compared to the prior year as expenses grew at a slower pace than gross profit.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast as the prior year partly due to deceleration in gross bookings which resulted in slower growth in advertising. Fundamental advertising efficiency was good, partly offset by the continued mix shift to paid channels. Gross profit decelerated to a lesser degree because strong Q1 gross bookings growth benefits Q2 as gross profit is recognized upon completion of travel.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $495 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $450 million to $470 million and represents 42% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 43%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $432 million of cash from operations during the second quarter of 2012, which represents a 93% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter benefits from our decision to prepay in the first quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year and so second quarter and subsequent quarters of 2012 have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $15 million on CapEx in the quarter and spent about $61 million to purchase a portion of the non-controlling interest related to Rentalcars.com. As of June 30, 2012 our cash and investments totaling $3.9 billion are available for general corporate purposes including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.
Now for third quarter 2012 guidance. Let me start off with some qualitative comments regarding our approach to the Q3 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectation for sequentially naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. It also reflects the significant drag of growth expressed in U.S. dollars for all lines of our income statements presented by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to last year particularly as it relates to the Euro.
Lastly, our forecast reflects our assumptions regarding impact of worldwide macroeconomic conditions in general and in Europe in particular. With several quarters now, we’ve noted weaker transaction growth rates in ADR trends for certain southern European countries and we see evidence of these trends spreading to other markets including the U.K. Our forecasts assumes that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate further as we progress throughout this quarter and that our unit growth rates will decelerate fairly significantly compared to their current levels as a result.
We’ve seen a few quarters now of softening local currency ADR trends for our international hotel business with ADRs up 2% in Q1 and down 1% in Q2. Our Q3 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the second quarter. And net ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 4%. Softer international ADRs and higher cancel rates assumed in our guidance negatively impact unit economics and operating leverage.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 10% to 18%, tend to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 19% to 27% with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 5%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 12% to 20% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 23% to 31%. Our Q3 forecasts assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.24 per euro and $1.56 per British pound as yesterday’s closing rates which will result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 13% for the euro and by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 15% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 15% to 25%. We expect de-leverage and non-GAAP operating income as a percent of gross profit.
We assume that margins in Q3 will be impacted by de-leverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and assumed deterioration in unit economics associated with worsening macro conditions. Despite economic challenges we also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
In addition, our forecast for personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $690 million and $765 million, which at the midpoint represents 13% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $12.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q3 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.4%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full-year 2012 cash income tax rate will be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon yesterday’s closing stock price of $665.12. We forecast GAAP EPS of $10.21 to $11.21 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions particularly in Europe where much of our business is concentrated the variability around our guidance is greater than as usually the case. We will now take your questions.

These events that take place in one market across our broad diversified worldwide business don’t generally have impact that we can discern. To the extent that more people are traveling to London or not traveling to London, perhaps they are traveling somewhere else, so we don’t see anything there.
In terms of the growth assumptions, we said that our forecast reflects the actual results we’ve seen to-date and we’re assuming fairly significant deceleration growth rates from here on - over concern about macroeconomic conditions and our worry that conditions will worsen particularly in Europe which is such a key market for us.

So that’s really what drives us to attribute a portion of the deceleration in this business to economic conditions. And we also see occupancy and ADR trends that are supportive of the deceleration at least in part being tied to macroeconomic conditions.
Now we’ve been guiding investors for a long time to look for deceleration in the business given the size of the business and given the very, very strong comps that we have in the last year and so we think that that’s something that the market should continue to expect all things being equal from an economic perspective.
As far as we can tell as we look at the reported results that our competitors released and our own results, we continued in the second quarter to gain share against our competition in the major markets in which operate. I think that the competition has had a better result from the last couple of quarters and I think that’s due to good execution on their part and I think is demonstrative of the opportunity - the substantial opportunity we have in these marketplaces that you can have a couple of businesses of our size growing at impressive rates.

With respect to the second question, I referred in my remarks to the potential difficulty for a last minute traveler using a bid process where you may have to go through a couple of iterations to get a completed transaction. And that’s something that I think we believe to be the case notwithstanding the fact that the growth of our Name Your Own Price business in places like the Hotel Negotiator App has been great and it’s been quite successful in an absolute sense.
We feel there is an opportunity not just in our opaque products but across the Board to introduce new products in the mobile channel, try to make them very easy for consumers to complete a commercial transaction. And Express Deals is one way where they can get the kind of savings that they are used to with the bidding process without having to go through that, especially if you’re dealing with a small screen and potentially a last minute transaction.

So you can assume that we had good ROIs during the quarter in comparison to prior year. The overall advertising efficiency when you just look at online advertising as a percentage of gross profit was largely driven however by the deceleration in the business, particularly in the back half of the quarter so you have less gross bookings coming through. You’ve got the stronger growth rates at the beginning of the quarter and the prior quarter converting into gross profit this quarter.
And so anytime you got deceleration in gross bookings typically the deceleration in gross profit lags that and so you get a benefit on that line item in terms of operating leverage.
In terms of Booking.com in North America, we don’t disclose that stat but we’ve said for a while now and I’ll say it again that North America is one of the faster growing markets for Booking.com to continue to add properties and performed very well in the market and we’re very pleased with the progress that they’ve made.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $7.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year or about 36% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $405 million or $7.85 per share, up 43% versus prior year. Second quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $7.37 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 50.2 million for the quarter, up 39% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 44% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 58% in Q1. Growth rates were negatively impacted by declines in ADRs, further slowing of growth in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Southern Europe where economic conditions seem weaker and a difficult comp, with 79% local currency international bookings growth last year. Growth rates benefited from continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com’s platform now has over 235,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 52% over the last year. With a relevantly larger concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions, decelerating growth in those markets has impacted overall growth rates. Nevertheless the absolute transaction in local currency growth rates in Europe and non-Euro markets for Q2 were in our view impressive and attested the vitality and potential of the business.
That said, deteriorating overall economic trends and headline risks surrounding the Euro crisis do cause us to be guarded in our near-term outlook. We also announced today that Booking.com signed an agreement with Ctrip.com, China’s leading travel service enterprise under which Ctrip is adding Booking.com’s global portfolio of participating hotels to Ctrip’s hotel reservation service. We are excited about the opportunity to work with Ctrip and make Booking.com’s global collection of hotels available to Ctrip customers. We believe that this will give Booking.com a new way to serve travelers from the Asia Pacific region.
Agoda continues to expand its network of hotels and is building distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market and can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world, over proprietary merchant inventory and access to the worldwide inventory of Booking.com.
Priceline’s domestic gross bookings grew 5% in the second quarter due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by higher ADRs, and growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. Name Your Own Price services experienced challenges relating to supply for air and rental car. In hotels, Name Your Own Price faced increased competition in the discount space and a more challenging user experience from mobile devices often used for last-minute bookings.
We recently launched Express Deals, a published-price opaque service that offers great savings to provide greater consumer choice and we will work towards optimal promotion of that option. Merchant gross bookings growth of 23% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com was also the primary drive of the Group’s 29% growth in rental car days.
We believe the Group’s businesses performed well in the second quarter given poor economic conditions, particularly in our core European markets. We are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansion and supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,213804160,341309,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2012",2012-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

I’ll discuss some of the highlights on operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q2 gross bookings grew by 27% or 36% on a local currency basis led by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 39% in the second quarter, a deceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q1. As I said when we gave guidance for Q2 back in May, we expected fairly significant deceleration in unit growth over the back half of the quarter, given the size of the business and a difficult year-over-year comp.
We believe that weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns further contributed to the level of deceleration experience, particularly in our key European market, which represents about 60% of our total booked room nights. We saw a softer demand and ADR trends continue in Southern Europe and spread to certain other markets including the U.K. in the second quarter. Despite these challenges, our room nights booked grew in Q2 by over 30% in Europe and by over 50% for the rest of the world. We are proud of the results delivered for the quarter from a top line and bottom line perspective and believe that Q2 was another in a long stream of quarters where we grew our market share with booked room nights both in the U.S. and internationally.
We believe that the strong growth rates in markets outside of Europe demonstrates the attractive long-term opportunity that these markets continued to shift the booking online and comprised an increasing share of our business. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and were up by over 4% for our U.S. hotel service for Q2 2012. These results were slightly below our guidance assumption.
FX rates for the second quarter for the euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar were unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 11% and 3% respectively, and in both cases were about 3% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in the U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue and gross profit and also negatively impacted our actual growth rates for these line items compared to our guidance for the quarter.
Our Q2 international gross bookings grew by 33%, and by 44% on a local currency basis, in both cases within our guidance range. Rental car days booked were up by 29% driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. Gross bookings growth for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S. of 5%; we were at the bottom end of our range of guidance.
Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs as well as strong growth in retail rental car bookings were key drivers in year-over-year growth. However each of our Name Your Own Price businesses had a challenging quarter posting decreases in year-over-year unit costs. We believe our Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined likely as a result of continued presence of competitive discount hotel initiatives and the emphasis on no bidding offerings in our offline advertising. We launched Express Deals during the quarter which allowed customers to enjoy substantial savings with the posted price. We believe that Express Deals will appeal to customers who want to save money, but are not comfortable with the bidding process.
We’re still in the early stages and we intend to continue to experiment with various ways to operate Express Deals to customers on Priceline.com in coming quarters. Airline tickets booked were down by 2%, while average retail ticket prices were up by 7%. Name Your Own Price tickets declined to a greater extent to the limited supply resulting from airline capacity cuts. Name Your Own Price rental car days booked were down significantly due to limited availability of discount and supply, and low retail prices that lessened the relative value proposition of our Name Your Own Price offering.
The decrease in our Name Your Own Price businesses has a more pronounced impact on revenue, and merchant revenue in particular, since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue, with supplier cost reported in cost of revenue while our other merchant businesses principally Agota.com and Rentalcars.com are recorded in revenue net of supplier cost.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1 billion and grew 34%, as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $859 million, which constituted an increase of 40% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 53% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $145 million, which represented 6% growth versus prior year. Operating leverage improved in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 48.2% for Q2 2012, expanding by 200 basis points compared to the prior year as expenses grew at a slower pace than gross profit.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast as the prior year partly due to deceleration in gross bookings which resulted in slower growth in advertising. Fundamental advertising efficiency was good, partly offset by the continued mix shift to paid channels. Gross profit decelerated to a lesser degree because strong Q1 gross bookings growth benefits Q2 as gross profit is recognized upon completion of travel.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $495 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $450 million to $470 million and represents 42% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 43%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $432 million of cash from operations during the second quarter of 2012, which represents a 93% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter benefits from our decision to prepay in the first quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year, and so second quarter and subsequent quarters of 2012 have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $15 million on CapEx in the quarter and spent about $61 million to purchase a portion of the non-controlling interest related to Rentalcars.com. As of June 30, 2012, our cash and investments totaling $3.9 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.
Now for third quarter 2012 guidance. Let me start off with some qualitative comments regarding our approach to the Q3 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectation for sequentially, naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. It also reflects the significant drag of growth expressed in U.S. dollars for all lines of our income statements presented by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the Euro.
Lastly, our forecast reflects our assumptions regarding impact of worldwide macroeconomic conditions in general, and in Europe in particular. With several quarters now, we’ve noted weaker transaction growth rates in ADR trends for certain southern European countries and we see evidence of these trends spreading to other markets, including the U.K. Our forecasts assumes that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate further as we progress throughout this quarter and that our unit growth rates will decelerate fairly significantly compared to their current levels as a result.
We’ve seen a few quarters now of softening local currency ADR trends for our international hotel business, with ADRs up 2% in Q1 and down 1% in Q2. Our Q3 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the second quarter. And net ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 4%. Softer international ADRs and higher cancel rates assumed in our guidance negatively impact unit economics and operating leverage.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow about 10% to 18%, tending to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 19% to 27% with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 5%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 12% to 20% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 23% to 31%. Our Q3 forecasts assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.24 per euro and $1.56 per British pound at yesterday’s closing rates, which will result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 13% for the euro and by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 15% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 15% to 25%. We expect de-leverage and non-GAAP operating income as a percent of gross profit.
We assume that margins in Q3 will be impacted by de-leverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and assumed deterioration in unit economics associated with worsening macro conditions. Despite economic challenges we also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
In addition, our forecast for personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $690 million and $765 million, which at the midpoint represents 13% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $12.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q3 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.4%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full-year 2012 cash income tax rate to be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon yesterday’s closing stock price of $665.12. We forecast GAAP EPS of $10.21 to $11.21 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe, where much of our business is concentrated, the variability around our guidance is greater than as usually the case. We will now take your questions."

So that’s really what drives us to attribute a portion of the deceleration in this business to economic conditions. And we also see occupancy and ADR trends that are supportive of the deceleration, at least, in part being tied to macroeconomic conditions.
Now we’ve been guiding investors for a long time to look for deceleration in the business given the size of the business and given the very, very strong comps that we have in the last year and so we think that that’s something that the market should continue to expect, all things being equal, from an economic perspective.
As far as we can tell as we look at the reported results that our competitors released and our own results, we continued in the second quarter to gain share against our competition in the major markets in which operate. I think that the competition has had a better result from the last couple of quarters and I think that’s due to good execution on their part and I think it's  demonstrative of the opportunity - the substantial opportunity we have in these marketplaces, that you can have a couple of businesses of our size growing at impressive rates."

We want to make sure that we have an opportunity to put products and product customers that are compelling, whether they want to bid or not, Tonight-Only is a great product that allows customers to save on disclosed hotels. This is not an opaque product. It’s pricing available only for tonight.
We also offer retail, which in many cases is what the consumer is looking for. So our aim is to promote the most attractive products to the widest group of consumers and Express Deals should fit nicely into that. We really view mobile as more of an opportunity for the group rather than a challenge. We’ve got the best hotel inventory, both published-price and discounted of any OTA in the world. And a great opportunity with good execution to present that in a way that’s compelling to mobile users.
So I don’t want you to misunderstand the opportunity that we have with Express Deals by thinking that mobile is somehow a challenge. We really view it as a great opportunity."

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $7.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year or about 36% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $405 million or $7.85 per share, up 43% versus prior year. Second quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $7.37 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were 50.2 million for the quarter, up 39% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 44% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 58% in Q1. Growth rates were negatively impacted by declines in ADRs, further slowing of growth in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Southern Europe where economic conditions seem weaker and a difficult comp, with 79% local currency international bookings growth last year. Growth rates benefited from continued high growth rates in APAC and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com’s platform now has over 235,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 52% over the last year. With a relevantly larger concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions, decelerating growth in those markets has impacted overall growth rates. Nevertheless the absolute transaction in local currency growth rates in Europe and non-Euro markets for Q2 were in our view impressive and attested the vitality and potential of the business.
That said, deteriorating overall economic trends and headline risks surrounding the Euro crisis do cause us to be guarded in our near-term outlook. We also announced today that Booking.com signed an agreement with Ctrip.com, China’s leading travel service enterprise under which Ctrip is adding Booking.com’s global portfolio of participating hotels to Ctrip’s hotel reservation service. We are excited about the opportunity to work with Ctrip and make Booking.com’s global collection of hotels available to Ctrip customers. We believe that this will give Booking.com a new way to serve travelers from the Asia Pacific region.
Agoda continues to expand its network of hotels and is building distribution as the business scales. They have a significant opportunity in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market and can also help APAC customers with their travel to other parts of the world, over proprietary merchant inventory and access to the worldwide inventory of Booking.com.
Priceline’s domestic gross bookings grew 5% in the second quarter due primarily to growth in retail hotel room night gross bookings aided by higher ADRs, and growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. Name Your Own Price services experienced challenges relating to supply for air and rental car. In hotels, Name Your Own Price faced increased competition in the discount space and a more challenging user experience from mobile devices often used for last-minute bookings.
We recently launched Express Deals, a published-price opaque service that offers great savings to provide greater consumer choice and we will work towards optimal promotion of that option. Merchant gross bookings growth of 23% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com was also the primary drive of the Group’s 29% growth in rental car days.
We believe the Group’s businesses performed well in the second quarter given poor economic conditions, particularly in our core European markets. We are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansion and supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I’ll discuss some of the highlights on operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q2 gross bookings grew by 27% or 36% on a local currency basis led by our worldwide hotel reservation business. Hotel room nights booked grew by 39% in the second quarter, a deceleration compared to the 47% growth rate achieved in Q1. As I said when we gave guidance for Q2 back in May, we expected fairly significant deceleration in unit growth over the back half of the quarter, given the size of the business and a difficult year-over-year comp.
We believe that weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns further contributed to the level of deceleration experience, particularly in our key European market, which represents about 60% of our total booked room nights. We saw a softer demand and ADR trends continue in Southern Europe and spread to certain other markets including the U.K. in the second quarter. Despite these challenges, our room nights booked grew in Q2 by over 30% in Europe and by over 50% for the rest of the world. We are proud of the results delivered for the quarter from a top line and bottom line perspective and believe that Q2 was another in a long stream of quarters where we grew our market share with booked room nights both in the U.S. and internationally.
We believe that the strong growth rates in markets outside of Europe demonstrates the attractive long-term opportunity that these markets continued to shift the booking online and comprised an increasing share of our business. Average daily rates, or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and were up by over 4% for our U.S. hotel service for Q2 2012. These results were slightly below our guidance assumption.
FX rates for the second quarter for the euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar were unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 11% and 3% respectively, and in both cases were about 3% unfavorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in the U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue and gross profit and also negatively impacted our actual growth rates for these line items compared to our guidance for the quarter.
Our Q2 international gross bookings grew by 33%, and by 44% on a local currency basis, in both cases within our guidance range. Rental car days booked were up by 29% driven mainly by strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business. Gross bookings growth for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S. of 5%; we were at the bottom end of our range of guidance.
Strong growth in retail hotel room nights booked and higher ADRs as well as strong growth in retail rental car bookings were key drivers in year-over-year growth. However each of our Name Your Own Price businesses had a challenging quarter posting decreases in year-over-year unit costs. We believe our Name Your Own Price hotel room nights declined likely as a result of continued presence of competitive discount hotel initiatives and the emphasis on no bidding offerings in our offline advertising. We launched Express Deals during the quarter which allowed customers to enjoy substantial savings with the posted price. We believe that Express Deals will appeal to customers who want to save money, but are not comfortable with the bidding process.
We’re still in the early stages and we intend to continue to experiment with various ways to operate Express Deals to customers on Priceline.com in coming quarters. Airline tickets booked were down by 2%, while average retail ticket prices were up by 7%. Name Your Own Price tickets declined to a greater extent to the limited supply resulting from airline capacity cuts. Name Your Own Price rental car days booked were down significantly due to limited availability of discount and supply, and low retail prices that lessened the relative value proposition of our Name Your Own Price offering.
The decrease in our Name Your Own Price businesses has a more pronounced impact on revenue, and merchant revenue in particular, since these transactions are recorded gross in revenue, with supplier cost reported in cost of revenue while our other merchant businesses principally Agota.com and Rentalcars.com are recorded in revenue net of supplier cost.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1 billion and grew 34%, as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $859 million, which constituted an increase of 40% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 53% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $145 million, which represented 6% growth versus prior year. Operating leverage improved in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 48.2% for Q2 2012, expanding by 200 basis points compared to the prior year as expenses grew at a slower pace than gross profit.
Advertising efficiency was favorable to our forecast as the prior year partly due to deceleration in gross bookings which resulted in slower growth in advertising. Fundamental advertising efficiency was good, partly offset by the continued mix shift to paid channels. Gross profit decelerated to a lesser degree because strong Q1 gross bookings growth benefits Q2 as gross profit is recognized upon completion of travel.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $495 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $450 million to $470 million and represents 42% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 43%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $432 million of cash from operations during the second quarter of 2012, which represents a 93% increase versus prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter benefits from our decision to prepay in the first quarter $166 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year, and so second quarter and subsequent quarters of 2012 have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $15 million on CapEx in the quarter and spent about $61 million to purchase a portion of the non-controlling interest related to Rentalcars.com. As of June 30, 2012, our cash and investments totaling $3.9 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.
Now for third quarter 2012 guidance. Let me start off with some qualitative comments regarding our approach to the Q3 guidance. Our guidance reflects our expectation for sequentially, naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates in each quarter of 2011. It also reflects the significant drag of growth expressed in U.S. dollars for all lines of our income statements presented by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the Euro.
Lastly, our forecast reflects our assumptions regarding impact of worldwide macroeconomic conditions in general, and in Europe in particular. With several quarters now, we’ve noted weaker transaction growth rates in ADR trends for certain southern European countries and we see evidence of these trends spreading to other markets, including the U.K. Our forecasts assumes that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate further as we progress throughout this quarter and that our unit growth rates will decelerate fairly significantly compared to their current levels as a result.
We’ve seen a few quarters now of softening local currency ADR trends for our international hotel business, with ADRs up 2% in Q1 and down 1% in Q2. Our Q3 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the second quarter. And net ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 4%. Softer international ADRs and higher cancel rates assumed in our guidance negatively impact unit economics and operating leverage.
We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow about 10% to 18%, tending to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 19% to 27% with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 5%. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 12% to 20% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 23% to 31%. Our Q3 forecasts assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.24 per euro and $1.56 per British pound at yesterday’s closing rates, which will result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 13% for the euro and by 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 15% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 15% to 25%. We expect de-leverage and non-GAAP operating income as a percent of gross profit.
We assume that margins in Q3 will be impacted by de-leverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and assumed deterioration in unit economics associated with worsening macro conditions. Despite economic challenges we also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.
In addition, our forecast for personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $690 million and $765 million, which at the midpoint represents 13% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $12.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $4 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q3 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March and the revolving credit facility we entered in September last year.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16.4%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. We expect our full-year 2012 cash income tax rate to be approximately 4 to 6 percentage points lower than what it would have been if we did not have the Innovation Box Tax benefit.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.5 million shares based upon yesterday’s closing stock price of $665.12. We forecast GAAP EPS of $10.21 to $11.21 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe, where much of our business is concentrated, the variability around our guidance is greater than as usually the case. We will now take your questions."

So that’s really what drives us to attribute a portion of the deceleration in this business to economic conditions. And we also see occupancy and ADR trends that are supportive of the deceleration, at least, in part being tied to macroeconomic conditions.
Now we’ve been guiding investors for a long time to look for deceleration in the business given the size of the business and given the very, very strong comps that we have in the last year and so we think that that’s something that the market should continue to expect, all things being equal, from an economic perspective.
As far as we can tell as we look at the reported results that our competitors released and our own results, we continued in the second quarter to gain share against our competition in the major markets in which operate.

I will make some opening remarks and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $7.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year or about 34% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $638 million or $12.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $11.82 per share and our guidance for the quarter. 
Worldwide hotel-room night reservations were $55.2 million for the quarter, up 36% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 41% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 44% in the second quarter. Hotel-room night growth rates in the second half of the quarter were better than forecast, particularly in Europe where generally our forecast for further significant deceleration proved conservative.
Growth rates benefited from continued high-growth rates in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 245,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 44% over last year. Booking.com's growth has held up well despite the concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions. Absolute transaction in the local currency growth rates in Europe and non-Euro markets maintained solid momentum during the quarter and we believe continued to gain market share.
Our goal to deliver another quarter of strong of room night growth and continuous building supply and distribution. Our goal is building scale in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market as the destination and as a site where APAC customers can book hotels in other parts of the world.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 7% in the third quarter due primarily to  growth in retail airline ticket and hotel room night gross bookings aided by higher ticket prices and ADRs, as well as growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. The trailing 12-month gross bookings for priceline.com were $5 billion, an important milestone for the business. priceline.com has launched Express Deals in a number of exciting mobile services. Transactional business and its mobile services are growing rapidly and continuous innovation is helping drive this momentum. Merchant gross bookings growth of 24% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com.
Growth in rental car days increased sequentially from 29% to 35%, driven by improved results at priceline.com and strong growth at Rentalcars.com.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter showing resilience in the face of weak economic conditions in major markets. We did see pressure on operating margins in the third quarter, though not to the degree forecast, and expect that pressure to continue in Q4. This is driven primarily by investments in marketing and people as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth even if those expenditures create pressure on operating leverage.
The business continues to support this type of investment and the achievement of attractive operating margins. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansions supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition.
I want to finish with a final note about Hurricane Sandy, which has had a large impact of those of us in the northeast, including many of you on this call, and we thank you for participating when you may be dealing with power outages and damage to property.
Our teams are working very hard with our suppliers to serve customers whose travel plans have been interrupted and I thank them for their dedication and we reach all those affected by the storm with speedy recovery.
It is too early to quantify precisely the impact of the storm on our business. New York City, which is an important destination for Booking.com and priceline.com, will be substantially disrupted for many days with reduced bookings and high cancellations. Having said that, given that most of our business is for travel to international destinations, our best estimate that this time is with negative effect of Hurricane Sandy look forward in the range of our guidance for the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012.
Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Our guidance forecast for Q3 was based upon actual results for Q2 and Q3 actual results through when we recorded on August 7. Our room night growth rate had decelerated from 47% in Q1 to 39% in Q2. We have seen weaker transaction growth rates and ADRs trends continue for certain Southern European countries and we have seen evidence of these trends spreading to other markets, including the U.K.
As a result, our forecast for Q3 assumed that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate further throughout the quarter and that our unit growth rates would decelerate fairly significantly. We were pleasantly surprised to see conditions in Europe stabilize, at least for the time being. While softer demand and ADR trends continue to in certain Southern European countries, our unit growth rate in the U.K. improved in Q3.
Overall, hotel room nights booked grew by 36% in the third quarter, a modest deceleration compared to the 39% growth rate achieved in Q2. This strong performance for our worldwide hotel reservation business drove Q3 gross bookings growth of 25% or 34% on a local currency basis.
Average daily rates or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and are up by about 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2012. In both cases, slightly better than our guidance assumption.
FX rates for the third quarter for the Euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar are unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 12% and 2%, respectively. And in both cases, are slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance.
As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and net income. In summary, solid unit growth rates combined with modest favorability to our guidance assumptions for ADRs and FX rates drove actual and operating results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range in all key operating metrics.
Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 30% and by 41% on a local currency basis. Rental car days booked were up by 35% accelerating compared to the Q2 growth rate of 29%. The performance was driven by continued strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business, as well as improved performance for our Priceline U.S. rental car business.
Gross bookings grew by 7% for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. Strong growth in retail hotel room, airline ticket and rental car reservations together with higher ADRs and air ticket prices were key drivers for year-over-year growth. However, each of our price services posted year-over-year decreases in gross bookings in revenues as a result of the continued pressure from competitive discount hotel initiatives and limited availability to discounted rates for airline ticket and rental car days.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 27% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.2 billion, which constituted an increase of 31% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 42% on a local currency basis.
Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $152 million which represented 3% growth versus prior year. The delta between the U.S. gross bookings growth rate of 7% and gross profit growth rate of 3% results mainly from 2 items. First and foremost, Q3 gross profit is negatively impacted by a $4.8 million reserve related to an unfavorable hotel margin tax instruction [ph] in Washington, D.C. Second, strong performance in retail airline tickets benefits gross bookings through a greater degree than gross profit.
Operating leverage declined in the quarter, but through a lesser degree than we assumed in our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 55.9% for Q3 2012 compared to 58% for the prior year Q3. Margins were impacted mainly by deleverage in online advertising and personnel expense.
Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to the continued mix shift in our business to paid channel, as well as lower ROIs. While we have seen the trend of mix shift to paid channels impact our advertising efficiency for several quarters, we have recently also experienced pressure on ROIs. although our advertising ROIs were lower compared to prior year, they were better than our guidance because we assumed deterioration in economic conditions did not occur.
Personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3.
We also continued as planned to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support growth of our business. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $781 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $690 million to $765 million, and represents 21% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 25%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory rate tax rate in the U.K..
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $675 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2012, which represents 20% increase versus prior year. We spent about $11 million on CapEx in the quarter.
As of September 30, 2012, our cash and investments totaling $4.7 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments. 
Now for fourth quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 21% to 28% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 22% to 29%. With U.S. gross bookings about flat with the prior year. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow about 27% to 35% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 28% to 36%.
Our Q4 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the third quarter and ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 5%. Our Q4 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per Euro and $1.61 of per British pound at yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 4% for the Euro was stronger by 2% for the British pound as compared to  the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA net earnings for many fluctuations in the Euro or Pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 22% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 26% to 33%. We expect 400 bps to 500 bps of de-leverage of non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to  prior year. We assume that margins in Q4 will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix continuing to shift to pay channels -- paid channels, as well as continuing pressure in our ROIs.
We also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $381 million and $421 million, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth versus prior year.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $6.12 to $6.57 per share, which at the midpoint represents 18% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $3 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q4 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15.6% comprised of international income taxes and minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully paid impact with Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $573.77. We forecast GAAP EPS of $5.39 to $5.84 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the group delivered solid results in the back half of Q3 and that momentum has carried over thus far into Q4. Our guidance reflects actual results to date and reflects our expectation for sequentially naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates.
Our comp is particularly challenging in the latter half of the quarter because we experienced accelerating growth in the back half of Q4 2011. Although we still have very low concerns about economy conditions on a worldwide basis, and in Europe in particular, our forecast does not reflect any potential worsening in macroeconomic conditions.
Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe where much of our business is concentrated and the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy, we believe the variability around our guidance is elevated.

And I think they've done an excellent job of building on the hotel platform at a pretty fast clip, 40-plus percent growth year-over-year. I've said in previous calls that in a lot of cases, we're adding non-hotel accommodations and those properties often have lower room counts than some of the larger hotels. And so there's potentially a diminishing return as you continue to add hotels. But I think you can expect Booking.com and Agoda as well to continue to add properties to their list. Growth rates are driven not just by adding new properties, although that's important, but also by driving greater penetration of existing hotels. And I think given the size of the business that's equally important to hotel counts, when you look at the business and the trends in unit growth, I'd point to not just new hotel counts but also to penetration of existing hotels. And then just to driving fundamental underlying demand, which is also an important driver of momentum in unit growth."

We've talked from time-to-time and we get specific guidance on ADRs so those are down in Q3 year-over-year and we're expecting them to be down further in Q4. So that's not helpful to unit economics. Cancel rates have been climbing for a while. It's one of the benefits of our model for Booking.com is that it's an agency model and it's easy for our customers to cancel their plans change so we do look at that as a net negative as long as our gross bookings growth rate net of cancels continues to climb up in an attractive rate.

As Dan mentioned, a big part of that is the businesses that rely more heavily on online are going growing faster than the U.S. business, which tends to have less reliance on online, so that's just the math of it. it doesn't really have anything to do with the balance of free versus paid traffic. Now there's no question that some of the things that are happening out there in the marketplace and some of the major Pay-Per-Click channels is tending to do a very good job of taking traffic that used to come free through organic search and have that traffic now be paid for through paid search. And that's, if you look at a lot of the changes that have been made by the major search engines, that's been an effort on their part. And I think they're doing that because they believe it drives a good customer experience, but also it's obviously helpful to their financial situation. And from our perspective, we're comfortable with it as long as the ROIs and conversion in those products are attractive which they have been and are for us. We, as Dan said earlier, we can't get into a discussion about the what CPCs are and what conversions is because those really are going to be primarily driven by actions that we're taking in the marketplace to be what reverently more aggressive, less aggressive, what's channels we're in, et cetera. And so we just don't comment on that publicly because it gives people a heads-up as to what we're doing competitively."

With respect to affiliate criteria, I'd say a couple of very broad things. The first is we would tend to value more highly our branded affiliate that has its own product offering and something that customers are coming to the website for reasons that are independent and they have their own loyal customers that's something we would tend to value more highly than, for example, a website that doesn't have a substantial brand and relates primarily on Pay-Per-Click marketing were they'd be competing with us in the same channel or search engine optimization kind of business. So those would be 2 contrasting types of affiliates, one of which we would assign a little bit to a higher value to, and one which we would assign a much lower value to. The second thing I would say is that our approach and that is also driven by our view of what the appropriate economics are for affiliate-type business. Our competition for certain affiliates might be much more aggressive pricing the business to affiliates where we might simply got a pretty good chance of getting bookings directly to our sites where we have big market share and not necessarily have to take inventory, which is then potentially short supply in high season provide that to an affiliate for them to sell it and confer most of the economist to them.

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $7.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year or about 34% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $638 million or $12.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $11.82 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $55.2 million for the quarter, up 36% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 41% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 44% in the second quarter. Hotel room night growth rates in the second half of the quarter were better than forecast, particularly in Europe, where generally our forecast for further significant deceleration proved conservative. Growth rates benefited from continued high-growth rates in Asia Pacific and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 245,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 44% over last year. Booking.com's growth has held up well despite the concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions. Absolute transaction in the local currency growth rates in Europe and non-euro markets maintained solid momentum during the quarter and we believe continued to gain market share.
Agoda delivered another quarter of strong room night growth and continuous building supply and distribution. Agoda is building scale in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market as a destination and as a site where APAC customers can book hotels in other parts of the world.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 7% in the third quarter, due primarily to  growth in retail airline ticket and hotel room night gross bookings, aided by higher ticket prices and ADRs, as well as growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. Trailing 12-month gross bookings for priceline.com were $5 billion, an important milestone for the business. priceline.com has launched Express Deals in a number of exciting mobile services. Transactional business on its mobile services are growing rapidly, and continuous innovation is helping drive this momentum. 
Merchant gross bookings growth of 24% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth in rental car days increased sequentially from 29% to 35%, driven by improved results at priceline.com and strong growth at Rentalcars.com.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter, showing resilience in the face of weak economic conditions in major markets. We did see pressure on operating margins in the third quarter, though not to the degree forecast and expect that pressure to continue in Q4. This is driven primarily by investments in marketing and people, as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth even if those expenditures create pressure on operating leverage. The business continues to support this type of investment and the achievement of attractive operating margins. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansion in supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition.
I want to finish with a final note about Hurricane Sandy, which has had a large impact on most of us in the northeast, including many of you on this call, and we thank you for participating when you may be dealing with power outages and damage to property. Our teams are working very hard with our suppliers to serve customers whose travel plans have been interrupted, and I thank them for their dedication. And we wish all those affected by the storm a speedy recovery. 
It is too early to quantify precisely the impact of the storm on our business. New York City, which is an important destination for Booking.com and priceline.com, will be substantially disrupted for many days with reduced bookings and high cancellations. Having said that, given that most of our business is for travel to international destinations, our best estimate at this time is that the negative effect of Hurricane Sandy would fall within the range of our guidance for the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,223516110,376064,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff.

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Our guidance forecast for Q3 was based upon actual results for the Q2 and Q3 actual results through when we reported on August 7. Our room night growth rate had decelerated from 47% in Q1 to 39% in Q2. We have seen weaker transaction growth rates and ADR trends continue for certain Southern European countries. And we have seen evidence of these trends spreading to other markets, including the U.K. As a result, our forecast for Q3 assumed that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate further throughout the quarter and that our unit growth rates would decelerate fairly significantly. We were pleasantly surprised to see conditions in Europe stabilize, at least for the time being. While softer demand and ADR trends continued in certain Southern European countries, our unit growth rate in the U.K. improved in Q3.
Overall, hotel room nights booked grew by 36% in the third quarter, a modest deceleration compared to the 39% growth rate achieved in Q2. This strong performance for our worldwide hotel reservation business drove Q3 gross bookings growth of 25%, or 34% on a local currency basis.
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and were up by about 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2012. In both cases, slightly better than our guidance assumptions.
FX rates for the third quarter for the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar are unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 12% and 2%, respectively. And in both cases, are slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and net income. In summary, solid unit growth rates, combined with modest favorability to our guidance assumptions for ADRs and FX rates, drove actual operating results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range in all key operating metrics.
Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 30%, and by 41% on a local currency basis. Rental car days booked were up by 35%, accelerating compared to the Q2 growth rate of 29%. The performance was driven by continued strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business, as well as improved performance for our Priceline U.S. rental car business. Gross bookings grew by 7% for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. Strong growth in retail hotel room, airline ticket and rental car reservations, together with higher ADRs and air ticket prices, were key drivers in year-over-year growth. However, each of our Name Your Own Price services posted year-over-year decreases in gross bookings and revenues as a result of the continued pressure from competitive discount hotel initiatives and limited availability to discounted rates [ph] for airline tickets and rental car days.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 27% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.2 billion, which constituted an increase of 31% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 42% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $152 million, which represented 3% growth versus prior year. The delta between the U.S. gross bookings growth rate of 7% and gross profit growth rate of 3% results mainly from 2 items. First and foremost, Q3 gross profit is negatively impacted by a $4.8 million reserve related to an unfavorable hotel margin tax judgment in Washington, D.C. Second, strong performance in retail airline tickets benefits gross bookings to a greater degree than gross profit.
Operating leverage declined in the quarter but to a lesser degree than we assumed in our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 55.9% for Q3 2012 compared to 58% for the prior year Q3. Margins were impacted mainly by deleverage in online advertising and personnel expense. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to the continued mix shift in our business to paid channels, as well as lower ROIs. While we have seen the trend of mix shift to paid channels impact our advertising efficiency for several quarters, we have recently also experienced pressure on ROIs. Although our advertising ROIs were lower compared to prior year, they were better than our guidance because the assumed deterioration in economic conditions did not occur. Personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3. We also continued, as planned, to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.  
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $781 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $690 million to $765 million and represents 21% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 25%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory tax rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $675 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2012, which represents 20% increase versus prior year. We spent about $11 million on CapEx in the quarter. As of September 30, 2012, our cash and investments totaling $4.7 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments.  
Now for fourth quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 21% to 28% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 22% to 29%. With U.S. gross bookings about flat with prior year, we expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 27% to 35% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 28% to 36%.
Our Q4 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the third quarter, and ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 5%. Our Q4 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 4% for the euro and stronger by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings for any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We expect Q4 revenues to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 22% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 26% to 33%. We expect 400 bps to 500 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to  prior year. We assume that margins in Q4 will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix continuing to shift to paid channels, as well as continuing pressure on ROIs. We also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $381 million and $421 million, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $6.12 to $6.57 per share, which at the midpoint represents 18% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $3 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q4 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15.6%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $573.77. We forecast GAAP EPS of $5.39 to $5.84 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the group delivered solid results in the back half of Q3, and that momentum is carried over thus far into Q4. Our guidance reflects actual results to date and reflects our expectation for sequentially naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates. Our comp is particularly challenging in the latter half of the quarter because we experienced accelerating growth in the back half of Q4 2011. 
Although we still have very real concerns about economic conditions on a worldwide basis, and in Europe in particular, our forecast does not reflect any potential worsening in macroeconomic conditions. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer or travel market in particular. Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe, where much of our business is concentrated, and the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy, we believe the variability around our guidance is elevated.

And I think they've done an excellent job of building on the hotel platform at a pretty fast clip, 40-plus percent growth year-over-year. I've said in previous calls that in a lot of cases, we're adding non-hotel accommodations, and those properties often have lower room counts than some of the larger hotels. And so there's potentially a diminishing return as you continue to add hotels. But I think you can expect Booking.com and Agoda as well to continue to add properties to their list. Growth rates are driven, not just by adding new properties, although that's important, but also by driving greater penetration of existing hotels. And I think given the size of the business, that's equally important to hotel counts. So when you look at the business and the trends in unit growth, I'd point to not just new hotel counts but also to penetration of existing hotels, and then just to driving fundamental underlying demand, which is also an important driver of momentum in unit growth."

So in terms of online advertising and its impact on deleverage, we've seen for several quarters a continuing trend, where the mix of our business is shifting more to paid channels, and that's just the way people are choosing to access the Internet and find our website. So we are pleased to participate in that in an effective fashion and then still a very important driver of demand for our websites. We saw this past quarters some deterioration trends year-over-year in terms of advertising. ROI is a fundamental efficiency for our brands. We don't get into a lot of the specifics behind that, but you know the drivers are ADRs and year-over-year cancel rates. We've talked from time to time and we give a specific guidance on ADRs, that those are down in Q3 year-over-year, and we're expecting them to be down further in Q4. So that's not helpful to unit economics. Cancel rates have been climbing for a while. It's -- one of the benefits of our model for Booking.com is that it's an agency model, and it's easy for a customer to cancel if their plans change. So we don't look at that as a net negative as long as our gross bookings growth rate net of cancels continues to climb at an attractive rate. And the other factors we've built into that in terms of CPC and conversion rates are more sensitive competitively, and so we don't speak to just what we're seeing there, but those are the other factors that go into that equation. In terms of stock repurchase, we have about $460 million authorized by our Board that we can use to buy back stock. We did buyback in the first quarter of this year about 250 million, if I recall correctly, it's in our Q. And we continue to look from time to time, and we will buy back stock where we think there's an opportunity to do so at attractive prices."

And from our perspective, we're comfortable with it as long as the ROIs and the conversion in those products are attractive, which they have been and are for us. We -- as Dan said earlier, we can't get into a discussion about what CPCs are and what conversion is because those really are going to be primarily driven by actions that we're taking in the marketplace to be relatively more aggressive, less aggressive, what channels we're in, et cetera. And so we just don't comment on that publicly because it gives people a heads-up as to what we're doing competitively."

We look at the various distribution channels that we are active in. And I think we're doing well from a share perspective in those channels. There are some channels that our competition is more aggressive in and I think assigns a higher strategic value to them than maybe we do. And the example I would give you is in sort of in the white label affiliate business. Both Expedia and Orbitz put a lot of effort into that and are very aggressive in going after that business and do a very good job of it. And it's possible that they've gotten some affiliate business that we're not getting. And so that I think is derived from business decisions that they've made and we've made with our eyes open as to what -- how we value relatively the business from that channel. But I think our businesses are performing very well. Having said that, I would also say that we operate in a very attractive space with a lot of running room. And as our competition executes better, there's room for their businesses to perform well. And Expedia had a good quarter, and their growth rate accelerated. And as you look at our growth rates and if you look at how we're behaving competitively in the marketplace, I think it will be disingenuous to say that there was no impact on us. I think we're both competing very aggressively with each other. And I think you have 2 companies that are executing pretty well right now."

With respect to affiliate criteria, I'd say a couple of very broad things. The first is that we tend to value more highly a branded affiliate that has its own product offering and something that customers are coming to the website for reasons that are independent and they have their own loyal customers. That's something we would tend to value more highly than, for example, a website that doesn't have a substantial brand and relies primarily on Pay-Per-Click marketing, where they'd be competing with us in the same channel, or search engine optimization kind of business. So those would be 2 contrasting types of affiliates, one which we would assign a little bit of higher value to and one which we would assign a much lower value to. The second thing I would say is that our approach on that is also driven by our view of what the appropriate economics are for affiliate-type business. Our competition for certain affiliates might be much more aggressive pricing the business to affiliates where we might think we've got a pretty good chance of getting bookings directly to our sites, where we have a big market share and not necessarily have to take inventory, which is then potentially short supply in high season and provide that to an affiliate for them to sell it and confer most of the economics to them. So those are 2 sort of differences that you might find between us and our competition."

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $7.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year or about 34% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $638 million or $12.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $11.82 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $55.2 million for the quarter, up 36% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 41% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 44% in the second quarter. Hotel room night growth rates in the second half of the quarter were better than forecast, particularly in Europe, where generally our forecast for further significant deceleration proved conservative. Growth rates benefited from continued high growth rates in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 245,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 44% over last year. Booking.com's growth has held up well despite the concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions. Absolute transaction in the local currency growth rates in Europe and non-euro markets maintained solid momentum during the quarter and we believe continued to gain market share.
Agoda delivered another quarter of strong room night growth and continues building supply and distribution. Agoda is building scale in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market as a destination and as a site where APAC customers can book hotels in other parts of the world.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 7% in third quarter, due primarily to growth in retail airline ticket and hotel room night gross bookings, aided by higher ticket prices and ADRs, as well as growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. Trailing 12-month gross bookings for priceline.com were $5 billion, an important milestone for the business. priceline.com has launched Express Deals and a number of exciting mobile services. Transactional business on its mobile services are growing rapidly, and continuous innovation is helping drive this momentum. 
Merchant gross bookings growth of 24% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth in rental car days increased sequentially from 29% to 35%, driven by improved results at priceline.com and strong growth at Rentalcars.com.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter, showing resilience in the face of weak economic conditions in major markets. We did see pressure on operating margins in the third quarter, though not to the degree forecast and expect that pressure to continue in Q4. This is driven primarily by investments in marketing and people, as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth even if those expenditures create pressure on operating leverage. The business continues to support this type of investment and the achievement of attractive operating margins. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansion and supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition.
I want to finish with a final note about Hurricane Sandy, which has had a large impact on those of us in the northeast, including many of you on this call, and we thank you for participating when you may be dealing with power outages and damage to property. Our teams are working very hard with our suppliers to serve customers whose travel plans have been interrupted, and I thank them for their dedication. And we wish all those affected by the storm a speedy recovery. 
It is too early to quantify precisely the impact of the storm on our business. New York City, which is an important destination for Booking.com and priceline.com, will be substantially disrupted for many days with reduced bookings and high cancellations. Having said that, given that most of our business is for travel to international destinations, our best estimate at this time is that the negative effect of Hurricane Sandy would fall within the range of our guidance for the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."
33254,223516110,376097,"priceline.com Incorporated, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Booking Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff.

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Our guidance forecast for Q3 was based upon actual results for Q2 and Q3 actual results through when we reported on August 7. Our room night growth rate had decelerated from 47% in Q1 to 39% in Q2. We have seen weaker transaction growth rates and ADR trends continue for certain Southern European countries. And we have seen evidence of these trends spreading to other markets, including the U.K. As a result, our forecast for Q3 assumed that macroeconomic conditions would deteriorate further throughout the quarter and that our unit growth rates would decelerate fairly significantly. We were pleasantly surprised to see conditions in Europe stabilize, at least for the time being. While softer demand and ADR trends continued in certain Southern European countries, our unit growth rate in the U.K. improved in Q3.
Overall, hotel room nights booked grew by 36% in the third quarter, a modest deceleration compared to the 39% growth rate achieved in Q2. This strong performance for our worldwide hotel reservation business drove Q3 gross bookings growth of 25%, or 34% on a local currency basis.
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and were up by about 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2012, in both cases, slightly better than our guidance assumptions.
FX rates for the third quarter for the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar are unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 12% and 2%, respectively and in both cases, are slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and net income. In summary, solid unit growth rates, combined with modest favorability to our guidance assumptions for ADRs and FX rates, drove actual operating results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range in all key operating metrics.
Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 30%, and by 41% on a local currency basis. Rental car days booked were up by 35%, accelerating compared to the Q2 growth rate of 29%. The performance was driven by continued strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business, as well as improved performance for our Priceline U.S. rental car business. Gross bookings grew by 7% for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. Strong growth in retail hotel room, airline ticket and rental car reservations, together with higher ADRs and air ticket prices, were key drivers in year-over-year growth. However, each of our Name Your Own Price services posted year-over-year decreases in gross bookings and revenues as a result of the continued pressure from competitive discount hotel initiatives and limited availability to discounted rates for airline tickets and rental car days.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 27% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.2 billion, which constituted an increase of 31% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 42% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $152 million, which represented 3% growth versus prior year. The delta between the U.S. gross bookings growth rate of 7% and gross profit growth rate of 3% results mainly from 2 items. First and foremost, Q3 gross profit is negatively impacted by a $4.8 million reserve related to an unfavorable hotel margin tax judgment in Washington, D.C. Second, strong performance in retail airline tickets benefits gross bookings to a greater degree than gross profit.
Operating leverage declined in the quarter but to a lesser degree than we assumed in our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 55.9% for Q3 2012 compared to 58% for the prior year Q3. Margins were impacted mainly by deleverage in online advertising and personnel expense. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to the continued mix shift in our business to paid channels, as well as lower ROIs. While we have seen the trend of mix shift to paid channels impact our advertising efficiency for several quarters, we have recently also experienced pressure on ROIs. Although our advertising ROIs were lower compared to prior year, they were better than our guidance because the assumed deterioration in economic conditions did not occur. Personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3. We also continued, as planned, to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.  
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $781 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $690 million to $765 million and represents 21% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 25%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory tax rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $675 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2012, which represents a 20% increase versus prior year. We spent about $11 million on CapEx in the quarter. As of September 30, 2012, our cash and investments totaling $4.7 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment.  
Now for fourth quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow about 21% to 28% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 22% to 29%, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with prior year. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow about 27% to 35% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 28% to 36%.
Our Q4 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the third quarter, and ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 5%. Our Q4 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 4% for the euro and stronger by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We expect Q4 revenues to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 22% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 26% to 33%. We expect 400 bps to 500 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to prior year. We assume that margins in Q4 will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix continuing to shift to paid channels, as well as continuing pressure on ROIs. We also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $381 million and $421 million, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $6.12 to $6.57 per share, which at the midpoint represents 18% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $3 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q4 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15.6% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $573.77. We forecast GAAP EPS of $5.39 to $5.84 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the group delivered solid results in the back half of Q3, and that momentum has carried over thus far into Q4. Our guidance reflects actual results to date and reflects our expectation for sequentially naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates. Our comp is particularly challenging in the latter half of the quarter because we experienced accelerating growth in the back half of Q4 2011. 
Although we still have very real concerns about economic conditions on a worldwide basis, and in Europe in particular, our forecast does not reflect any potential worsening in macroeconomic conditions. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer or travel market in particular. Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe, where much of our business is concentrated, and the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy, we believe the variability around our guidance is elevated.

And I think they've done an excellent job of building on the hotel platform at a pretty fast clip, 40-plus percent growth year-over-year. I've said in previous calls that in a lot of cases, we're adding non-hotel accommodations, and those properties often have lower room counts than some of the larger hotels. And so there's potentially a diminishing return as you continue to add hotels. But I think you can expect Booking.com and Agoda as well to continue to add properties to their list. Growth rates are driven, not just by adding new properties, although that's important, but also by driving greater penetration of existing hotels. And I think given the size of the business, that's equally important to a hotel count. So when you look at the business and the trends in unit growth, I'd point to not just new hotel counts but also to penetration of existing hotels, and then just to driving fundamental underlying demand, which is also an important driver of momentum in unit growth."

So in terms of online advertising and its impact on deleverage, we've seen for several quarters a continuing trend where the mix of our business is shifting more to paid channels, and that's just the way people are choosing to access the Internet and find our website. So we are pleased to participate in that in an effective fashion and then it’s been a very important driver of demand for our websites. We saw this past quarters a deterioration in trends year-over-year in terms of advertising ROI so a fundamental efficiency for our brands. We don't get into a lot of the specifics behind that, but you know the drivers are ADRs and year-over-year cancel rates. We've talked from time-to-time and we give a specific guidance on ADRs, that those are down in Q3 year-over-year, and we're expecting them to be down further in Q4. So that's not helpful to unit economics. Cancel rates have been climbing for a while. It's -- one of the benefits of our model for Booking.com is that it's an agency model, and it's easy for a customer to cancel if their plans change. So we don't look at that as a net negative as long as our gross bookings growth rate net of cancels continues to climb at an attractive rate. And the other factors we've built into that in terms of CPC and conversion rates are more sensitive competitively, and so we don't speak to what we're seeing there, but those are the other factors that go into that equation. In terms of a stock repurchase, we have about $460 million authorized by our board that we can use to buy back stock. We did buyback in the first quarter of this year about $250 million, if I recall correctly; it's in our Q. And we continue to look from time-to-time, and we will buy back stock where we think there's an opportunity to do so at attractive prices."

And there's a very wide spectrum of approaches that companies in our space make to this issue. There are some outstanding companies who operate on very, very narrow margins and throw everything back into the business. That hasn't been our approach.

We look at the various distribution channels that we are active in. And I think we're doing well from a share perspective in those channels. There are some channels that our competition is more aggressive in and I think assigns a higher strategic value to them than maybe we do. And the example I would give you is in sort of in the white label affiliate business. Both Expedia and Orbitz put a lot of effort into that and are very aggressive in going after that business and do a very good job of it. And it's possible that they've gotten some affiliate business that we're not getting. And so that I think is derived from business decisions that they've made and we've made with our eyes open as to what -- how we value, relatively, the business from that channel. But I think our businesses are performing very well. Having said that, I would also say that we operate in a very attractive space with a lot of running room. And as our competition executes better, there's room for their businesses to perform well. And Expedia had a good quarter, and their growth rate accelerated. And as you look at our growth rates and if you look at how we're behaving competitively in the marketplace, I think it would be disingenuous to say that there was no impact on us. I think we're both competing very aggressively with each other. And I think you have 2 companies that are executing pretty well right now."

With respect to affiliate criteria, I'd say a couple of very broad things. The first is that we would tend to value more highly a branded affiliate that has its own product offering and something that customers are coming to the website for reasons that are independent and they have their own loyal customers. That's something that we would tend to value more highly than, for example, a website that doesn't have a substantial brand and relies primarily on Pay-Per-Click marketing where they'd be competing with us in the same channel, or search engine optimization kind of business. So those would be 2 contrasting types of affiliates, one which we would assign a little bit of a higher value to and one which we would assign a much lower value to. The second thing I would say is that our approach on that is also driven by our view of what the appropriate economics are for affiliate-type business. Our competition for certain affiliates might be much more aggressive pricing the business to affiliates where we might think we've got a pretty good chance of getting bookings directly to our sites, where we have big market share and not necessarily have to take inventory, which is in potentially short supply in high season and provide that to an affiliate for them to sell it and confer most of the economics to them. So those are 2 sorts of differences that you might find between us and our competition."

I will make some opening remarks, and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we'll take questions.
Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $7.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year or about 34% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $638 million or $12.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year. Third quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $11.82 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $55.2 million for the quarter, up 36% year-over-year.
Our international business recorded 41% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, down from 44% in the second quarter. Hotel room night growth rates in the second half of the quarter were better than forecast, particularly in Europe, where generally our forecast for further significant deceleration proved conservative. Growth rates benefited from continued high growth rates in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at Rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 245,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 44% over last year. Booking.com's growth has held up well despite the concentration of its business in European countries experiencing weak economic conditions. Absolute transaction in the local currency growth rates in Europe and non-euro markets maintained solid momentum during the quarter and we believe continued to gain market share.
Agoda delivered another quarter of strong room night growth and continues building supply and distribution. Agoda is building scale in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market as a destination and as a site where APAC customers can book hotels in other parts of the world.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 7% in third quarter, due primarily to growth in retail airline ticket and hotel room night gross bookings, aided by higher ticket prices and ADRs, as well as growth in domestic retail rental car reservations. Trailing 12-month gross bookings for priceline.com were $5 billion, an important milestone for the business. priceline.com has launched Express Deals and a number of exciting mobile services. Transactional business on its mobile services are growing rapidly, and continuous innovation is helping drive this momentum. 
Merchant gross bookings growth of 24% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth in rental car days increased sequentially from 29% to 35%, driven by improved results at priceline.com and strong growth at Rentalcars.com.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter, showing resilience in the face of weak economic conditions in major markets. We did see pressure on operating margins in the third quarter, though not to the degree forecast and expect that pressure to continue in Q4. This is driven primarily by investments in marketing and people, as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth even if those expenditures create pressure on operating leverage. The business continues to support this type of investment and the achievement of attractive operating margins. Our aim is to continue building our brands by investing in geographic expansion and supply, product and service innovation and customer acquisition.
I want to finish with a final note about Hurricane Sandy, which has had a large impact on those of us in the northeast, including many of you on this call, and we thank you for participating when you may be dealing with power outages and damage to property. Our teams are working very hard with our suppliers to serve customers whose travel plans have been interrupted, and I thank them for their dedication. And we wish all those affected by the storm a speedy recovery. 
It is too early to quantify precisely the impact of the storm on our business. New York City, which is an important destination for Booking.com and priceline.com, will be substantially disrupted for many days with reduced bookings and high cancellations. Having said that, given that most of our business is for travel to international destinations, our best estimate at this time is that the negative effect of Hurricane Sandy would fall within the range of our guidance for the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review."

I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Our guidance forecast for Q3 was based upon actual results for Q2 and Q3 actual results through when we reported on August 7. Our room night growth rate had decelerated from 47% in Q1 to 39% in Q2. We have seen weaker transaction growth rates and ADR trends continue for certain Southern European countries. And we have seen evidence of these trends spreading to other markets, including the U.K. As a result, our forecast for Q3 assumed that macroeconomic conditions would deteriorate further throughout the quarter and that our unit growth rates would decelerate fairly significantly. We were pleasantly surprised to see conditions in Europe stabilize, at least for the time being. While softer demand and ADR trends continued in certain Southern European countries, our unit growth rate in the U.K. improved in Q3.
Overall, hotel room nights booked grew by 36% in the third quarter, a modest deceleration compared to the 39% growth rate achieved in Q2. This strong performance for our worldwide hotel reservation business drove Q3 gross bookings growth of 25%, or 34% on a local currency basis.
Average daily rates, or ADRs, were down on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for our international hotel service and were up by about 5% for our U.S. hotel service for Q3 2012, in both cases, slightly better than our guidance assumptions.
FX rates for the third quarter for the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar are unfavorable compared to the prior year by about 12% and 2%, respectively and in both cases, are slightly favorable to the rates we assumed in our guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates significantly depressed our year-over-year growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and net income. In summary, solid unit growth rates, combined with modest favorability to our guidance assumptions for ADRs and FX rates, drove actual operating results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range in all key operating metrics.
Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 30%, and by 41% on a local currency basis. Rental car days booked were up by 35%, accelerating compared to the Q2 growth rate of 29%. The performance was driven by continued strong growth for our Rentalcars.com business, as well as improved performance for our Priceline U.S. rental car business. Gross bookings grew by 7% for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. Strong growth in retail hotel room, airline ticket and rental car reservations, together with higher ADRs and air ticket prices, were key drivers in year-over-year growth. However, each of our Name Your Own Price services posted year-over-year decreases in gross bookings and revenues as a result of the continued pressure from competitive discount hotel initiatives and limited availability to discounted rates for airline tickets and rental car days.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 27% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.2 billion, which constituted an increase of 31% as compared to the prior year and an increase of 42% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business amounted to $152 million, which represented 3% growth versus prior year. The delta between the U.S. gross bookings growth rate of 7% and gross profit growth rate of 3% results mainly from 2 items. First and foremost, Q3 gross profit is negatively impacted by a $4.8 million reserve related to an unfavorable hotel margin tax judgment in Washington, D.C. Second, strong performance in retail airline tickets benefits gross bookings to a greater degree than gross profit.
Operating leverage declined in the quarter but to a lesser degree than we assumed in our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit amounted to 55.9% for Q3 2012 compared to 58% for the prior year Q3. Margins were impacted mainly by deleverage in online advertising and personnel expense. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to the continued mix shift in our business to paid channels, as well as lower ROIs. While we have seen the trend of mix shift to paid channels impact our advertising efficiency for several quarters, we have recently also experienced pressure on ROIs. Although our advertising ROIs were lower compared to prior year, they were better than our guidance because the assumed deterioration in economic conditions did not occur. Personnel expense in Q3 includes a $13 million charge related to a reported one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July. We do not expect the impact of this wage levy to be significant beyond Q3. We also continued, as planned, to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business.  
Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $781 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $690 million to $765 million and represents 21% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 25%, including a lower year-over-year cash tax rate due to the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands and a lower statutory tax rate in the U.K.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $675 million of cash from operations during third quarter 2012, which represents a 20% increase versus prior year. We spent about $11 million on CapEx in the quarter. As of September 30, 2012, our cash and investments totaling $4.7 billion are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment.  
Now for fourth quarter 2012 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow about 21% to 28% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 22% to 29%, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with prior year. We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow about 27% to 35% and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 28% to 36%.
Our Q4 forecast assumes ADRs for our international hotel service will be down to a greater degree than in the third quarter, and ADRs for our U.S. hotel service will be up by about 5%. Our Q4 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.30 per euro and $1.61 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by 4% for the euro and stronger by 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We expect Q4 revenues to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 22% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 26% to 33%. We expect 400 bps to 500 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to prior year. We assume that margins in Q4 will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix continuing to shift to paid channels, as well as continuing pressure on ROIs. We also intend to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of our business. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $381 million and $421 million, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $6.12 to $6.57 per share, which at the midpoint represents 18% growth over prior year. Our EPS forecast reflects about $3 million of additional year-over-year cash interest expense for Q4 related to the convertible bonds we issued in March. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15.6% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. This rate reflects the estimated fully phased-in impact of the Innovation Box Tax benefit in the Netherlands. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.4 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $573.77. We forecast GAAP EPS of $5.39 to $5.84 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the group delivered solid results in the back half of Q3, and that momentum has carried over thus far into Q4. Our guidance reflects actual results to date and reflects our expectation for sequentially naturally decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing against high transaction growth rates. Our comp is particularly challenging in the latter half of the quarter because we experienced accelerating growth in the back half of Q4 2011. 
Although we still have very real concerns about economic conditions on a worldwide basis, and in Europe in particular, our forecast does not reflect any potential worsening in macroeconomic conditions. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer or travel market in particular. Given the uncertainties surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe, where much of our business is concentrated, and the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy, we believe the variability around our guidance is elevated.

And I think they've done an excellent job of building on the hotel platform at a pretty fast clip, 40-plus percent growth year-over-year. I've said in previous calls that in a lot of cases, we're adding non-hotel accommodations, and those properties often have lower room counts than some of the larger hotels. And so there's potentially a diminishing return as you continue to add hotels. But I think you can expect Booking.com and Agoda as well to continue to add properties to their list. Growth rates are driven, not just by adding new properties, although that's important, but also by driving greater penetration of existing hotels. And I think given the size of the business, that's equally important to a hotel count. So when you look at the business and the trends in unit growth, I'd point to not just new hotel counts but also to penetration of existing hotels, and then just to driving fundamental underlying demand, which is also an important driver of momentum in unit growth."

So in terms of online advertising and its impact on deleverage, we've seen for several quarters a continuing trend where the mix of our business is shifting more to paid channels, and that's just the way people are choosing to access the Internet and find our website. So we are pleased to participate in that in an effective fashion and then it’s been a very important driver of demand for our websites. We saw this past quarters a deterioration in trends year-over-year in terms of advertising ROI so a fundamental efficiency for our brands. We don't get into a lot of the specifics behind that, but you know the drivers are ADRs and year-over-year cancel rates. We've talked from time-to-time and we give a specific guidance on ADRs, that those are down in Q3 year-over-year, and we're expecting them to be down further in Q4. So that's not helpful to unit economics. Cancel rates have been climbing for a while. It's -- one of the benefits of our model for Booking.com is that it's an agency model, and it's easy for a customer to cancel if their plans change. So we don't look at that as a net negative as long as our gross bookings growth rate net of cancels continues to climb at an attractive rate. And the other factors we've built into that in terms of CPC and conversion rates are more sensitive competitively, and so we don't speak to what we're seeing there, but those are the other factors that go into that equation. In terms of a stock repurchase, we have about $460 million authorized by our board that we can use to buy back stock. We did buyback in the first quarter of this year about $250 million, if I recall correctly; it's in our Q. And we continue to look from time-to-time, and we will buy back stock where we think there's an opportunity to do so at attractive prices."

And there's a very wide spectrum of approaches that companies in our space make to this issue. There are some outstanding companies who operate on very, very narrow margins and throw everything back into the business. That hasn't been our approach. And if you look at the other travel companies, online travel companies that we compete with, they generally are investing in their businesses at a much higher level than we are.

With respect to affiliate criteria, I'd say a couple of very broad things. The first is that we would tend to value more highly a branded affiliate that has its own product offering and something that customers are coming to the website for reasons that are independent and they have their own loyal customers. That's something that we would tend to value more highly than, for example, a website that doesn't have a substantial brand and relies primarily on Pay-Per-Click marketing where they'd be competing with us in the same channel, or search engine optimization kind of business. So those would be 2 contrasting types of affiliates, one which we would assign a little bit of a higher value to and one which we would assign a much lower value to. The second thing I would say is that our approach on that is also driven by our view of what the appropriate economics are for affiliate-type business. Our competition for certain affiliates might be much more aggressive pricing the business to affiliates where we might think we've got a pretty good chance of getting bookings directly to our sites, where we have big market share and not necessarily have to take inventory, which is in potentially short supply in high season and provide that to an affiliate for them to sell it and confer most of the economics to them. So those are 2 sorts of differences that you might find between us and our competition."
