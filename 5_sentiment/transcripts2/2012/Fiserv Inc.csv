Let me say upfront 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and",903,"Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon. Let me say upfront 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and took important steps to benefit our growth, earnings and capital structure for years to come. We are very well-positioned entering 2012. Our results in the quarter were strong.
Adjusted revenue grew 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% was the highest quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth continued to climb, increasing 3% in 2011 versus 1% last year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 20% in the quarter to $1.27 and increased 13% to a record $4.58 for the year, $0.04 above the high end of our original EPS range. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year's strong Q4 performance and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was down slightly to 29.2%.
Free cash flow of $734 million was essentially flat due primarily to increased capital expenditures and timing of working capital which we generally expect to reverse. Free cash flow per share increased 5% to $5.09 for the full year.
Free cash flow and free cash flow per share over the last 4 years have grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of 14% and 19%, respectively, reflecting the strength of our business model and consistent execution of our strategies. We allocated over $1 billion in capital in 2011, split about evenly between strategic acquisition and share repurchase.
We also refinanced a large block of our debt at historically low rates while extending our average duration by nearly 50%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain within our targeted debt-to-EBITDA range.
For 2011, we are focused on 3 key priorities: first, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.
Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated in both segments in 2011. The majority of our growth continues to be from high-quality recurring revenue in our existing businesses. Innovative new solutions such as mobile, P2P and Acumen are important element of our plan to further accelerate growth and are just beginning to ramp. Adjusted EPS growth 13% marked our 26th consecutive year of double-digit growth. Earnings grew while investing in these new solutions that should have the dual benefit of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margin.
Fostering a step change in our revenue growth is a rationale for centering the Fiserv culture on growth. The record success of our single sales organization is a proof point of that focus. We have significantly increased our expectations for sales performance in each of the last 2 years, and that's leading to better results.
In 2011, we attained 116% of quota which translates to an absolute increase in sales of 20% over 2010. For those keeping score, you may recall that our absolute sales in the second quarter were the highest in the company's history. Just 6 months later, the fourth quarter sales results set a new high watermark topping the Q2 performance.
We are also seeing increased productivity from our account managers across the company which adds to our ability to more closely match our solutions to the needs of our client base.
Differentiating solutions through innovation that leads to better client results is our highest priority. Financial institutions are rightfully focused on driving revenue and increasing efficiency to restore earnings lost over the last several years. The recent announcement that interest rates are expected to stay extremely low through late 2014 exacerbates that emphasis with technology playing a key role in solving the revenue and efficiency equation.
During the year, we acquired solutions that strengthened our leadership in channels and payments. First, we acquired M-Com, a global leader in mobile banking and payments, to solidify our position in a rapidly growing market. This allows us to control the development of mobile capabilities and complement our leadership positions in Online Banking, Account Processing and Payments.
We also acquired Maverick solutions to provide financial institutions with a suite of prepaid capabilities to capture new streams of revenue.
And importantly, we acquired CashEdge, the market leader in account-to-account transfer, online account opening and funding, P2P and data aggregation.
Each of these solutions can drive differentiation and revenue for our clients. As we enter 2012, we remain bullish on the opportunity to digitize approximately $11 billion U.S. P2P transactions, totaling $865 billion that are originated each year. Nearly 1,400 financial institutions have signed on to the Fiserv P2P network, which we expect to grow dramatically over the next several years.
We are also beginning to see financial institutions support mass marketing for P2P. For example, NFL pence may have noticed that Citibank ran a 15-second TV spot promoting not P2P, but Popmoney, during a playoff game on January 15 and it's run several times since. We also know that Allied Financial has been advertising Popmoney nationally in the radio. This advertising support customers and reinforces the belief that P2P enhances their consumer value proposition.
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom to provide more details on our financial results."

As Jeff said up front, adjusted revenue growth was 6% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, the highest since the first quarter of 2008. Strong license sales in our Financial segment drove top and bottom line performance in the quarter as the year-end volume behavior we saw the last 2 years repeated again in 2011.
Revenue growth accelerated once again in 2011 with full-year adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% compared with 1% last year. Adjusted internal revenue growth improved in both segments. Payments growth was up 1 percentage point to 4% and the Financial segment was up sharply to 3% compared to flat in 2010.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% in the quarter to $1.27 on strong operating performance and grew 13% in the full year to $4.58 which exceeded our original guidance range.
Strong revenue growth in the quarter, much of it from higher-margin solutions, drove adjusted operating income up 7% to a record $325 million for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points which includes an approximate 130-basis point negative impact from a discretionary profit-sharing accrual and higher commissions related to the record sales performance in the quarter, much of which supports future revenue.
For the full year, adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year as the operating leverage from revenue growth and the success of our operational effectiveness initiatives were offset by investments in new solutions such as Acumen, P2P and Mobiliti, higher expenses in the Corporate segment and the incremental employee compensation expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. Now onto the segment results.
Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 5% to $558 million in the quarter and increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Both year-over-year and sequential growth comparisons were negatively impacted by the completion of the Wachovia Bill payment deconversion, less bill payment processing days in the quarter and a reduction in non-financial institution revenue resulting from the Durbin Amendment.
Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 4% for the full year as compared to 3% in the prior year. Full income remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 4% in the quarter and 6% in the year excluding the impact of the Wachovia deconversion. The bulk of this deconversion will anniversary in the middle of 2012.
Our debit business continued to perform well in the first quarter of the new debit interchange fee structure under Durbin. Debit transaction volume increased 18% in the quarter and 19% in the year, driven by the continued expansion of our client base and the above-market transaction growth experienced by our clients, the great majority of which have assets below the $10 billion threshold of the Durbin legislation.
Operating income in the Payments segment increased 4% in the quarter to $174 million and grew 5% to $656 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 31.2% and decreased 20 basis points for the full year to 31%. The continuing investments in Mobiliti, P2P and Internet banking, along with the incremental employee costs in the quarter, pressured margins. In addition, the CashEdge results had a dilutive impact on segment margin in the quarter and for the full year.
Financial segment adjusted revenue was $540 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the full year, reflecting adjusted internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. As we anticipated, we saw significant increase in higher margin revenue, such as license fees in the quarter. That result, combined with our steady core Account Processing growth, contributed to the highest quarterly growth rate in our Financial segment in the last 4 years.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up a very strong 11% in the quarter to $178 million. Operating margin expanded by 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.1%, due largely to the expected increase in higher margin revenue.
For the full year, operating income grew 4% to $613 million compared with $591 million in 2010 and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 30.6%.
Operating margin for the full year was positively impacted by continued leverage in our core Account Processing businesses, incremental savings from our operational effectiveness initiatives, increased efficiencies in our Item Processing business, partially offset by solution investments such as Acumen, Relationship Advance and our common loan origination platform.
Our adjusted effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter was in line with expectations and the 36% full-year rate is a healthy improvement over 2010. Forward 2012, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in line with 2011 at approximately 36%.
In addition to the continuing implementation of focused strategies that have the cumulative effect of lowering our tax rate for the last couple of years, our rate estimate assumes also the renewal of the R&D credit in 2012.
Free cash flow increased a strong 12% to $227 million in the quarter. Full-year free cash flow was essentially flat at $734 million and was impacted by a $17 million increase in capital expenditures which includes our data center transformation project and changes in working capital.
We had a $60 million increase in accounts receivable versus the comparable prior-year quarter, resulting from our strong revenue finish to the year. We anticipate the year-end spike in accounts receivable in 2011 will convert to cash in 2012, resulting in higher than typical free cash flow guidance which Jeff will cover later.
Free cash flow per share grew 5% to $5.9 for the year as a result of our disciplined capital allocation.
We paid off the $120 million in the quarter that have been added to our revolver associated with the acquisition of CashEdge and have a 0 balance on our $1 billion credit facility at year-end. We will also refinance our $1.1 billion term loan which matures in November during 2012.
At this time, we do not anticipate significant interest savings from a refinance given the current rate structure and our bias towards longer term debt maturities as part of our capital structure. We repurchased 8.8 million shares of stock in 2011 for $533 million which included 1 million shares in the fourth quarter for $58 million. This compares favorably to the 8.1 million shares repurchased in 2010 even as we completed several strategic acquisitions during the year. As of December 31, there are 4.7 million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."

Full-year sales landed at 116% of quota, an absolute increase of 20%. Sales strength continued in areas aligned with our strategies including significant rents in channels, payments and Account Processing. Examples of our many digital channel wins for the year include Navy Federal Credit Union for Corillian Online Banking, Regions Bank for Corillian business banking and U.S. Bank for Mobiliti. We ended the year signing nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients and are positioned to exceed that number for sales in 2012. We added 435 new Bill payment clients, including the return of Zions Bank. We also gained nearly 200 debit clients during the year and had increased the number of clients within the ACCEL/Exchange debit network. Overall in 2011, we recorded more than 1,200 wins in Bill payment, debit and P2P.
We're pleased to announce that we inked a multiyear extension of our long-standing reseller relationship with Intuit. In addition to traditional Bill payment services, we're working to enhance those client relationships through a set of payment solutions that should provide value over the next several years. In Account Processing, we continued to win over 50% of all of the competitive deals in the market. Momentum continued to build with 5 Acumen sales deal signed in the quarter and a total of 8 U.S. wins for the year.
As we continue to win larger multiproduct deals, as well as ramp up our newer solutions, we continue to expect that revenue will be recognized over 12 to 24-month period and that recurring revenue builds over time. Given our experience with sales over the last several years and the complexity of the opportunities we are pursuing, we expect sales cycles to remain long and that will have the effect of skewing revenue to the latter part of each year.
Integrated sales were a very strong $71 million in the quarter. Once again, channels and payments were the most popular solutions leading the way to $184 million of integrated sales for the full year or 119% of our 2011 target. Our operational effectiveness results were excellent with $18 million of benefit in the quarter and $45 million for the year, exceeding our 2011 target by 80%.
Our view of market conditions remains generally consistent with that of our third quarter call and Investor Day. 2011 ended with 110 regulatory actions, impacting 92 banks and 18 credit unions, a reduction of about 40% from 2010. As important as the number, institutions impacted by regulatory actions in 2011 were much smaller than in previous years. Over the last 4 years, and contrary to some exaggerated estimates at the peak of the financial crisis, less than 500 financial institutions have been subject to a regulatory action in the United States.
During that period, we lost less than 25 Account Processing clients due to actions which is likely less than if we had been in a more typical M&A environment. In 2012, we expect the number of regulatory actions to continue to decline probably to less than 90 this year. To date, there have been 9 regulatory actions versus 11 last year.
De novo activity continued to be very low with only 3 new charters issued through September 30 and we believe that level of activity will continue in 2012. We anticipate voluntary M&A to be about consistent with its current level. We expect IT budgets to be prioritized to areas that drive revenue, allow ease of movement within and across channels and deepen customer relationships. We believe growth in technology spend will approximately -- approximate the 2011 levels, with a bias towards spending in the second half of the year.
Overall, we believe the end market is solidifying. The questions of institutional survival are increasingly rare and the discussions are now centered on moving forward in a new world of competitive banking. Our key priorities for 2012 remains substantially the same with an added emphasis on aligning our focus against the secular momentum we see in the market.
Guidance for 2012 is based on an assumption that technology spending and the overall environment will be substantially similar to 2011. As I mentioned, we believe there has been a secular change in purchasing behaviors which bias these non-time-sensitive technology decisions to later in the year. The change in historic buying patterns continue to have the effect of pushing more of our sales and revenue growth towards year-end.
For 2012, where expect total adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%. Revenue growth for the year includes a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points from a reduction in revenue due to the Durbin Amendment not sourced through financial institutions.
Overall, we expect our revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. We expect 2012 adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 14% or a range of $5.04 to $5.20 compared to the $4.58 earned in 2011.
Each year, our revenue and EPS guidance incorporates the impact of contract renewals that we expect during the year. Our 2012 guidance for adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS includes an estimate for the range of likely outcomes related to the possibility of an early renewal of our Bank of America Bill Pay contract. We anticipate that overall adjusted operating margin will increase 50 basis points or more in 2012. We also estimate the free cash flow for 2012 will increase 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be in excess of $5.70 for the full year.
Our 2012 integrated sales target is $200 million and our operational effectiveness objective is $40 million which will exclude any nonrecurring costs related to the multiyear cost-saving effort.
As I said up front, we had a very strong year. Revenue growth is stepping up, sales results are reinforcing the value of our solutions and we are benefiting from secular momentum in areas of new investment. The experience, talent and commitment of our associates gives us confidence that we will deliver value for years to come.
With that, Carol, let's open the lines for questions."

So whether it is with P2P or Relationship Advance, a series of different products like that, we're having some good success. By the same token, kind of the movement around branches, those kinds of things, you're seeing a lot of energy on the electronic channel side. So Online Banking, we announced a win in the quarter with Navy Federal Credit Union. They've decided that they're going to transform their Internet banking presence, U.S. Bank last year, WestPac the year before that. And so those are just some of the larger institutions. But we're really seeing that energy across as institutions are trying to move both transactions and service to lower-cost channels and mobile is also a derivative of that as well. So lots of energy on that side. And then there's a need for the institutions to start to wire those -- the information and insights that are coming out of those channels together to create a better picture of the experience. So from our standpoint, given that we put so much focus in those areas, we see that being fairly valuable. And then last, I would say that overall, as we see institutions looking to just kind of step down their cost structure, given some of the spread pressures that now appear to extend out through '14, you see vendor consolidation and just general more bundling, which to some extent, gets to some of the larger sales that we've had, but also gets a little bit to the longer implementation cycles."

We should be clear, right, that we also wanted to try to avoid some negativity that was directed a couple of years ago, 3 years ago now, when we renewed the Bank of America agreement after we had given guidance. So at this stage, given the expiration in '13, we thought it would be best Incorporated into our guidance for the year. But let me -- I probably should add one more point. We do not -- we're not sitting here today knowing that there is a number, right? It's just a range of different possibilities that we have discussed and in terms of formulating our guidance."

We have invested a lot in scaling up our ASP infrastructure. And clearly, that recurring revenue is not really even started to calm on yet. And so we have a lot of that infrastructure built that's in the segment along with a lot of investment in P2P and then really in the online channel. We mentioned again another transaction with Navy Federal. We've had a really big ramp-up in our development operation in Online Banking and also in the ASP channel and just a lot of activity there. So we've had a good amount of investment which just kind of kept those margins fairly flat. But if you look at our debit card business, if you look at the Bill payment business, you look at P2P, which is really not started yet, those businesses have great economic characteristics and those will continue to scale incrementally after margins."

It brings in -- for example, it brings in a whole other consumer, potentially a new consumer and a new consumer who likes to transact. We're not fighting at point of sale.

One of the things that we've -- I guess, I'll say one of the phenomena that we've seen over the last couple of years is in connection with some of the challenges that FIs have had, when they're looking to make these investments, they're often looking to reduce costs, their own cost structure to fund some of the investments. So take Internet banking, for example. One of the client that we announced that we signed this quarter is a very significant transformation of their technology. But we're also going to be hosting that for them. So there are all kinds of intricacies around revenue recognition where you're building and hosting. And from our standpoint, we make those decisions not based on Rembrandt, we make those decisions on what creates most value. And so we'd rather have a larger deal even if it creates an issue around us deferring revenue for some period of time. And we do that as -- anytime we have that opportunity, we do that. To Tom's point, you'll have those kinds of the law Middle East but from a cost perspective, beyond the commissions that Tom referenced, we've had steadily increasing commissions because we've got steadily increasing strong sales performance. I would say that's the only issue. And that's -- any surprise in the fourth quarter, that was probably one of them. Our sales were so strong and that revenue is largely not in the quarter. That created a bit of a mismatch on the commission versus revenue benefit."

We think that the environment has become more stable just because more of the rules -- the more the rules are known and people or institutions, especially larger ones, are taking action to make sure that they can do what they need to do around growing revenue but really around growing earnings. So on one hand, we are seeing peoples spend. On the other hand, we're seeing some of the other financial institutions take people-oriented actions and take steps to reduce their cost structure. The benefit that we have and the reason why we probably have more optimism than some is we're quite confident that the areas in which we have been investing in over the last several years, as well as existing solutions like Bill Payment. They're just not viewed as discretionary. I haven't met a single banker, right, someone who runs a large institution, whether it's a credit union or a bank, who is willing to do for a mobile position. People are just not willing to do that and they're really looking for ways to drive revenue. And that, right now, is a good fit for us given where we have chosen to invest over the last several years. Don't get me wrong. I still think there's a lot of -- there's going to be a lot of profitability pressure in financial institutions. I still think we're going to be subject to price compression as we have been. And I don't think there's anywhere near a wallet that's being opened up very wide. So from that standpoint, that's why we are taking what I would say a more pragmatic view, we think spend will be about -- I'm sorry, I should clarify, the rate of technology spend growth will be about the same year-over-year. But we'll see -- we think it will buy us more areas that are well-suited right now."

Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and",909,"Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon. Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and took important steps to benefit our growth, earnings and capital structure for years to come. We are very well-positioned entering 2012. Our results in the quarter were strong.
Adjusted revenue grew 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% was the highest quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth continued to climb, increasing 3% in 2011 versus 1% last year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 20% in the quarter to $1.27 and increased 13% to a record $4.58 for the year, $0.04 above the high end of our original EPS range. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year's strong Q4 performance and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was down slightly to 29.2%.
Free cash flow of $734 million was essentially flat due primarily to increased capital expenditures and timing of working capital which we generally expect to reverse. Free cash flow per share increased 5% to $5.09 for the full year.
Free cash flow and free cash flow per share over the last 4 years have grown at a cumulative annual growth rates of 14% and 19%, respectively, reflecting the strength of our business model and consistent execution of our strategies. We allocated over $1 billion in capital in 2011, split about evenly between strategic acquisition and share repurchase.
We also refinanced a large block of our debt at historically low rates while extending our average duration by nearly 50%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain within our targeted debt-to-EBITDA range.
For 2011, we were focused on 3 key priorities: first, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.
Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated in both segments in 2011. The majority of our growth continues to be from high-quality recurring revenue in our existing businesses. Innovative new solutions such as Mobile, P2P and Acumen are important element of our plan to further accelerate growth and are just beginning to ramp. Adjusted EPS growth of 13% marked our 26th consecutive year of double-digit growth. Earnings grew while investing in these new solutions that should have the dual benefit of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margin.
Fostering a step change in our revenue growth is a rationale for centering the Fiserv culture on growth. The record success of our single sales organization is a proof point to that focus. We have significantly increased our expectations for sales performance in each of the last 2 years, and that's leading to better results.
In 2011, we attained 116% of quota which translates to an absolute increase in sales of 20% over 2010. For those keeping score, you may recall that our absolute sales in the second quarter were the highest in the company's history. Just 6 months later, the fourth quarter sales results set a new high watermark topping the Q2 performance.
We are also seeing increased productivity from our account managers across the company which adds to our ability to more closely match our solutions to the needs of our client base.
Differentiating solutions through innovation that leads to better client results is our highest priority. Financial institutions are rightfully focused on driving revenue and increasing efficiency to restore earnings lost over the last several years. The recent Fed announcement that interest rates are expected to stay extremely low through late 2014 exacerbates that emphasis, with technology playing a key role in solving the revenue and efficiency equation.
During the year, we acquired solutions that strengthened our leadership in channels and payments. First, we acquired M-Com, a global leader in mobile banking and payments, to solidify our position in a rapidly growing market. This allows us to control the development of mobile capabilities and complement our leadership positions in Online Banking, Account Processing and Payments.
We also acquired Maverick solutions to provide financial institutions with a suite of prepaid capabilities to capture new streams of revenue.
And importantly, we acquired CashEdge, the market leader in account-to-account transfer, online account opening and funding, P2P and data aggregation.
Each of these solutions can drive differentiation and revenue for our clients. As we enter 2012, we remain bullish on the opportunity to digitize approximately $11 billion U.S. P2P transactions, totaling $865 billion that are originated each year. Nearly 1,400 financial institutions have signed on to the Fiserv P2P network, which we expect to grow dramatically over the next several years.
We are also beginning to see financial institutions support mass marketing for P2P. For example, NFL fans may have noticed that Citibank ran a 15-second TV spot promoting not P2P, but Popmoney, during a playoff game on January 15 and it's run several times since. We also know that Allied Financial has been advertising Popmoney nationally on the radio. This marketing support has come via our customers and reinforces the belief that P2P enhances their consumer value proposition.
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom to provide more details on our financial results."

As Jeff said up front, adjusted revenue growth was 6% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, the highest since the first quarter of 2008. Strong license sales in our Financial segment drove top and bottom line performance in the quarter as the year-end volume behavior we saw in the last 2 years repeated again in 2011.
Revenue growth accelerated once again in 2011 with full-year adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% compared with 1% last year. Adjusted internal revenue growth improved in both segments. Payments growth was up 1 percentage point to 4% and the Financial segment was up sharply to 3% compared to flat in 2010.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% in the quarter to $1.27 on strong operating performance and grew 13% in the full year to $4.58 which exceeded our original guidance range.
Strong revenue growth in the quarter, much of it from higher-margin solutions, drove adjusted operating income up 7% to a record $325 million for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points which includes an approximate 130-basis-point negative impact from a discretionary profit-sharing accrual at higher commissions related to the record sales performance in the quarter, much of which supports future revenue.
For the full year, adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year as the operating leverage from revenue growth and the success of our operational effectiveness initiatives were offset by investments in new solutions such as Acumen, P2P and Mobiliti, higher expenses in the Corporate segment and the incremental employee compensation expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. Now on to the segment results.
Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 5% to $558 million in the quarter and increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Both year-over-year and sequential growth comparisons were negatively impacted by the completion of the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion, less bill payment processing days in the quarter and a reduction in non-financial institution revenue resulting from the Durbin Amendment.
Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 4% for the full year, as compared to 3% in the prior year. Full income remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 4% in the quarter and 6% in the year excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion. The bulk of this de-conversion will anniversary in the middle of 2012.
Our debit business continued to perform well in the first quarter of the new debit interchange fee structure under Durbin. Debit transaction volume increased 18% in the quarter and 19% in the year, driven by the continued expansion of our client base and the above-market transaction growth experienced by our clients, the great majority of which have assets below the $10 billion threshold of the Durbin legislation.
Operating income in the Payments segment increased 4% in the quarter to $174 million and grew 5% to $656 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 31.2% and decreased 20 basis points for the full year to 31%. The continuing investments in Mobiliti, P2P and Internet banking, along with the incremental employee costs in the quarter, pressured margins. In addition, the CashEdge results had a dilutive impact on segment margin in the quarter and for the full year.
Financial segment adjusted revenue was $540 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the full year, reflecting adjusted internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. As we anticipated, we saw a significant increase in higher margin revenue, such as license fees in the quarter. That result, combined with our steady core Account Processing growth, contributed to the highest quarterly growth rate in our Financial segment in the last 4 years.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up a very strong 11% in the quarter to $178 million. Operating margin expanded by 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.1%, due largely to the expected increase in higher margin revenue.
For the full year, operating income grew 4% to $613 million compared with $591 million in 2010 and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 30.6%.
Operating margin for the full year was positively impacted by a continued leverage in our core Account Processing businesses, incremental savings from our operational effectiveness initiatives, increased efficiencies in our Item Processing business, partially offset by solution investments such as Acumen, Relationship Advance and our common loan origination platform.
Our adjusted effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter was in line with expectations and the 36% full-year rate is a healthy improvement over 2010. Forward 2012, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in line with 2011 at approximately 36%.
In addition to the continuing implementation of focused strategies that have had the cumulative effect of lowering our tax rate for the last couple of years, our rate estimate assumes also the renewal of the R&D credit in 2012.
Free cash flow increased a strong 12% to $227 million in the quarter. Full-year free cash flow was essentially flat at $734 million and was impacted by a $17 million increase in capital expenditures which includes our data center transformation project and changes in working capital.
We had a $60 million increase in accounts receivable versus a comparable prior-year quarter, resulting from our strong revenue finish to the year. We anticipate the year-end spike in accounts receivable in 2011 will convert to cash in 2012, resulting in higher-than-typical free cash flow guidance which Jeff will cover later.
Free cash flow per share grew 5% to $5.09 for the year as a result of our disciplined capital allocation.
We paid off the $120 million in the quarter that have been added to our revolver associated with the acquisition of CashEdge and have a 0 balance on our $1 billion credit facility at year-end. We will also refinance our $1.1 billion term loan which matures in November during 2012.
At this time, we do not anticipate significant interest savings from a refinance given the current rate structure and our bias towards longer term debt maturities as part of our capital structure. We repurchased 8.8 million shares of stock in 2011 for $533 million which included 1 million shares in the fourth quarter for $58 million. This compares favorably to the 8.1 million shares repurchased in 2010 even as we completed several strategic acquisitions during the year. As of December 31, there are 4.7 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,145499713,215182,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2012",2012-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

Full-year sales landed at 116% of quota, an absolute increase of 20%. Sales strength continued in areas aligned with our strategies including significant wins in channels, payments and Account Processing. Examples of our many digital channel wins for the year include Navy Federal Credit Union for Corillian online banking, Regions Bank for Corillian business banking and U.S. Bank for Mobiliti. 
We ended the year signing nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients and are positioned to exceed that number for sales in 2012. We added 435 new bill payment clients, including the return of Zions Bank. We also gained nearly 200 debit clients during the year and had increased the number of clients within the ACCEL/Exchange debit network. Overall in 2011, we recorded more than 1,200 wins in bill payment, debit and P2P.
We're pleased to announce that we inked a multiyear extension of our long-standing reseller relationship with Intuit. In addition to traditional Bill payment services, we're working to enhance those client relationships through a set of payment solutions that should provide value over the next several years. In Account Processing, we continued to win over 50% of all of the competitive deals in the market. Momentum continued to build with 5 Acumen sales deal signed in the quarter and a total of 8 U.S. wins for the year.
As we continue to win larger multiproduct deals, as well as ramp up our newer solutions, we continue to expect that revenue will be recognized over 12 to 24-month period and that recurring revenue builds over time. Given our experience with sales over the last several years and the complexity of the opportunities we are pursuing, we expect sales cycles to remain long and that will have the effect of skewing revenue to the latter part of each year.
Integrated sales were a very strong $71 million in the quarter. Once again, channels and payments were the most popular solutions leading the way to $184 million of integrated sales for the full year or 119% of our 2011 target. Our operational effectiveness results were excellent with $18 million of benefit in the quarter and $45 million for the year, exceeding our 2011 target by 80%.
Our view of market conditions remains generally consistent with that of our third quarter call and Investor Day. 2011 ended with 110 regulatory actions, impacting 92 banks and 18 credit unions, a reduction of about 40% from 2010. As important as the number, institutions impacted by regulatory actions in 2011 were much smaller than in previous years. Over the last 4 years, and contrary to some exaggerated estimates at the peak of the financial crisis, less than 500 financial institutions have been subject to a regulatory action in the United States.
During that period, we lost less than 25 Account Processing clients due to actions which is likely less than if we had been in a more typical M&A environment. In 2012, we expect the number of regulatory actions to continue to decline probably to less than 90 this year. To date, there have been 9 regulatory actions versus 11 last year.
De novo activity continued to be very low with only 3 new charters issued through September 30 and we believe that level of activity will continue in 2012. We anticipate voluntary M&A to be about consistent with its current level. We expect IT budgets to be prioritized to areas that drive revenue, allow ease of movement within and across channels and deepen customer relationships. We believe growth in technology spend will approximately -- approximate the 2011 levels, with a bias towards spending in the second half of the year.
Overall, we believe the end market is solidifying. The questions of institutional survival are increasingly rare and the discussions are now centered on moving forward in a new world of competitive banking. Our key priorities for 2012 remain substantially the same with an added emphasis on aligning our focus against the secular momentum we see in the market.
Guidance for 2012 is based on an assumption that technology spending and the overall environment will be substantially similar to 2011. As I mentioned, we believe there has been a secular change in purchasing behaviors which bias these non-time-sensitive technology decisions to later in the year. This change in historic buying patterns continue to have the effect of pushing more of our sales and revenue growth towards year-end.
For 2012, where expect total adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%. Revenue growth for the year includes a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points from a reduction in revenue due to the Durbin Amendment not sourced through financial institutions.
Overall, we expect our revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. We expect 2012 adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 14% or a range of $5.04 to $5.20 compared to the $4.58 earned in 2011.
Each year, our revenue and EPS guidance incorporates the impact of contract renewals that we expect during the year. Our 2012 guidance for adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS includes an estimate for the range of likely outcomes related to the possibility of an early renewal of our Bank of America bill pay contract. We anticipate that overall adjusted operating margin will increase 50 basis points or more in 2012. We also estimate the free cash flow for 2012 will increase 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be in excess of $5.70 for the full year.
Our 2012 integrated sales target is $200 million and our operational effectiveness objective is $40 million, which will exclude any nonrecurring costs related to the multiyear cost-saving effort.
As I said up front, we had a very strong year. Revenue growth is stepping up, sales results are reinforcing the value of our solutions and we are benefiting from secular momentum in areas of new investment. The experience, talent and commitment of our associates gives us confidence that we will deliver value for years to come.
With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

So whether it is with P2P or Relationship Advance, a series of different products like that, we're having some good success. By the same token, kind of the movement around branches, those kinds of things, you're seeing a lot of energy on the electronic channel side. So Online Banking, we announced a win in the quarter with Navy Federal Credit Union. They've decided that they're going to transform their Internet banking presence, U.S. Bank last year, WestPac the year before that. And so those are just some of the larger institutions. But we're really seeing that energy across as institutions are trying to move both transactions and service to lower-cost channels and mobile is also a derivative of that as well. So lots of energy on that side. And then there's a need for the institutions to start to wire those -- the information and insights that are coming out of those channels together to create a better picture of the experience. So from our standpoint, given that we put so much focus in those areas, we see that being fairly valuable. And then last, I would say that overall, as we see institutions looking to just kind of step down their cost structure, given some of the spread pressures that now appear to extend out through '14, you see vendor consolidation and just general more bundling which, to some extent, gets to some of the larger sales that we've had, but also gets a little bit to the longer implementation cycles."

It's not unusual that a contract of -- actually any of the larger contracts end up getting renewed early. And sometimes in renewals there are discounts, sometimes there not. But what we did is we spent a lot of time to make sure that we had incorporated that range of outcomes so that's what's in our guidance. So I think mathematically, to the extent that there was a discount given, right? And that certainly is within the range of possibility if there was a discount. If it happened in January, it would likely be larger just mathematically that it would be in December. So from that, I think the math that you're thinking about is likely the right math. We should be clear, right, that we also wanted to try to avoid some negativity that was directed a couple of years ago, or 3 years ago now, when we renewed the Bank of America agreement after we had given guidance. So at this stage, given the expiration in '13, we thought it would be best to incorporated it into our guidance for the year. But let me -- I probably should add one more point.

One of the things that we've -- I guess, I'll say one of the phenomena that we've seen over the last couple of years is in connection with some of the challenges that FIs have had, when they're looking to make these investments, they're often looking to reduce cost, their own cost structure to fund some of the investments. So take Internet banking, for example. One of the clients that we announced that we signed this quarter is a very significant transformation of their technology. But we're also going to be hosting that for them. So there are all kinds of intricacies around revenue recognition where you're building and hosting. And from our standpoint, we make those decisions not based on rev ramp [ph]. We make those decisions on what creates most value. And so we'd rather have a larger deal even if it creates an issue around us deferring revenue for some period of time. And we do that as -- anytime we have that opportunity, we do that. So to Tom's point, you'll have those kinds of anomalies. But from a cost perspective, beyond the commissions that Tom referenced, and we've had steadily increasing commissions because we've had steadily increasing strong sales performance. I would say that's the only issue. And that's -- to the extent there was any surprise in the fourth quarter, that was probably one of them. Our sales were so strong and that revenue is largely not in the quarter, that created a bit of a mismatch on the commission versus revenue benefit."

We think that the environment has become more stable just because more of the rules -- the more the rules are known and people or institutions, especially larger ones, are taking action to make sure that they can do what they need to do around growing revenue. But really around growing earnings. So on one hand, we are seeing people spend. On the other hand, we're also seeing some of the larger financial institutions take people-oriented actions and take steps to reduce their cost structure. The benefit that we have and the reason why we probably have more optimism than some is we're quite confident that the areas in which we have been investing in over the last several years, as well as existing solutions like bill payment, they're just not viewed as discretionary. Now I haven't met a single call it banker, right, someone who runs a large institution, whether it's a credit union or a bank, who is willing to defer a mobile decision. People just are not willing to do that and they're really looking for ways to drive revenue. And that, right now, is a good fit for us given where we have chosen to invest over the last several years. Don't get me wrong. I still think there's a lot of -- there's going to be a lot of profitability pressure in financial institutions. I still think we're going to be subject to price compression as we have been. And I don't think there's anywhere near a wallet that's being opened up very wide. So from that standpoint, that's why we are taking what I would say a more pragmatic view. We think spend will be about -- I'm sorry, I should clarify, the rate of technology spend growth will be about the same year-over-year. But we'll see -- we think it will buy us more areas in which we're well-suited right now."

There's a level of these incremental license sales that's just natural and we've seen over the last year's is it's just moved to later in the year which creates the spike. So when you say, ""How much of the 6% can I count on?"" You may not be able to count on it in a quarter. But we are very confident that we've been stepping up our growth rate.

Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and",909,"Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon. Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and took important steps to benefit our growth, earnings and capital structure for years to come. We are very well-positioned entering 2012. Our results in the quarter were strong.
Adjusted revenue grew 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% was the highest quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth continued to climb, increasing 3% in 2011 versus 1% last year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 20% in the quarter to $1.27 and increased 13% to a record $4.58 for the year, $0.04 above the high end of our original EPS range. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year's strong Q4 performance and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was down slightly to 29.2%.
Free cash flow of $734 million was essentially flat due primarily to increased capital expenditures and timing of working capital which we generally expect to reverse. Free cash flow per share increased 5% to $5.09 for the full year.
Free cash flow and free cash flow per share over the last 4 years have grown at a cumulative annual growth rates of 14% and 19%, respectively, reflecting the strength of our business model and consistent execution of our strategies. We allocated over $1 billion in capital in 2011, split about evenly between strategic acquisition and share repurchase.
We also refinanced a large block of our debt at historically low rates while extending our average duration by nearly 50%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain within our targeted debt-to-EBITDA range.
For 2011, we were focused on 3 key priorities: first, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.
Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated in both segments in 2011. The majority of our growth continues to be from high-quality recurring revenue in our existing businesses. Innovative new solutions such as Mobile, P2P and Acumen are important element of our plan to further accelerate growth and are just beginning to ramp. Adjusted EPS growth of 13% marked our 26th consecutive year of double-digit growth. Earnings grew while investing in these new solutions that should have the dual benefit of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margin.
Fostering a step change in our revenue growth is a rationale for centering the Fiserv culture on growth. The record success of our single sales organization is a proof point to that focus. We have significantly increased our expectations for sales performance in each of the last 2 years, and that's leading to better results.
In 2011, we attained 116% of quota which translates to an absolute increase in sales of 20% over 2010. For those keeping score, you may recall that our absolute sales in the second quarter were the highest in the company's history. Just 6 months later, the fourth quarter sales results set a new high watermark topping the Q2 performance.
We are also seeing increased productivity from our account managers across the company which adds to our ability to more closely match our solutions to the needs of our client base.
Differentiating solutions through innovation that leads to better client results is our highest priority. Financial institutions are rightfully focused on driving revenue and increasing efficiency to restore earnings lost over the last several years. The recent Fed announcement that interest rates are expected to stay extremely low through late 2014 exacerbates that emphasis, with technology playing a key role in solving the revenue and efficiency equation.
During the year, we acquired solutions that strengthened our leadership in channels and payments. First, we acquired M-Com, a global leader in mobile banking and payments, to solidify our position in a rapidly growing market. This allows us to control the development of mobile capabilities and complement our leadership positions in Online Banking, Account Processing and Payments.
We also acquired Maverick solutions to provide financial institutions with a suite of prepaid capabilities to capture new streams of revenue.
And importantly, we acquired CashEdge, the market leader in account-to-account transfer, online account opening and funding, P2P and data aggregation.
Each of these solutions can drive differentiation and revenue for our clients. As we enter 2012, we remain bullish on the opportunity to digitize approximately 11 billion U.S. P2P transactions, totaling $865 billion that are originated each year. Nearly 1,400 financial institutions have signed on to the Fiserv P2P network, which we expect to grow dramatically over the next several years.
We are also beginning to see financial institutions support mass marketing for P2P. For example, NFL fans may have noticed that Citibank ran a 15-second TV spot promoting not P2P, but Popmoney, during a playoff game on January 15 and it's run several times since. We also know that Allied Financial has been advertising Popmoney nationally on the radio. This marketing support has come via our customers and reinforces the belief that P2P enhances their consumer value proposition.
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom to provide more details on our financial results."

As Jeff said up front, adjusted revenue growth was 6% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, the highest since the first quarter of 2008. Strong license sales in our Financial segment drove top and bottom line performance in the quarter as the year-end volume behavior we saw in the last 2 years repeated again in 2011.
Revenue growth accelerated once again in 2011 with full-year adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% compared with 1% last year. Adjusted internal revenue growth improved in both segments. Payments growth was up 1 percentage point to 4% and the Financial segment was up sharply to 3% compared to flat in 2010.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% in the quarter to $1.27 on strong operating performance and grew 13% in the full year to $4.58 which exceeded our original guidance range.
Strong revenue growth in the quarter, much of it from higher-margin solutions, drove adjusted operating income up 7% to a record $325 million for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points which includes an approximate 130-basis-point negative impact from a discretionary profit-sharing accrual and higher commissions related to the record sales performance in the quarter, much of which supports future revenue.
For the full year, adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year as the operating leverage from revenue growth and the success of our operational effectiveness initiatives were offset by investments in new solutions such as Acumen, P2P and Mobiliti, higher expenses in the Corporate segment and the incremental employee compensation expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. Now on to the segment results.
Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 5% to $558 million in the quarter and increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Both year-over-year and sequential growth comparisons were negatively impacted by the completion of the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion, less bill payment processing days in the quarter and a reduction in non-financial institution revenue resulting from the Durbin Amendment.
Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 4% for the full year, as compared to 3% in the prior year. Full income remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 4% in the quarter and 6% in the year excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion. The bulk of this de-conversion will anniversary in the middle of 2012.
Our debit business continued to perform well in the first quarter of the new debit interchange fee structure under Durbin. Debit transaction volume increased 18% in the quarter and 19% in the year, driven by the continued expansion of our client base and the above-market transaction growth experienced by our clients, the great majority of which have assets below the $10 billion threshold of the Durbin legislation.
Operating income in the Payments segment increased 4% in the quarter to $174 million and grew 5% to $656 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 31.2% and decreased 20 basis points for the full year to 31%. The continuing investments in Mobiliti, P2P and Internet banking, along with the incremental employee costs in the quarter, pressured margins. In addition, the CashEdge results had a dilutive impact on segment margin in the quarter and for the full year.
Financial segment adjusted revenue was $540 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the full year, reflecting adjusted internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. As we anticipated, we saw a significant increase in higher margin revenue, such as license fees in the quarter. That result, combined with our steady core Account Processing growth, contributed to the highest quarterly growth rate in our Financial segment in the last 4 years.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up a very strong 11% in the quarter to $178 million. Operating margin expanded by 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.1%, due largely to the expected increase in higher margin revenue.
For the full year, operating income grew 4% to $613 million compared with $591 million in 2010 and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 30.6%.
Operating margin for the full year was positively impacted by continued leverage in our core Account Processing businesses, incremental savings from our operational effectiveness initiatives, increased efficiencies in our Item Processing business, partially offset by solution investments such as Acumen, Relationship Advance and our common loan origination platform.
Our adjusted effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter was in line with expectations and the 36% full-year rate is a healthy improvement over 2010. For 2012, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in line with 2011 at approximately 36%.
In addition to the continuing implementation of focused strategies that have had the cumulative effect of lowering our tax rate for the last couple of years, our rate estimate assumes also the renewal of the R&D credit in 2012.
Free cash flow increased a strong 12% to $227 million in the quarter. Full-year free cash flow was essentially flat at $734 million and was impacted by a $17 million increase in capital expenditures which includes our data center transformation project and changes in working capital.
We had a $60 million increase in accounts receivable versus the comparable prior-year quarter, resulting from our strong revenue finish to the year. We anticipate the year-end spike in accounts receivable in 2011 will convert to cash in 2012, resulting in higher-than-typical free cash flow guidance which Jeff will cover later.
Free cash flow per share grew 5% to $5.09 for the year as a result of our disciplined capital allocation.
We paid off the $120 million in the quarter that have been added to our revolver associated with the acquisition of CashEdge and have a 0 balance on our $1 billion credit facility at year-end. We will also refinance our $1.1 billion term loan which matures in November during 2012.
At this time, we do not anticipate significant interest savings from a refinance given the current rate structure and our bias towards longer term debt maturities as part of our capital structure. We repurchased 8.8 million shares of stock in 2011 for $533 million which included 1 million shares in the fourth quarter for $58 million. This compares favorably to the 8.1 million shares repurchased in 2010 even as we completed several strategic acquisitions during the year. As of December 31, there are 4.7 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,145499713,215247,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2012",2012-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Our record sales in the quarter were up 28% over last year's also strong fourth quarter. Full-year sales landed at 116% of quota, an absolute increase of 20%.

Full-year sales landed at 116% of quota, an absolute increase of 20%. Sales strength continued in areas aligned with our strategies including significant wins in channels, payments and Account Processing. Examples of our many digital channel wins for the year include Navy Federal Credit Union for Corillian online banking, Regions Bank for Corillian business banking and U.S. Bank for Mobiliti. 
We ended the year signing nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients and are positioned to exceed that number for sales in 2012. We added 435 new bill payment clients, including the return of Zions Bank. We also gained nearly 200 debit clients during the year and had increased the number of clients within the ACCEL/Exchange debit network. Overall in 2011, we recorded more than 1,200 wins in bill payment, debit and P2P.
We're pleased to announce that we inked a multiyear extension of our long-standing reseller relationship with Intuit. In addition to traditional Bill payment services, we're working to enhance those client relationships through a set of payment solutions that should provide value over the next several years. In Account Processing, we continued to win over 50% of all of the competitive deals in the market. Momentum continued to build with 5 Acumen sales deal signed in the quarter and a total of 8 U.S. wins for the year.
As we continue to win larger multiproduct deals, as well as ramp up our newer solutions, we continue to expect that revenue will be recognized over a 12- to 24-month period and that recurring revenue builds over time. Given our experience with sales over the last several years and the complexity of the opportunities we are pursuing, we expect sales cycles to remain long and that will have the effect of skewing revenue to the latter part of each year.
Integrated sales were a very strong $71 million in the quarter. Once again, channels and payments were the most popular solutions leading the way to $184 million of integrated sales for the full year or 119% of our 2011 target. Our operational effectiveness results were excellent with $18 million of benefit in the quarter and $45 million for the year, exceeding our 2011 target by 80%.
Our view of market conditions remains generally consistent with that of our third quarter call and Investor Day. 2011 ended with 110 regulatory actions, impacting 92 banks and 18 credit unions, a reduction of about 40% from 2010. As important as the number, institutions impacted by regulatory actions in 2011 were much smaller than in previous years. Over the last 4 years, and contrary to some exaggerated estimates at the peak of the financial crisis, less than 500 financial institutions have been subject to a regulatory action in the United States.
During that period, we lost less than 25 Account Processing clients due to actions which is likely less than if we had been in a more typical M&A environment. In 2012, we expect the number of regulatory actions to continue to decline probably to less than 90 this year. To date, there have been 9 regulatory actions versus 11 last year.
De novo activity continued to be very low with only 3 new charters issued through September 30 and we believe that level of activity will continue in 2012. We anticipate voluntary M&A to be about consistent with its current level. We expect IT budgets to be prioritized to areas that drive revenue, allow ease of movement within and across channels and deepen customer relationships. We believe growth in technology spend will approximately -- approximate the 2011 levels, with a bias towards spending in the second half of the year.
Overall, we believe the end market is solidifying. The questions of institutional survival are increasingly rare and the discussions are now centered on moving forward in a new world of competitive banking. Our key priorities for 2012 remain substantially the same with an added emphasis on aligning our focus against the secular momentum we see in the market.
Guidance for 2012 is based on an assumption that technology spending and the overall environment will be substantially similar to 2011. As I mentioned, we believe there has been a secular change in purchasing behaviors which biases non-time-sensitive technology decisions to later in the year. This change in historic buying patterns should continue to have the effect of pushing more of our sales and revenue growth towards year-end.
For 2012, we expect total adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%. Revenue growth for the year includes a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points from a reduction in revenue due to the Durbin Amendment not sourced through financial institutions.
Overall, we expect our revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. We expect 2012 adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 14% or a range of $5.04 to $5.20 compared to the $4.58 earned in 2011.
Each year, our revenue and EPS guidance incorporates the impact of contract renewals that we expect during the year. Our 2012 guidance for adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS includes an estimate for the range of likely outcomes related to the possibility of an early renewal of our Bank of America bill pay contract. We anticipate that overall adjusted operating margin will increase 50 basis points or more in 2012. We also estimate the free cash flow for 2012 will increase 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be in excess of $5.70 for the full year.
Our 2012 integrated sales target is $200 million and our operational effectiveness objective is $40 million, which will exclude any nonrecurring costs related to the multiyear cost-saving effort.
As I said up front, we had a very strong year. Revenue growth is stepping up, sales results are reinforcing the value of our solutions and we are benefiting from secular momentum in areas of new investment. The experience, talent and commitment of our associates gives us confidence that we will deliver value for years to come.
With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

So whether it is with P2P or Relationship Advance, a series of different products like that, we're having some good success. By the same token, kind of the movement around branches, those kinds of things, you're seeing a lot of energy on the electronic channel side. So Online Banking, we announced a win in the quarter with Navy Federal Credit Union. They've decided that they're going to transform their Internet banking presence, U.S. Bank last year, Westpac the year before that. And so those are just some of the larger institutions. But we're really seeing that energy across as institutions are trying to move both transactions and service to lower-cost channels and mobile is also a derivative of that as well. So lots of energy on that side. And then there's a need for the institutions to start to wire those -- the information and insights that are coming out of those channels together to create a better picture of the experience. So from our standpoint, given that we put so much focus in those areas, we see that being fairly valuable. And then last, I would say that overall, as we see institutions looking to just kind of step down their cost structure, given some of the spread pressures that now appear to extend out through '14, you see vendor consolidation and just general more bundling which, to some extent, gets to some of the larger sales that we've had, but also gets a little bit to the longer implementation cycles."

It's not unusual that a contract of -- actually any of the larger contracts end up getting renewed early. And sometimes in renewals there are discounts, sometimes there not. But what we did is we spent a lot of time to make sure that we had incorporated that range of outcomes so that's in our guidance. So I think mathematically, to the extent that there was a discount given, right? And that certainly is within the range of possibility if there was a discount. If it happened in January, it would likely be larger just mathematically than it would be in December. So from that, I think the math that you're thinking about is likely the right math. We should be clear, right, that we also wanted to try to avoid some negativity that was directed a couple of years ago, or 3 years ago now, when we renewed the Bank of America agreement after we had given guidance. So at this stage, given the expiration in '13, we thought we would be best to incorporate it into our guidance for the year. But let me -- I probably should add one more point.

One of the things that we've -- I guess, I'll say one of the phenomena that we've seen over the last couple of years is in connection with some of the challenges that FIs had, when they're looking to make these investments, they're often looking to reduce cost, their own cost structure to fund some of the investments. So take Internet banking, for example. One of the clients that we announced that we signed this quarter, it’s a very significant transformation of their technology. But we're also going to be hosting that for them. So there are all kinds of intricacies around revenue recognition where you're building and hosting. And from our standpoint, we make those decisions not based on rev rec. We make those decisions on what creates the most value. And so we'd rather have a larger deal even if it creates an issue around us deferring revenue for some period of time. And we do that as -- anytime we have that opportunity, we do that. So to Tom's point, you'll have those kinds of anomalies. But from a cost perspective, beyond the commissions that Tom referenced, and we've had steadily increasing commissions because we've had steadily increasing strong sales performance. I would say that's the only issue. And that's -- to the extent there was any surprise in the fourth quarter, that was probably one of them. Our sales were so strong and that revenue is largely not in the quarter, that created a bit of a mismatch on the commission versus revenue benefit."

We think that -- the environment has become more stable just because more of the rules -- the more the rules are known and people are -- institutions, especially larger ones, are taking action to make sure that they can do what they need to do around growing revenue. But really around growing earnings. So on one hand, we are seeing people spend. On the other hand, we're also seeing some of the larger financial institutions take people-oriented actions and take steps to reduce their cost structure. The benefit that we have and the reason why we probably have more optimism than some is we're quite confident that the areas in which we have been investing in over the last several years, as well as existing solutions like bill payment, they're just not viewed as discretionary. Now I haven't met a single “banker,” right, someone who runs a large institution, whether it's a credit union or a bank, who is willing to defer a mobile decision. People just are not willing to do that and they're really looking for ways to drive revenue. And that, right now, is a good fit for us given where we have chosen to invest over the last several years. Don't get me wrong. I still think there's a lot of -- there's going to be a lot of profitability pressure in financial institutions. I still think we're going to be subject to price compression as we have been. And I don't think there's anywhere near -- wallets being opened up very wide. So from that standpoint, that's why we are taking what I would say a more pragmatic view. We think spend will be about -- I'm sorry, I should clarify, the rate of technology spend growth will be about the same year-over-year.

Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and",909,"Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon. Let me say upfront, 2011 was an excellent year. Revenue growth continued to accelerate on the strength of record sales, differentiated solutions and strong client relationships. We delivered record earnings per share and took important steps to benefit our growth, earnings and capital structure for years to come. We are very well-positioned entering 2012. Our results in the quarter were strong.
Adjusted revenue grew 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% was the highest quarterly performance in nearly 4 years. Our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth continued to climb, increasing 3% in 2011 versus 1% last year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 20% in the quarter to $1.27 and increased 13% to a record $4.58 for the year, $0.04 above the high end of our original EPS range. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year's strong Q4 performance and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was down slightly to 29.2%.
Free cash flow of $734 million was essentially flat due primarily to increased capital expenditures and timing of working capital which we generally expect to reverse. Free cash flow per share increased 5% to $5.09 for the full year.
Free cash flow and free cash flow per share over the last 4 years have grown at a cumulative annual growth rates of 14% and 19%, respectively, reflecting the strength of our business model and consistent execution of our strategies. We allocated over $1 billion in capital in 2011, split about evenly between strategic acquisition and share repurchase.
We also refinanced a large block of our debt at historically low rates while extending our average duration by nearly 50%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain within our targeted debt-to-EBITDA range.
For 2011, we were focused on 3 key priorities: first, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.
Adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated in both segments in 2011. The majority of our growth continues to be from high-quality recurring revenue in our existing businesses. Innovative new solutions such as Mobile, P2P and Acumen are important element of our plan to further accelerate growth and are just beginning to ramp. Adjusted EPS growth of 13% marked our 26th consecutive year of double-digit growth. Earnings grew while investing in these new solutions that should have the dual benefit of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margin.
Fostering a step change in our revenue growth is a rationale for centering the Fiserv culture on growth. The record success of our single sales organization is a proof point to that focus. We have significantly increased our expectations for sales performance in each of the last 2 years, and that's leading to better results.
In 2011, we attained 116% of quota which translates to an absolute increase in sales of 20% over 2010. For those keeping score, you may recall that our absolute sales in the second quarter were the highest in the company's history. Just 6 months later, the fourth quarter sales results set a new high watermark topping the Q2 performance.
We are also seeing increased productivity from our account managers across the company which adds to our ability to more closely match our solutions to the needs of our client base.
Differentiating solutions through innovation that leads to better client results is our highest priority. Financial institutions are rightfully focused on driving revenue and increasing efficiency to restore earnings lost over the last several years. The recent Fed announcement that interest rates are expected to stay extremely low through late 2014 exacerbates that emphasis, with technology playing a key role in solving the revenue and efficiency equation.
During the year, we acquired solutions that strengthened our leadership in channels and payments. First, we acquired M-Com, a global leader in mobile banking and payments, to solidify our position in a rapidly growing market. This allows us to control the development of mobile capabilities and complement our leadership positions in Online Banking, Account Processing and Payments.
We also acquired Maverick solutions to provide financial institutions with a suite of prepaid capabilities to capture new streams of revenue.
And importantly, we acquired CashEdge, the market leader in account-to-account transfer, online account opening and funding, P2P and data aggregation.
Each of these solutions can drive differentiation and revenue for our clients. As we enter 2012, we remain bullish on the opportunity to digitize approximately 11 billion U.S. P2P transactions, totaling $865 billion that are originated each year. Nearly 1,400 financial institutions have signed on to the Fiserv P2P network, which we expect to grow dramatically over the next several years.
We are also beginning to see financial institutions support mass marketing for P2P. For example, NFL fans may have noticed that Citibank ran a 15-second TV spot promoting not P2P, but Popmoney, during a playoff game on January 15 and it's run several times since. We also know that Allied Financial has been advertising Popmoney nationally on the radio. This marketing support has come via our customers and reinforces the belief that P2P enhances their consumer value proposition.
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom to provide more details on our financial results."

As Jeff said up front, adjusted revenue growth was 6% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, the highest since the first quarter of 2008. Strong license sales in our Financial segment drove top and bottom line performance in the quarter as the year-end volume behavior we saw in the last 2 years repeated again in 2011.
Revenue growth accelerated once again in 2011 with full-year adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% compared with 1% last year. Adjusted internal revenue growth improved in both segments. Payments growth was up 1 percentage point to 4% and the Financial segment was up sharply to 3% compared to flat in 2010.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% in the quarter to $1.27 on strong operating performance and grew 13% in the full year to $4.58 which exceeded our original guidance range.
Strong revenue growth in the quarter, much of it from higher-margin solutions, drove adjusted operating income up 7% to a record $325 million for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points which includes an approximate 130-basis-point negative impact from a discretionary profit-sharing accrual and higher commissions related to the record sales performance in the quarter, much of which supports future revenue.
For the full year, adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year as the operating leverage from revenue growth and the success of our operational effectiveness initiatives were offset by investments in new solutions such as Acumen, P2P and Mobiliti, higher expenses in the Corporate segment and the incremental employee compensation expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. Now on to the segment results.
Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 5% to $558 million in the quarter and increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Both year-over-year and sequential growth comparisons were negatively impacted by the completion of the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion, less bill payment processing days in the quarter and a reduction in non-financial institution revenue resulting from the Durbin Amendment.
Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 4% for the full year, as compared to 3% in the prior year. Full income remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 4% in the quarter and 6% in the year excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion. The bulk of this de-conversion will anniversary in the middle of 2012.
Our debit business continued to perform well in the first quarter of the new debit interchange fee structure under Durbin. Debit transaction volume increased 18% in the quarter and 19% in the year, driven by the continued expansion of our client base and the above-market transaction growth experienced by our clients, the great majority of which have assets below the $10 billion threshold of the Durbin legislation.
Operating income in the Payments segment increased 4% in the quarter to $174 million and grew 5% to $656 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 31.2% and decreased 20 basis points for the full year to 31%. The continuing investments in Mobiliti, P2P and Internet banking, along with the incremental employee costs in the quarter, pressured margins. In addition, the CashEdge results had a dilutive impact on segment margin in the quarter and for the full year.
Financial segment adjusted revenue was $540 million in the quarter and $2 billion for the full year, reflecting adjusted internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. As we anticipated, we saw a significant increase in higher margin revenue, such as license fees in the quarter. That result, combined with our steady core Account Processing growth, contributed to the highest quarterly growth rate in our Financial segment in the last 4 years.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up a very strong 11% in the quarter to $178 million. Operating margin expanded by 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.1%, due largely to the expected increase in higher margin revenue.
For the full year, operating income grew 4% to $613 million compared with $591 million in 2010 and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 30.6%.
Operating margin for the full year was positively impacted by continued leverage in our core Account Processing businesses, incremental savings from our operational effectiveness initiatives, increased efficiencies in our Item Processing business, partially offset by solution investments such as Acumen, Relationship Advance and our common loan origination platform.
Our adjusted effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter was in line with expectations and the 36% full-year rate is a healthy improvement over 2010. For 2012, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in line with 2011 at approximately 36%.
In addition to the continuing implementation of focused strategies that have had the cumulative effect of lowering our tax rate for the last couple of years, our rate estimate assumes also the renewal of the R&D credit in 2012.
Free cash flow increased a strong 12% to $227 million in the quarter. Full-year free cash flow was essentially flat at $734 million and was impacted by a $17 million increase in capital expenditures which includes our data center transformation project and changes in working capital.
We had a $60 million increase in accounts receivable versus the comparable prior-year quarter, resulting from our strong revenue finish to the year. We anticipate the year-end spike in accounts receivable in 2011 will convert to cash in 2012, resulting in higher-than-typical free cash flow guidance which Jeff will cover later.
Free cash flow per share grew 5% to $5.09 for the year as a result of our disciplined capital allocation.
We paid off the $120 million in the quarter that have been added to our revolver associated with the acquisition of CashEdge and have a 0 balance on our $1 billion credit facility at year-end. We will also refinance our $1.1 billion term loan which matures in November during 2012.
At this time, we do not anticipate significant interest savings from a refinance given the current rate structure and our bias towards longer term debt maturities as part of our capital structure. We repurchased 8.8 million shares of stock in 2011 for $533 million which included 1 million shares in the fourth quarter for $58 million. This compares favorably to the 8.1 million shares repurchased in 2010 even as we completed several strategic acquisitions during the year. As of December 31, there are 4.7 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."

Full-year sales landed at 116% of quota, an absolute increase of 20%. Sales strength continued in areas aligned with our strategies including significant wins in channels, payments and Account Processing. Examples of our many digital channel wins for the year include Navy Federal Credit Union for Corillian online banking, Regions Bank for Corillian business banking and U.S. Bank for Mobiliti. 
We ended the year signing nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients and are positioned to exceed that number for sales in 2012. We added 435 new bill payment clients, including the return of Zions Bank. We also gained nearly 200 debit clients during the year and had increased the number of clients within the ACCEL/Exchange debit network. Overall in 2011, we recorded more than 1,200 wins in bill payment, debit and P2P.
We're pleased to announce that we inked a multiyear extension of our long-standing reseller relationship with Intuit. In addition to traditional Bill payment services, we're working to enhance those client relationships through a set of payment solutions that should provide value over the next several years. In Account Processing, we continued to win over 50% of all of the competitive deals in the market. Momentum continued to build with 5 Acumen sales deal signed in the quarter and a total of 8 U.S. wins for the year.
As we continue to win larger multiproduct deals, as well as ramp up our newer solutions, we continue to expect that revenue will be recognized over a 12- to 24-month period and that recurring revenue builds over time. Given our experience with sales over the last several years and the complexity of the opportunities we are pursuing, we expect sales cycles to remain long and that will have the effect of skewing revenue to the latter part of each year.
Integrated sales were a very strong $71 million in the quarter. Once again, channels and payments were the most popular solutions leading the way to $184 million of integrated sales for the full year or 119% of our 2011 target. Our operational effectiveness results were excellent with $18 million of benefit in the quarter and $45 million for the year, exceeding our 2011 target by 80%.
Our view of market conditions remains generally consistent with that of our third quarter call and Investor Day. 2011 ended with 110 regulatory actions, impacting 92 banks and 18 credit unions, a reduction of about 40% from 2010. As important as the number, institutions impacted by regulatory actions in 2011 were much smaller than in previous years. Over the last 4 years, and contrary to some exaggerated estimates at the peak of the financial crisis, less than 500 financial institutions have been subject to a regulatory action in the United States.
During that period, we lost less than 25 Account Processing clients due to actions which is likely less than if we had been in a more typical M&A environment. In 2012, we expect the number of regulatory actions to continue to decline probably to less than 90 this year. To date, there have been 9 regulatory actions versus 11 last year.
De novo activity continued to be very low with only 3 new charters issued through September 30 and we believe that level of activity will continue in 2012. We anticipate voluntary M&A to be about consistent with its current level. We expect IT budgets to be prioritized to areas that drive revenue, allow ease of movement within and across channels and deepen customer relationships. We believe growth in technology spend will approximately -- approximate the 2011 levels, with a bias towards spending in the second half of the year.
Overall, we believe the end market is solidifying. The questions of institutional survival are increasingly rare and the discussions are now centered on moving forward in a new world of competitive banking. Our key priorities for 2012 remain substantially the same with an added emphasis on aligning our focus against the secular momentum we see in the market.
Guidance for 2012 is based on an assumption that technology spending and the overall environment will be substantially similar to 2011. As I mentioned, we believe there has been a secular change in purchasing behaviors which biases non-time-sensitive technology decisions to later in the year. This change in historic buying patterns should continue to have the effect of pushing more of our sales and revenue growth towards year-end.
For 2012, we expect total adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%. Revenue growth for the year includes a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points from a reduction in revenue due to the Durbin Amendment not sourced through financial institutions.
Overall, we expect our revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year. We expect 2012 adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 14% or a range of $5.04 to $5.20 compared to the $4.58 earned in 2011.
Each year, our revenue and EPS guidance incorporates the impact of contract renewals that we expect during the year. Our 2012 guidance for adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS includes an estimate for the range of likely outcomes related to the possibility of an early renewal of our Bank of America bill pay contract. We anticipate that overall adjusted operating margin will increase 50 basis points or more in 2012. We also estimate the free cash flow for 2012 will increase 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be in excess of $5.70 for the full year.
Our 2012 integrated sales target is $200 million and our operational effectiveness objective is $40 million, which will exclude any nonrecurring costs related to the multiyear cost-saving effort.
As I said up front, we had a very strong year. Revenue growth is stepping up, sales results are reinforcing the value of our solutions and we are benefiting from secular momentum in areas of new investment. The experience, talent and commitment of our associates gives us confidence that we will deliver value for years to come.
With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

So whether it is with P2P or Relationship Advance, a series of different products like that, we're having some good success. By the same token, kind of the movement around branches, those kinds of things, you're seeing a lot of energy on the electronic channel side. So Online Banking, we announced a win in the quarter with Navy Federal Credit Union. They've decided that they're going to transform their Internet banking presence, U.S. Bank last year, Westpac the year before that. And so those are just some of the larger institutions. But we're really seeing that energy across as institutions are trying to move both transactions and service to lower-cost channels and mobile is also a derivative of that as well. So lots of energy on that side. And then there's a need for the institutions to start to wire those -- the information and insights that are coming out of those channels together to create a better picture of the experience. So from our standpoint, given that we put so much focus in those areas, we see that being fairly valuable. And then last, I would say that overall, as we see institutions looking to just kind of step down their cost structure, given some of the spread pressures that now appear to extend out through '14, you see vendor consolidation and just general more bundling which, to some extent, gets to some of the larger sales that we've had, but also gets a little bit to the longer implementation cycles."

It's not unusual that a contract of -- actually any of the larger contracts end up getting renewed early. And sometimes in renewals there are discounts, sometimes there not. But what we did is we spent a lot of time to make sure that we had incorporated that range of outcomes so that's in our guidance. So I think mathematically, to the extent that there was a discount given, right? And that certainly is within the range of possibility if there was a discount. If it happened in January, it would likely be larger just mathematically than it would be in December. So from that, I think the math that you're thinking about is likely the right math. We should be clear, right, that we also wanted to try to avoid some negativity that was directed a couple of years ago, or 3 years ago now, when we renewed the Bank of America agreement after we had given guidance. So at this stage, given the expiration in '13, we thought we would be best to incorporate it into our guidance for the year. But let me -- I probably should add one more point. We do not -- we're not sitting here today knowing that there is a number, right? It's just a range of different possibilities that we have discussed in terms of formulating our guidance."

We have invested a lot in scaling up our ASP infrastructure. And clearly, that recurring revenue is not really even started to come on yet. And so we have a lot of that infrastructure build that's in this segment along with a lot of investment in P2P and then really in the online channel. We mentioned again another transaction with Navy Federal. We've had really a big ramp-up in our development operation in Online Banking and also in the ASP channel, just a lot of activity there.

It brings in -- for example, it brings in a whole other consumer, potentially a new consumer and a new consumer who likes to transact. We're not fighting at point of sale.

One of the things that we've -- I guess, I'll say one of the phenomena that we've seen over the last couple of years is in connection with some of the challenges that FIs had, when they're looking to make these investments, they're often looking to reduce cost, their own cost structure to fund some of the investments. So take Internet banking, for example. One of the clients that we announced that we signed this quarter, it’s a very significant transformation of their technology. But we're also going to be hosting that for them. So there are all kinds of intricacies around revenue recognition where you're building and hosting. And from our standpoint, we make those decisions not based on rev rec. We make those decisions on what creates the most value. And so we'd rather have a larger deal even if it creates an issue around us deferring revenue for some period of time. And we do that as -- anytime we have that opportunity, we do that. So to Tom's point, you'll have those kinds of anomalies. But from a cost perspective, beyond the commissions that Tom referenced, and we've had steadily increasing commissions because we've had steadily increasing strong sales performance. I would say that's the only issue. And that's -- to the extent there was any surprise in the fourth quarter, that was probably one of them. Our sales were so strong and that revenue is largely not in the quarter, that created a bit of a mismatch on the commission versus revenue benefit."

We think that -- the environment has become more stable just because more of the rules -- the more the rules are known and people are -- institutions, especially larger ones, are taking action to make sure that they can do what they need to do around growing revenue. But really around growing earnings. So on one hand, we are seeing people spend. On the other hand, we're also seeing some of the larger financial institutions take people-oriented actions and take steps to reduce their cost structure. The benefit that we have and the reason why we probably have more optimism than some is we're quite confident that the areas in which we have been investing in over the last several years, as well as existing solutions like bill payment, they're just not viewed as discretionary. Now I haven't met a single “banker,” right, someone who runs a large institution, whether it's a credit union or a bank, who is willing to defer a mobile decision. People just are not willing to do that and they're really looking for ways to drive revenue. And that, right now, is a good fit for us given where we have chosen to invest over the last several years. Don't get me wrong. I still think there's a lot of -- there's going to be a lot of profitability pressure in financial institutions. I still think we're going to be subject to price compression as we have been. And I don't think there's anywhere near -- wallets being opened up very wide. So from that standpoint, that's why we are taking what I would say a more pragmatic view. We think spend will be about -- I'm sorry, I should clarify, the rate of technology spend growth will be about the same year-over-year. But we'll see -- we think it will bias more to the areas in which we're well-suited right now."

On the heels of our strong finish to 2011, we delivered revenue growth and adjusted EPS that exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter.

On the heels of our strong finish to 2011, we delivered revenue growth and adjusted EPS that exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter. We are pleased with our start to the year and are well-positioned to achieve results within our full-year guidance. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, including solid results in both our Payments and Financial segments. Adjusted earnings per share was up 18% for the quarter to $1.20, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2011.
Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, below the outstanding results from the comparative quarter, primarily related to relative changes in working capital. Cash flow remains on track for the year. In February, we reinforced our commitment to building shareholder value with an additional repurchase authorization for 10 million shares. To that end, we also repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter.
We have established 3 key enterprise priorities to help you better gauge our current performance and strategic progress in 2012. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients. Adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% matched our strong fourth quarter performance and accelerated from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Growth in the quarter was driven by recurring revenue in our Debit and Account Processing businesses, along with solid performance across our digital channels, reflecting strong demand for mobile banking solutions and the industry's renewed focus on Online Banking.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, leading to higher operating margin and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Strengthening the foundation of our growth culture leads to better results now and into the future. We are executing against our ongoing market strategy, which is well aligned with technology and consumer trends. As proof points of the market demand, we signed a combined 230 Payments clients to our bill payment, debit and P2P solutions in the quarter, and nearly 150 clients selected our market-leading mobile solution. We also had 2 additional large credit unions create to Acumen, our next-generation Account Processing platform in the quarter. We remain encouraged with a strong interest in this advanced technology platform and as important, the significant number of additional solutions that are being purchased along with the core.
Last week, we hosted over 3,600 attendees at our 2012 Spring Client Event Fiserv Forum. This event will end up being one of the largest gatherings of financial solution executives in the U.S. this year. In addition to having key speakers such as President Bill Clinton and Dr, we have strategy sectors sessions, product forums and user groups. We also hosted a 70,000 square-foot solution center showcasing more than 100 of our leading technology solutions in addition to driving a broad range of value for our clients. The feedback on the event has been outstanding.
Our third priority is to deliver meaningful innovation to help stride differentiation and enhance success for our clients. We announced in February that we will combine the Popmoney and ZashPay P2P payments product and networks and market the enhanced service as Popmoney. The integration will merge the best features of both solutions of both solutions into a common branded interface, provide Best-in-Class risk management and process payments using the same secure and scalable Fiserv technologies that are currently used to move billions of payments. The combined network, which includes some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. has nearly 1,500 enrolled institutions, with combined initial reach of more than 35 million existing online and mobile banking consumer relationships. The reach of the Popmoney network, combined with advanced capabilities such as request money, multiple funding and receipt options and both online and mobile functionality have as very well-positioned to host the largest specialty solution centric P2P network in the country. Lastly, we will also integrate Popmoney into our CheckFree RXP payment suite, which is in use at about 3,600 financial institutions. We expect the migration to be complete by midyear.
At our client conference last week, we conducted multiple live demonstrations of realtime Popmoney transactions via our ACCEL/Exchange PIN-debit Network. These interbank transactions posted directly to and from live bank accounts, and could be viewed in their respective accounts through Online Banking within a matter of only seconds. We expect to begin offering realtime-enabled transactions within the Popmoney network late in 2012. With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,183587764,294218,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth w",843,"Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% for the second consecutive quarter, accelerating from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share increased a very strong 18% to $1.20 in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income grew 6% in the quarter to $296 million and adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 28.7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Scale, which underlies many of our businesses and the continued success of our operational effectiveness initiatives provides us an opportunity to expand margin even as we build out our new solutions.
Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 6% to $545 million. Adjusted internal revenue growth for the quarter was 3%, which is up sequentially from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven primarily by strength in card services, output solutions and digital channels. As expected, the Wachovia Bill payment de-conversion and the Durbin effect on our Biller business had a negative impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion, Bill payment transactions grew 4% in the quarter. The loss of 2 remit-only clients and a decline in volume from a core competitor have formally result CheckFree RXP negatively impacted Bill pay transaction growth by about 300 basis points in the period. Our debit business continued its strong performance, as transactions increased 19% in the quarter. We added 59 new debit clients in the quarter and also expanded the footprint of our ACCEL/Exchange network by winning several larger network deals related to the new Durbin requirements.
Expanding the size of our realtime network is important, both for adding growth in the short-term and increasing in the number of endpoint in compass within our longer-term network strategy.
As seen on Page 7 of the supplemental materials, we will now provide P2P transaction growth each quarter. For the quarter, P2P transactions including Popmoney and ZashPay increased by 126% compared to the prior year period. Although P2P transactions inventory related revenue are still low, tenure clients are seeing more usage and our sales and implementation pipelines continue to grow. P2P was a hot topic at our client conference last week, which heated up even more after the realtime demo.
Operating income for the Payments segment increased 3% to $161 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, down 80 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This was due primarily to increased investments in Online Banking, mobile, the expected margin dilution of the CashEdge acquisition and the Wachovia Bill payment de-conversion. Growth accelerated in the Financial segment as first quarter revenue increased 4% to $501 million over the prior-year period. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4%. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by a recurring revenue in our Account Processing and lending businesses, along with an increase in termination fees. As anticipated, we also saw slowing of the rate of revenue decline in item processing versus the prior year. Financial segment operating income in the quarter increased 9% to $151 million. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 30.2% compared with the prior year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was in line with expectations at 34.5% in the quarter compared with 36.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter of roughly $0.03 compared to last year. We are making good progress on sustainably reducing our tax rate and continue to believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 36% for the full year.
Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, a decrease of $61 million from the prior year, which was our strongest quarter for free cash flow in the last 4 years. Although the net change in working capital was positive in the current quarter, it was far less so than the $77 million positive working capital impact in the prior year comparable quarter. Most of the decrease in the quarter can be attributed to a $32 million increase in cash tax payments and $21 million of increase incentive and profit-sharing payments paid in 2012 for 2011 accruals. As just mentioned up front, we remain on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
All of that at March 31 was $3.4 billion, or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. As I mentioned in our last call, we plan to refinance our $1.1 billion term loan, which matures this November. Given the expected terms of the refinance, we anticipate that our next mandatory debt repayment would be $300 million in October of 2015. We repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. At quarter-end, there were approximately 11 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Following the strongest sales quarter and year in the company's history, sales in the first quarter of 2012 were expectedly slow, attaining 58% of straight-line quota. As part of our growth will focus, sales quota for the year was increased by about 20% over the '11 numbers, which is reflected in the current results. However, our qualified pipeline at the end of the quarter was quite strong, increasing 29% over the same period last year. We expect our momentum to build throughout the year and lead to another strong performance for our world-class sales force.
We also increased our year-over-year integrated sales target by almost 30% to $200 million even. Integrated sales follow the trend of new sales of $32 million in the quarter or 16% of target. Once again, Payments and channel solutions led our results in the quarter. Our operational effectiveness initiatives yield a strong $13 million of savings in the quarter, representing about 1/3 of our annual target.
Before I comment on guidance, let me update you briefly on the environment. As expected, regulatory actions continue to abate in 2012. Through April 27, there have been 27 regulatory actions, 44% reduction from the 48 actions during the same period last year. Total assets have impacted institutions today are down 63% to $7 billion. While Merrill spreads, weak loan demand and sluggish economic growth are conspiring to prolong the tough environment for financial institutions, we believe that the current market is more stable than we have seen over the last year. However, we do expect some volatility throughout the year stable with a net of a slow continuing recovery this year.
Financial institutions remain focused on growing revenue, increasing efficiency, expanding customer relationships and exploring ways to build their business through channel preference and data advantages. Lastly, holistic money movement across all customer types is getting significant attention, which given our product set, should spur additional growth.
As I said up front, we are solidly on track to achieve our full-year financial guidance. Even with our above planned performance in the quarter, we continue to expect much stronger results in the second half of 2012. At this point in the year, we believe that any perceived over performance for the quarter should be considered as de-risking our full-year results. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% for the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share for the year of $5.04 to $5.20, a range of 10% to 14% compared to the $4.58 we earned in 2011. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share of at least $5.70. We're pleased with our start to the year. We are seeing growth opportunities in the market, our industry-leading solutions are in demand and we are layering hearing on high-quality revenue that should recur for years to come. This doesn't just happen. It's a cumulative effort of our 20,000 associates around the world who proved daily the commitment and hard work will indeed translate to superior results to our clients. With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

And we have seen",347,"Well, I think one of the things that's going on within financial institutions is for years, the CheckFree folks and its subsequent dollar acquisition, we have been touting the retention kind of adaptive relationship benefits of Bill pay. And we have seen several larger institutions putting real muscle behind that to try to gain larger shares of wallet. So I think that's one thing. And that's a continuation of trends that we had seen at Bank of America. I think Bank of America really built their business in understanding that, and that's one of the reasons why they've grown so large over the years. The second thing that frankly, we're beginning to see, but it's early, is we -- the growth in this -- in the Bill payment business has -- goes in spurts and now that we're seeing mobile takeoff, we're seeing both people use -- people who were Bill pay users begin to use mobile to supplement their online behavior but more importantly as mobile is growing in its reach, we see new consumers coming on. We're seeing very, very strong performance in Bill pay in the mobile banking channel. In fact, what we can see right now is by far, Bill payment is the technology that is getting the highest amount of utilization in the mobile space. And because we have those 2 solutions together, we think that there's a bit of an embedded advantage. Third, which I think it's premature, it's all starting to talk a little bit more about the future, Julio, but we do believe that Bill payment, especially with the addition of P2P, will begin to rise faster as people get more and more used to paying their bills online. And even today, of the $20 billion or so bills that are in the U.S. there's less than $2 billion paid electronically through bank aggregators. And even if you add direct payment website, you still have probably 70, 60% to 70% of the bills still being made or payments being made using paper. So there's still a long runway there."

So we are tracking in a manner that's consistent with the way that we laid that out. From a demand perspective, I would say that we are seeing the demand look again, about where we thought it would be across each of the different solutions. I would say that demand in the CashEdge suite and specifically on the small business product, has probably been a little bit better than we thought. And again, maybe there's a small offset because we had a little bit of a slowdown in the sales pipe. But our implementation, as Tom mentioned, our implementation pipeline is strong and our sales pipeline is strong.

We actually feel really good about the number of institutions that we ended up signing on that front. And the term of art around several was really around institutions larger than $10 billion so the nonexempt institutions that are not, our debit processing clients. So clients for which we are not doing their debit work today have then agreed to bring us in as their -- either on a second brand or a primary brand. So we've made some really good progress. The other reason why we're being a little bit broader on this is, there are a lot of variables out there right now. It depends on how much it second network, how much volume comes over to the second network. What ends up with the merchants in terms of how they decide to route transactions. Obviously, some of the very large merchants are taking more control on their routing. But one of the underlying benefits that we're picking up in here is that as we mentioned around the realtime, one of the strategies that we laid out, Glenn, at our Investor Day back in October was the ability to use ACCEL exchange, use that PIN-debit Network to do realtime. And we're really excited about the fact that we were able to why demo the interbank transactions, right? So 2 separate banks, transactions will be moving in a number of seconds. And so the more people we have at our primary PIN-debit Network, of course, will likely go out and set of relationships with the other networks. But within our PIN-debit Network, we're going to have more control. And we literally picked up millions of new debit relationships through these several clients. So we feel like not just set ourselves up for some more growth this year, but continue to build that network potential because it's not just P2P that has realtime opportunity. There are other payment mechanisms, other ways to expedite payments that we're working on that are quite exciting. And we'll deliver premium pricing to the financial institutions and then of course, some incremental benefit to us."

On the heels of our strong finish to 2011, we delivered revenue growth and adjusted EPS that exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter.

On the heels of our strong finish to 2011, we delivered revenue growth and adjusted EPS that exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter. We are pleased with our start to the year and are well-positioned to achieve results within our full-year guidance.
Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, including solid results in both our Payments and Financial segments. Adjusted earnings per share was up 18% for the quarter to $1.20, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2011.
Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, below the outstanding results in the comparative quarter, primarily related to relative changes in working capital. Cash flow remains on track for the year. In February, we reinforced our commitment to building shareholder value through an additional repurchase authorization for 10 million shares. To that end, we also repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter.
We have established 3 key enterprise priorities to help you better gauge our current performance and strategic progress in 2012. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients. Adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% matched our strong fourth quarter performance and accelerated from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Growth in the quarter was driven by recurring revenue in our Debit and Account Processing businesses, along with solid performance across our digital channels, reflecting strong demand for mobile banking solutions and the industry's renewed focus on Online Banking.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, leading to higher operating margin and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Strengthening the foundation of our growth culture leads to better results now and into the future. We are executing against our go-to-market strategy, which is well aligned with technology and consumer trends.
As proof points of the market demand, we signed a combined 230 Payments clients to our bill payment, debit and P2P solutions in the quarter, and nearly 150 clients selected our market-leading mobile solution. We also had 2 additional large credit unions commit to Acumen, our next-generation account processing platform in the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strong interest in this advanced technology platform, and as important, the significant number of additional solutions that are being purchased along with the core.
Last week, we hosted over 3,600 attendees at our 2012 spring client event, Fiserv Forum. This event will end up being one of the largest gatherings of financial institution executives in the U.S. this year. In addition to having marquee speakers such as President Bill Clinton and Dr. Fareed Zakaria, we had strategy sessions, product forums and user groups. We also hosted a 70,000 square-foot solution center showcasing more than 100 of our leading technology solutions geared at driving a broad range of value for our clients. The feedback on the event has been outstanding.
Our third priority is to deliver meaningful innovation that helps drive differentiation and enhance success for our clients. We announced in February that we will combine the Popmoney and ZashPay P2P payments product and networks and market the enhanced service as Popmoney. The integration will merge the best features of both solutions into a common branded interface, provide best-in-class risk management and process payments using the same secure and scalable Fiserv technologies that are currently used to move billions of payments.
The combined network, which includes some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S., has nearly 1,500 enrolled institutions, with combined initial reach of more than 35 million existing online and mobile banking consumer relationships. The reach of the Popmoney network, combined with advanced capabilities such as request money, multiple funding and receipt options and both online and mobile functionality, have us very well-positioned to host the largest financial institution-centric P2P network in the country. Lastly, we will also integrate Popmoney into our CheckFree RXP payment suite, which is in use at about 3,600 financial institutions. We expect the migration to be complete by midyear.
At our client conference last week, we conducted multiple live demonstrations of realtime Popmoney transactions via our ACCEL/Exchange PIN debit network. These interbank transactions posted directly to and from live bank accounts, and could be viewed in their respective accounts through Online Banking within a matter of only seconds. We expect to begin offering realtime-enabled transactions within the Popmoney network late in 2012.
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,183587764,294409,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth",843,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% for the second consecutive quarter, accelerating from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share increased a very strong 18% to $1.20 in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income grew 6% in the quarter to $296 million and adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 28.7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Scale, which underlies many of our businesses, and the continued success of our operational effectiveness initiatives, provides us an opportunity to expand margin even as we build out our new solutions.
Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 6% to $545 million. Adjusted internal revenue growth for the quarter was 3%, which is up sequentially from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven primarily by strength in card services, output solutions and digital channels. As expected, the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion and the Durbin effect on our Biller business had a negative impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion, bill payment transactions grew 4% in the quarter.
The loss of 2 remit-only clients and a decline in volume from a core competitor have formally result CheckFree RXP negatively impacted bill pay transaction growth by about 300 basis points in the period. Our debit business continued its strong performance, as transactions increased 19% in the quarter.
We added 59 new debit clients in the quarter and also expanded the footprint of our ACCEL/Exchange network by winning several larger network deals related to the new Durbin requirements. Expanding the size of our realtime network is important, both for adding growth in the short term and increasing in the number of endpoints encompass within our longer-term network strategy.
As seen on Page 7 of the supplemental materials, we will now provide P2P transaction growth each quarter. For the quarter, P2P transactions, including Popmoney and ZashPay, increased by 126% compared to the prior year period. Although P2P transactions and the related revenue are still low, tenured clients are seeing more usage, and our sales and implementation pipelines continue to grow. P2P was a hot topic in our client conference last week, which heated up even more after the realtime demos.
Operating income for the Payments segment increased 3% to $161 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, down 80 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This was due primarily to increased investments in Online Banking, mobile, the expected margin dilution of the CashEdge acquisition and the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion.
Growth accelerated in the Financial segment as first quarter revenue increased 4% to $501 million over the prior-year period. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4%. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by recurring revenue in our Account Processing and Lending businesses, along with an increase in termination fees. As anticipated, we also saw slowing of the rate of revenue decline in item processing versus the prior year. Financial segment operating income in the quarter increased 9% to $151 million. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 30.2% compared with the prior year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was in line with expectations at 34.5% in the quarter compared with 36.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter of roughly $0.03 compared to last year. We are making good progress on sustainably reducing our tax rate and continue to believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 36% for the full year.
Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, a decrease of $61 million from the prior year, which was our strongest quarter for free cash flow in the last 4 years. Although the net change in working capital was positive in the current quarter, it was far less so than the $77 million positive working capital impact in the prior year comparable quarter. Most of the decrease in the quarter can be attributed to a $32 million increase in cash tax payments and $21 million of increase incentive and profit-sharing payments paid in 2012 for 2011 accruals. As Jeff mentioned up front, we remain on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
All of that at March 31 was $3.4 billion, or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. As I mentioned in our last call, we plan to refinance our $1.1 billion term loan, which matures this November. Given the expected terms of the refinance, we anticipate that our next mandatory debt repayment would be $300 million in October of 2015. We repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. At quarter-end, there were approximately 11 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Following the strongest sales quarter and year in the company's history, sales in the first quarter of 2012 were expectedly slow, attaining 58% of straight-line quota. As part of our growth focus, sales quota for the year was increased by about 20% over the '11 numbers, which is reflected in the current results. However, our qualified pipeline at the end of the quarter was quite strong, increasing 29% over the same period last year. We expect our momentum to build throughout the year and lead to another strong performance for our world-class sales force.
We also increased our year-over-year integrated sales target by almost 30% to $200 million even. Integrated sales followed the trend of new sales of $32 million in the quarter or 16% of target. Once again, Payments and channel solutions led our results in the quarter. Our operational effectiveness initiatives yield a strong $13 million of savings in the quarter, representing about 1/3 of our annual target.
Before I comment on guidance, let me update you briefly on the environment. As expected, regulatory actions continue to abate in 2012. Through April 27, there have been 27 regulatory actions, 44% reduction from the 48 actions during the same period last year. Total assets have impacted institutions to date are down 63% to $7 billion. While narrow spreads, weak loan demand and sluggish economic growth are conspiring to prolong the tough environment for financial institutions, we believe the current market is more stable than we have seen over the last year. However, we do expect some volatility throughout the year with the net of a slow continuing recovery this year.
Financial institutions remain focused on growing revenue, increasing efficiency, expanding customer relationships and exploring ways to build their business through channel preference and data advantages. Lastly, holistic money movement across all customer types is getting significant attention, which given our product set, should spur additional growth.
As I said up front, we are solidly on track to achieve our full-year financial guidance. Even with our above-planned performance in the quarter, we continue to expect much stronger results in the second half of 2012. At this point in the year, we believe that any perceived over performance for the quarter should be considered as de-risking our full-year results. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth 3% to 4.5% for the year.
We expect adjusted earnings per share for the year of $5.04 to $5.20, a range of 10% to 14% compared to the $4.58 we earned in 2011. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share of at least $5.70. We're pleased with our start to the year. We are seeing growth opportunities in the market, our industry-leading solutions are in demand and we are layering on high-quality revenue that should recur for years to come. This doesn't just happen. It's the cumulative effort of our 20,000 associates around the world who prove daily the commitment and hard work do indeed translate to superior results for our clients.
With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

And we have seen",349,"Well, I think one of the things that's going on within financial institutions is for years, the CheckFree folks and its subsequent dollar acquisition, we have been touting the retention kind of adaptive relationship benefits of bill pay. And we have seen several larger institutions putting real muscle behind that to try to gain larger shares of wallet. So I think that's one thing. And that's a continuation of trends that we had seen at Bank of America. I think Bank of America really built their business in understanding that, and that's one of the reasons why they've grown so large over the years. The second thing that frankly, we're beginning to see, but it's early, is we -- the growth in this -- in the Bill payment business has -- goes in spurts and now that we're seeing mobile takeoff, we're seeing both people use -- people who were bill pay users begin to use mobile to supplement their online behavior, but more importantly, as mobile is growing in its reach, we see new consumers coming on. We're seeing very, very strong performance in bill pay in the mobile banking channel. In fact, what we can see right now is by far, Bill payment is the technology that is getting the highest amount of utilization in the mobile space. And because we have those 2 solutions together, we think that there's a bit of an embedded advantage. Third, which I think it's premature, so I'm starting to talk a little bit more about the future, Julio, but we do believe that bill payment, especially with the addition of P2P, will begin to rise faster as people get more and more used to paying their bills online. And even today, of the $20 billion or so bills that are in the U.S., there's less than $2 billion paid electronically through bank aggregators. And even if you add direct payment at website, you still have probably 70% -- 60% to 70% of the bills still being made or payments being made using paper. So there's still a long runway there."

We actually feel really good about the number of institutions that we ended up signing on that front. And the term of art around several was really around institutions larger than $10 billion, so the nonexempt institutions that are not our debit processing clients. So clients for which we are not doing their debit work today have then agreed to bring us in as their -- either on a second brand or a primary brand. So we've made some good progress. The other reason why we're being a little bit broader on this is, is there are a lot of variables out there right now. It depends on how much -- if we're a second network, how much volume comes over on the second network. What ends up with the merchants in terms of how they decide to route transactions. Obviously, some of the very large merchants are taking more control on their routing. But one of the underlying benefits that we're picking up in here is that as we mentioned around the realtime, one of the strategies that we laid out, Glenn, at our Investor Day back in October, was the ability to use ACCEL exchange, use that PIN debit network to do realtime. And we're really excited about the fact that we were able to live demo the interbank transactions, right? So 2 separate banks, transactions moving in a matter of seconds. And so the more people we have in our primary PIN debit network, of course, we'll likely go out and set up relationships with the other networks. But within our PIN debit network, we're going to have more control. And we literally picked up millions of new debit relationships through these several clients. So we feel like we've not just set ourselves up for some more growth this year, but continue to build that network potential because it's not just P2P that has realtime opportunity, there are other payment mechanisms, other ways to expedite payments that we're working on that are quite exciting. And we'll deliver premium pricing to the financial institutions and then of course, some incremental benefit to us."

The only caveat that I would give you is in the 6.5 years or so that I've been here, I have, at times, heard that deals will get done and they end up slipping a bit, they end up getting done almost every single time, but sometimes they slipped. So I don't think this a kind of thing where you're going to have to wait until the fourth quarter for us to get on track."

And so we have to take the appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure as appropriate in those particular areas and as to redeploy these resources then into other areas of growth that we've talked about, whether that be mobile or Acumen or Online Banking, et cetera. So we have one of these charges in the first quarter of last year. We are going to have them from time to time, not necessarily from a size standpoint every year or every first quarter. But we will continually, over the next 3 to 5 years, continue to adjust our cost structure as appropriate going forward."

And you can also see that in this quarter, we had $13 million of saves to -- due to the operational effectiveness program. That's $9 million higher than it was last year in the same quarter. So we are seeing those benefits getting added in to our P&L.

On the heels of our strong finish to 2011, we delivered revenue growth and adjusted EPS that exceeded our internal expectations for the quarter. We are pleased with our start to the year and are well-positioned to achieve results within our full-year guidance.
Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and adjusted internal revenue growth was 4%, including solid results in both our Payments and Financial segments. Adjusted earnings per share was up 18% for the quarter to $1.20, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points over the first quarter of 2011.
Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, below the outstanding results in the comparative quarter, primarily related to relative changes in working capital. Cash flow remains on track for the year. In February, we reinforced our commitment to building shareholder value through an additional repurchase authorization for 10 million shares. To that end, we also repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter.
We have established 3 key enterprise priorities to help you better gauge our current performance and strategic progress in 2012. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients. Adjusted internal revenue growth of 4% matched our strong fourth quarter performance and accelerated from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Growth in the quarter was driven by recurring revenue in our Debit and Account Processing businesses, along with solid performance across our digital channels, reflecting strong demand for mobile banking solutions and the industry's renewed focus on Online Banking.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, leading to higher operating margin and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Strengthening the foundation of our growth culture leads to better results now and into the future. We are executing against our go-to-market strategy, which is well aligned with technology and consumer trends.
As proof points of the market demand, we signed a combined 230 Payments clients to our bill payment, debit and P2P solutions in the quarter, and nearly 150 clients selected our market-leading mobile solution. We also had 2 additional large credit unions commit to Acumen, our next-generation account processing platform in the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strong interest in this advanced technology platform, and as important, the significant number of additional solutions that are being purchased along with the core.
Last week, we hosted over 3,600 attendees at our 2012 spring client event, Fiserv Forum. This event will end up being one of the largest gatherings of financial institution executives in the U.S. this year. In addition to having marquee speakers such as President Bill Clinton and Dr. Fareed Zakaria, we had strategy sessions, product forums and user groups. We also hosted a 70,000 square-foot solution center showcasing more than 100 of our leading technology solutions geared at driving a broad range of value for our clients. The feedback on the event has been outstanding.
Our third priority is to deliver meaningful innovation that helps drive differentiation and enhance success for our clients. We announced in February that we will combine the Popmoney and ZashPay P2P payments product and networks and market the enhanced service as Popmoney. The integration will merge the best features of both solutions into a common branded interface, provide best-in-class risk management and process payments using the same secure and scalable Fiserv technologies that are currently used to move billions of payments.
The combined network, which includes some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S., has nearly 1,500 enrolled institutions, with combined initial reach of more than 35 million existing online and mobile banking consumer relationships. The reach of the Popmoney network, combined with advanced capabilities such as request money, multiple funding and receipt options and both online and mobile functionality, have us very well-positioned to host the largest financial institution-centric P2P network in the country. Lastly, we will also integrate Popmoney into our CheckFree RXP payment suite, which is in use at about 3,600 financial institutions. We expect the migration to be complete by midyear.
At our client conference last week, we conducted multiple live demonstrations of realtime Popmoney transactions via our ACCEL/Exchange PIN debit network. These interbank transactions posted directly to and from live bank accounts, and could be viewed in their respective accounts through Online Banking within a matter of only seconds. We expect to begin offering realtime-enabled transactions within the Popmoney network late in 2012.
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,183587764,294489,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth",842,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, our strong start to the year for revenue and earnings growth was ahead of our planned results for the quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 5% to $1.03 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% for the second consecutive quarter, accelerating from 3% in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share increased a very strong 18% to $1.20 in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income grew 6% in the quarter to $296 million and adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 28.7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. Scale, which underlies many of our businesses, and the continued success of our operational effectiveness initiatives, provides us an opportunity to expand margin even as we build out our new solutions.
Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 6% to $545 million. Adjusted internal revenue growth for the quarter was 3%, which is up sequentially from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven primarily by strength in card services, output solutions and digital channels. As expected, the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion and the Durbin effect on our Biller business had a negative impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Wachovia de-conversion, bill payment transactions grew 4% in the quarter.
The loss of 2 remit-only clients and a decline in volume from a core competitor that formerly resold CheckFree RXP negatively impacted bill pay transaction growth by about 300 basis points in the period. Our debit business continued its strong performance, as transactions increased 19% in the quarter.
We added 59 new debit clients in the quarter and also expanded the footprint of our ACCEL/Exchange network by winning several larger network deals related to the new Durbin requirements. Expanding the size of our realtime network is important, both for adding growth in the short term and increasing in the number of endpoints encompass within our longer-term network strategy.
As seen on Page 7 of the supplemental materials, we will now provide P2P transaction growth each quarter. For the quarter, P2P transactions, including Popmoney and ZashPay, increased by 126% compared to the prior year period. Although P2P transactions and the related revenue are still low, tenured clients are seeing more usage, and our sales and implementation pipelines continue to grow. P2P was a hot topic in our client conference last week, which heated up even more after the realtime demos.
Operating income for the Payments segment increased 3% to $161 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, down 80 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This was due primarily to increased investments in Online Banking, mobile, the expected margin dilution of the CashEdge acquisition and the Wachovia bill payment de-conversion.
Growth accelerated in the Financial segment as first quarter revenue increased 4% to $501 million over the prior-year period. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4%. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by recurring revenue in our Account Processing and Lending businesses, along with an increase in termination fees. As anticipated, we also saw slowing of the rate of revenue decline in item processing versus the prior year. Financial segment operating income in the quarter increased 9% to $151 million. Operating margin increased 130 basis points to 30.2% compared with the prior year.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was in line with expectations at 34.5% in the quarter compared with 36.3% in the first quarter of 2011. This resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter of roughly $0.03 compared to last year. We are making good progress on sustainably reducing our tax rate and continue to believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 36% for the full year.
Free cash flow was $183 million in the quarter, a decrease of $61 million from the prior year, which was our strongest quarter for free cash flow in the last 4 years. Although the net change in working capital was positive in the current quarter, it was far less so than the $77 million positive working capital impact in the prior year comparable quarter. Most of the decrease in the quarter can be attributed to a $32 million increase in cash tax payments and $21 million of increase incentive and profit-sharing payments paid in 2012 for 2011 accruals. As Jeff mentioned up front, we remain on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.
Old debt at March 31 was $3.4 billion, or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. As I mentioned in our last call, we plan to refinance our $1.1 billion term loan, which matures this November. Given the expected terms of the refinance, we anticipate that our next mandatory debt repayment would be $300 million in October of 2015. We repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. At quarter-end, there were approximately 11 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Following the strongest sales quarter and year in the company's history, sales in the first quarter of 2012 were expectedly slow, attaining 58% of straight-line quota. As part of our growth focus, sales quota for the year was increased by about 20% over the '11 numbers, which is reflected in the current results. However, our qualified pipeline at the end of the quarter was quite strong, increasing 29% over the same period last year. We expect our momentum to build throughout the year and lead to another strong performance for our world-class sales force.
We also increased our year-over-year integrated sales target by almost 30% to $200 million even. Integrated sales followed the trend of new sales of $32 million in the quarter or 16% of target. Once again, Payments and channel solutions led our results in the quarter. Our operational effectiveness initiatives yield a strong $13 million of savings in the quarter, representing about 1/3 of our annual target.
Before I comment on guidance, let me update you briefly on the environment. As expected, regulatory actions continue to abate in 2012. Through April 27, there have been 27 regulatory actions, 44% reduction from the 48 actions during the same period last year. Total assets have impacted institutions to date are down 63% to $7 billion. While narrow spreads, weak loan demand and sluggish economic growth are conspiring to prolong the tough environment for financial institutions, we believe the current market is more stable than we have seen over the last year. However, we do expect some volatility throughout the year with the net of a slow continuing recovery this year.
Financial institutions remain focused on growing revenue, increasing efficiency, expanding customer relationships and exploring ways to build their business through channel preference and data advantages. Lastly, holistic money movement across all customer types is getting significant attention, which given our product set, should spur additional growth.
As I said up front, we are solidly on track to achieve our full year financial guidance. Even with our above-planned performance in the quarter, we continue to expect much stronger results in the second half of 2012. At this point in the year, we believe that any perceived over performance for the quarter should be considered as de-risking our full year results. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth 3% to 4.5% for the year.
We expect adjusted earnings per share for the year of $5.04 to $5.20, a range of 10% to 14% compared to the $4.58 we earned in 2011. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share of at least $5.70. We're pleased with our start to the year. We are seeing growth opportunities in the market, our industry-leading solutions are in demand and we are layering on high-quality revenue that should recur for years to come. This doesn't just happen. It's the cumulative effort of our 20,000 associates around the world who prove daily the commitment and hard work do indeed translate to superior results for our clients.
With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

And we have seen seve",349,"Well, I think one of the things that's going on within financial institutions is for years, the CheckFree folks and subsequent to our acquisition, we have been touting the retention kind of adaptive relationship benefits of bill pay. And we have seen several larger institutions putting real muscle behind that to try to gain larger shares of wallet. So I think that's one thing. And that's a continuation of trends that we had seen at Bank of America. I think Bank of America really built their business in understanding that, and that's one of the reasons why they've grown so large over the years. The second thing that frankly, we're beginning to see, but it's early, is we -- the growth in this -- in the Bill payment business has -- goes in spurts and now that we're seeing mobile takeoff, we're seeing both people use -- people who were bill pay users begin to use mobile to supplement their online behavior, but more importantly, as mobile is growing in its reach, we see new consumers coming on. We're seeing very, very strong performance in bill pay in the mobile banking channel. In fact, what we can see right now is by far, Bill payment is the technology that is getting the highest amount of utilization in the mobile space. And because we have those 2 solutions together, we think that there's a bit of an embedded advantage. Third, which I think it's premature, so I'm starting to talk a little bit more about the future, Julio, but we do believe that bill payment, especially with the addition of P2P, will begin to rise faster as people get more and more used to paying their bills online. And even today, of the $20 billion or so bills that are in the U.S., there's less than $2 billion paid electronically through bank aggregators. And even if you add direct payment at website, you still have probably 70% -- 60% to 70% of the bills still being made or payments being made using paper. So there's still a long runway there."

I would say that demand in the CashEdge suite, and specifically on the small business product, has probably been a little bit better than we thought. And again, maybe there's a small offset because we had a little bit of a slowdown in the sales pipe.

I think we used -- the term of art that we used on that was several. Just to not put a definitive number out there because we're still -- actually one of the reasons why our pipeline is strong is we actually have a fair amount of activity still out there even though we've come and past April 1, there's still a fair amount of activity in the market. We actually feel really good about the number of institutions that we ended up signing on that front. And the term of art around several was really around institutions larger than $10 billion, so the nonexempt institutions that are not our debit processing clients. So clients for which we are not doing their debit work today have then agreed to bring us in as their -- either on a second brand or a primary brand. So we've made some good progress. The other reason why we're being a little bit broader on this is, is there are a lot of variables out there right now. It depends on how much -- if we're a second network, how much volume comes over on the second network. What ends up with the merchants in terms of how they decide to route transactions. Obviously, some of the very large merchants are taking more control on their routing. But one of the underlying benefits that we're picking up in here is that as we mentioned around the realtime, one of the strategies that we laid out, Glenn, at our Investor Day back in October, was the ability to use ACCEL exchange, use that PIN debit network to do realtime. And we're really excited about the fact that we were able to live demo the interbank transactions, right? So 2 separate banks, transactions moving in a matter of seconds. And so the more people we have in our primary PIN debit network, of course, we'll likely go out and set up relationships with the other networks. But within our PIN debit network, we're going to have more control. And we literally picked up millions of new debit relationships through these several clients. So we feel like we've not just set ourselves up for some more growth this year, but continue to build that network potential because it's not just P2P that has realtime opportunity, there are other payment mechanisms, other ways to expedite payments that we're working on that are quite exciting. And we'll deliver premium pricing to the financial institutions and then of course, some incremental benefit to us."

But are you in a situation here, where after the strong bookings we saw for a few quarters, if you have to go to a period of rebuilding of the pipeline before you start seeing good bookings again? In other words, that quota attainment, is that going to be anywhere close to 100% or better until the end of the year or should we expect a recovery soon?"

And so it leaves you with a weaker position in the beginning of the year. Now that combined with the fact that we continue to notch up expectations, that's a really important point in raising quota around 20% year-over-year, and that's a big deal. So from that standpoint, I would say, we certainly had those 2 issues working against us. But I would also say that, as Tom, I think, referenced earlier in Q&A, it doesn't take much, right? If a good-sized deal ends up slipping from March 30 to April 30, things can move a lot. I mean, we feel very good about our pipeline and actually our further weighted pipeline is even stronger, right, on a year-over-year basis. So we think we will make some important progress between now and the next time we announce results. The only caveat that I would give you is in the 6.5 years or so that I've been here, I have, at times, heard that deals will get done and they end up slipping a bit, they end up getting done almost every single time, but sometimes they slipped.

We again, generated strong earnings growth in the quarter, with adjusted EPS increasing 13% to $1.28 and is up 15% to $2.48 for the first half of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the quarter and 4% through June 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and is 2% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was 29.3% in the quarter consistent with the prior year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 29% year-to-date, led by very strong performance in the Financial segment. Free cash flow increased 26% in the quarter to $115 million, compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow is down 11% to $298 million primarily related to higher tax payments.
Strong sales in the quarter, led to second highest results in the company's history, only the fourth quarter of 2011 was higher. On balance, we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year, which are in line at our expectations. We continue to expect and are on track for stronger second half results. We should lead to another year of solid growth and financial performance.
That said, we do recognize that there is more variability in our results in this quarter than is typical, which merits further explanation. There are 3 areas, 2 of which are generally timing related, which impacted our second quarter results. First, the timing of license and termination fees pressured our second quarter growth rate by just over 1%. The swing from the first quarter's results, which has been positively impacted by just under 1%. And although these steps of revenue are less than 5% of the company total, on the margin, a few million dollars can be the growth rate in a quarter. Second, we were impacted by several large intricate client implementations, primarily in our online channel business where significant increases in scope and project duration shifted the timing of revenue from this period to out over the next several quarters.
The last is the impact of several unusual bill payment deconversions, primarily Wachovia, which we have discussed for a couple of quarters within the Payments segment. These impacts were largely anniversaried by the end of the third quarter. The cumulative impact of these items on the company's internal revenue growth rate in the quarter was approximately 2.5 percentage points and approximately 1 percentage point for the year-to-date. The majority of the impact is in the Payments segment. These items are also compressing margin commensurately. Tom will provide more color in his discussion about financial results. As we shared at the beginning of the year, we are focused on 3 key enterprise priorities in 2012, which more fully represent our formula to create sustainable shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality earnings growth and meet our revenue commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhance our results for our clients.
Revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was driven by steady increases in recurring revenue across a number of our traditional businesses including debit, account processing and lending. The operating leveraging in these recurring revenue businesses combined with the continued progress of our operational effectiveness initiatives resulted in 4% growth in adjusted operating income and 20 basis points in margin expansion in the first half of the year, despite the second quarter impact, I just discussed. Adjusted EPS through June 30 has increased 15% and we're on track to extend our streak of 26 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our focus on enhancing our growth culture led to strong sales performance in the quarter. As you know, we announced the deal today with TD Bank, which is the largest electronic bill payment win in our history outside of the Bank of America transaction in 2000. This competitive takeaway highlights the product advantages and network scale that will allow TD to provide world-class Bill payment and eagle services to their customers as part of a differentiated online experience. Increasingly, the largest financial institutions in the U.S. are turning to Fiserv for an integrated suite of our leading channel and payment solutions to help them harness the power of the digital movement.
Speaking of which, we're making great progress adding scale to our new solutions such as P2P, where we have now signed 14 of the top 30 banks in the U.S. and total of over 1,600 institutions. Our P2P sales pipeline with leading banks and credit unions continues to be very strong. We signed over 400 bill payment debit P2P and mobile banking clients in the quarter, driven largely by existing leaderships in our market-leading account processing client base. We now have over 1,100 clients signed from Mobiliti, with over 750 live as of June 30. As users and transactions accelerate, they should have an even larger positive effect on our revenue growth rate. We had a great quarter against our priority of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for clients. In June, we successfully combined our 2 P2P products, creating a single integrated solution and network under the Popmoney brand, along with enhanced functionality and multiple payment options. In addition, Popmoney has now integrated and available within the CheckFree RXP payment suite and use it more than 3,800 financial institutions. Within the currently signed Popmoney network, we have the potential to access more than 40 million online and mobile banking relationships across the 1,600 institutions. This continuing optimism around the financial industries a desire to drive value to consumers and small businesses through a well featured P2P solution and scaled network. We have dedicated significant resources to this integration and are pleased with it's success.
We also launched our ASP version of relationship advance at a regional bank in the quarter. As you may recall from last year's investor conference, relationship advance is a deposit based lending technology solution that enables financial institutions to offer their customers small dollar loans through Online Banking, at a much lower cost than would be available in traditional channel. The ASP-based system streamlines the process, provides immediate customer approval and funding and offers flexible pricing and repayment alternatives.
Lastly, Truestone Financial Federal Credit Union went live on Acumen, our next-generation credit union account processing solution in early July. Their new integrated core account system include a suite of channel and payment solutions reaching it's more than 60,000 members such as Corillian Online, Mobiliti, Popmoney and CheckFree RXP. The success of the Truestone conversion, especially given the complex integration of about 30 internal and external solutions, is a significant milestone for Acumen in the U.S. market. With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom who will provide more detail in our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion, an increase 4% in the first 6 months of 2012, to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date.",1420,"Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion, an increase 4% in the first 6 months of 2012, to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date. As Jeff highlighted earlier, there were timing impacts in the second quarter, with license and termination fees, revenue related to large customer implementations and also lower bill payment revenue, primarily attributable to the Wachovia deconversion. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.28 in the quarter and has increased 15% to $2.48 through June 30. The Q2 earnings per share results excludes a positive discrete tax benefit of $0.10 per share that was recognized for GAAP purposes. This adjustment results in a full year rate, which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual adjusted effective tax rate.
Adjusted operating income was $302 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 29.3%, consistent with the second quarter of 2011, and up 60 basis points sequentially, which is compelling considering the 80 basis point negative impact of the quarter related to the decline in license and termination fee revenue the. For the first 6 months, adjusted operating income increased 4% to $598 million and adjusted operating margin improved by 20 basis points to 29% compared with the prior-year period. Now onto the segment results.
Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $538 million in the quarter and increased 5% to $1.1 billion in the first 6 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and 2% through June 30. Card services and output solutions continued to drive revenue growth, both in the quarter and year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by a reduction in Bill payment revenue attributable to the deconversion of Wachovia, our core competitor that formerly resold check rate and 2 remittance-only clients, which negatively impacted revenue growth in the segment by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of the Bill payment clients I just mentioned, Bill payment transactions increased 3% in the quarter and were up 5% year-to-date. At this point, the substantial majority of the comparable bill payment rollover is behind us. The combination of our recent large CheckFree RXP and a strong pipeline of new deals should boost the revenue growth rate nicely in this business.
Also, the timing of software license revenue, large services implementations and Durbin implications in our biller business, negatively impacted year-over-year segment revenue growth by approximately 160 basis points. This, combined with the Bill payment deconversions had a combined impact of more than 3 percentage points on the Payments segment growth rate in the quarter.
The other transaction growth of 16% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date was a result of better than market transaction growth, as well as the onboarding of new clients. We added 93 new debit clients over the first 6 months of the year, roughly on par with last year's level. Renewal activity has remained strong, car growth has continued, and volume growth picked up in July compared with the second quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we successfully integrated our P2P solutions onto a single platform in the quarter. P2P comparable transaction growth was 123% and 124% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Although we are seeing a strong demand by financial institutions to add P2P, there have been delays in the FI implementation queues and their timeline for installation which is impacting revenues. To-date, P2P has yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth.
Operating income for the quarter was $160 million in the Payments segment compared with $164 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date operating income was $321 million compared to $320 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 29.8% in the second quarter down from 31.7% in the comparable quarter and up 30 basis points sequentially.
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating margin for the segment was down 140 basis points. Operating margin was compressed in the quarter due to the timing of license and services revenue, implementation cost, expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact from Bill payment deconversions. These items had a combined negative impact of more than 200 basis points segment margin in the quarter. Revenue in the Financial segment increased 1% to $502 million in the quarter compared with the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated to 3% compared with 2% in the first 6 months of 2011. We are pleased with the increase in recurring revenue and higher growth rate in the segment, driven by our account processing and lending businesses. The timing of license and termination fee revenue negatively impacted second quarter growth rate by approximately 140 basis points, while positively impacting the first quarter growth rate by about the same percentage. Year-to-date, the combined license and termination fee revenue in this segment is roughly flat to the prior-year period. We anticipate a stronger second half of the year for license revenue based on our historical performance and current pipeline. Volume reductions in our item processing business have impacted revenue growth both in the quarter and year-to-date by approximately 1 percentage point.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 7% in the quarter to $163 million. And operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to 32.5%. This performance is exceptional given the drag on margin in the quarter from a decrease in higher-margin license and termination fee revenue. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was up 8% to $314 million and operating margin increased 140 basis points to 31.3% compared with the prior year. Each of the major businesses within the Financial segment contributed to the margin expansion, demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our business model.
Continued progress in our operational effectiveness initiatives also had a positive impact on margin in the quarter. The operating loss in the Corporate segment for the second quarter was $21 million, and increased by $5 million over the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the timing of marketing expenses, including expenses related to our client conference held in the second quarter. As you know, we have been keenly focused on reducing our tax rate, which has gone from over 38% a few years ago to an effective tax rate for the first 6 months, which is substantially lower. As we mentioned, the adjusted results in the quarter excludes certain positive discrete tax benefits related to prior years totaling $14 million or $0.10 per share. This adjustment results in effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 36%, which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual effective tax rate going forward.
We anticipate our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 37%, which does not include any potential benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit. Net interest expense has declined $12 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily associated with lower overall interest rates. In addition, year-to-date investment income was $6 million in 2012 and 2011. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2012 was $298 million, a decrease of $37 million from the prior year, which is primarily due to higher tax and incentive payment accruals paid in the first half of 2012. Free cash flow in the second quarter was back on track, increasing by 26% compared with the prior-year quarter as we benefit from earnings growth and reversal of some unfavorable shifts in working capital experienced in recent quarters. Total debt at June 30 was $3.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to finalize a new revolving credit facility in the near term, which will likely increase our revolver capacity from $1 billion to as much as $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2017.
We expect to reduce our ongoing interest cost and spread compared to our current facility. We intend to pay off our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November using a combination of financing sources, which may include utilizing a portion of the new revolving credit facility. We only had $20 million drawn on the facility at the end of June. We repurchased 2.1 million of shares of stock in the quarter for $143 million and year-to-date, we have repurchased the 5.8 million shares for $388 million. As of June 30, there are approximately 9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Sales in the quarter was strong, with quota attainment of 117%, 22% ahead of last year's second quarter, which was a record level of that time. Through the first half of 2012, on a straight-line basis, we read 19% quota attainment. Our qualified pipeline, which includes a wide range of solutions across all sized institutions is well above where it was a year ago. We are on track to meet our annual sales target. Integrated sales also improved in the quarter, increasing 38% sequentially to $44 million through payments and channel solutions again, experiencing the highest demand. Through the first half of the year, integrated sales were $76 million, or roughly 38% of our annual target. Similar to the last 4 years, we expect stronger integrated sales in the second half of the year and believe we are on track to achieve our annual objective of $200 million.
We achieved $14 million in cost savings in the quarter and $27 million in the first 6 months of the year, 68% of our annual target. We're well positioned to meet our operational effectiveness objectives for the full year. Before I update you on guidance, I will comment briefly on the environment. Regulatory actions have continued to decline in both frequency and asset size. There have been 46 regulatory actions through July 27 compared to 77 actions during the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down by about 2/3 to just under $10 billion. In a repeat of last summer, the Eurozone crisis is once again front and center in the business headlines. Although this volatility is part of our client discussions, it has not had a direct impact in our business. Less than 2% of our revenue comes from Europe, and the majority of our European revenue is based in countries least impacted by the crisis. We are also seeing advice to consider the impact of increasing pressure in Asia as that part of the world gravels with the implications of slowing growth. The market environment for financial institutions in the U.S. remains generally stable, with regulatory and economic pressures presenting growth and profitability challenges, which we believe are likely to persist. Our market conversations are centered on a variety of technology solutions that build in support revenue, enhance customer loyalty across all channels and bridge efficiency. These themes are evidenced in our product prioritization, sales results and are well represented in our pipeline.
Turning to guidance, we continue to expect stronger second half of the year and more specifically, we believe absolute performance for peak at year-end as we had seen over the last several years. We anticipate adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% for the year. Given our strong EPS performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing the bottom end of our expected EPS guidance range $0.04 and now expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year compared to $4.58 in 2011. Given the timing of certain sales wins, and the impact of a few of our larger implications, we now expect adjusted operating margin for 2012 to increase in a range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year versus 2011. We continue to expect free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.70 for the year.
We've made strong strategic progress and remained bullish in our growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Our business model continues to generate consistent financial results and recurring revenue from our new solutions is beginning to come online. Based on the combination of our current results, macro trends, which is support our product strategy and the richness of our sales pipeline, we have solid momentum going into 2013. Of course, none of this will be possible without the incredible commitment of our more than 20,000 associates around world, which provided me even greater confidence in your companies future. With that, Angie, let's open the line for questions."

Of course, last year's fourth quarter was quite strong, and even though we think absolute performance will peak in the fourth quarter, given last year's third quarter, it's all together feasible that the percentage increase in revenue growth itself on an organic basis will be stronger in Q3 and in Q4. But there's a lot in the sales pipeline as I mentioned. And to some degree, it's hard to predict when some of these transactions will come in or not. And so there's a little bit of lumpiness to that, that and some of the points Tom was talking about this in terms of when some of these larger implementations come online.

The network is looking actually very good, certainly given some of the -- some of what's going on out there, so we feel quite good about that. And I would say that we've made a little bit of a conscious decision within CashEdge to focus more energy on technical and product integration, and that was really on the basis that we saw some delays earlier in the year where the market was really waiting for us to communicate what we were going to do and then integrate against that plant. And so we've done that as we mentioned we went live in the second quarter, so we now have a single Popmoney network out there. However, the implication to that has been really that sales were a little bit slower than we thought. And then after we sell it, it obviously, has to move into the implementation queues of the client. So I think, we suspect that we will see the CashEdge revenue being a little bit lower this year than we'd originally anticipated. But in fact, the sales momentum and therefore, the revenue momentum we see going into next year will likely be higher than we would have seen otherwise."

So we did -- when we announced earnings in the first quarter, we indicated that even though the numbers were little bit lighter than people, we're probably anticipating even though we had a record Q4 of '11, that we felt we were on track and I think our second quarter results showed that. Clearly, the TD Bank deal, it was closed in the quarter and that is included in our numbers. And so a deal of that stature is certainly helpful and with that deal has been processed for quite a while. And in fact, it closed a little bit later than we actually originally anticipated. So that was in our number, but we also commented on the fact that our pipeline even with the strong quarter we had is actually well above where it was at the same time last year. So even though the environment is, kind of remains a little bit muted, the solutions that we have been developing and the products that we have been delivering into the market are not at all muted. And in fact, the TD deal itself is really I think a testament to the need for institutions to deliver kind of the best possible digital experience, which encompasses both online and mobile. And if you have a great mobile solution but you don't have a wonderful bill payment solution, you're not going to be delivering the most value and the same thing applies to products such as P2P, products like online account opening, account transfer, Risk & Fraud, all of that, like that market is moving very, very quickly. And in fact, to the point that Thomas was talking about in his section around the chance formation deal, one of the challenges that you have of those deals is the market is moving so fast, people are changing their minds and adding requirements and features and functions, which is good news but it is having an impact on those transactions -- on the completion of those transactions. But the bottom line is, is in those areas, Glenn, where we have been investing, we really have very good macros behind that as well as those products are surrounding even our core processing solutions, and we're seeing good momentum in that space as well."

So from that perspective, we feel like that -- the CashEdge acquisition will be on track. The network right, because of the integration that we're going to have with P2P and some other uses of real-time, including looking at it for options around expedited bill payment, we see our network business continuing to grow. We actually have both year-over-year and sequential quarterly growth in our network business, so that business continues to work well for us. So, and Acumen, you heard us say we're live in our first material you as client. So from a perspective of getting up to that bridge, we still feel very good about that and probably the thing that is a little bit better right now than we had were aware of when we were talking at Analyst Day last year is the bill payment mentum that we are seeing. And now what would standing the discussion to Tom had on what happened this quarter, that TD deal some other transactions in our pipeline, the energy from automobile in terms of bill pay and get in that integration, we are really see be seeing new kinds of bill pay users come on and we believe as mobile scales and the integration skills the that will help drive other growth in our existing businesses.

So on the Online Banking side, we have a fairly high degree of penetration overall in terms of number of online users across our system and certainly much of that is just first across a combination of community institutions and larger institutions. There are a lot of -- there's lots of room for us to grow in the online space in terms of helping folks redesign the experience. I would say that while that is a big -- it's a good opportunity I think the bigger opportunity is really at right now on mobile. That is really more beginning much more focused within the institutions than online. They're both important, but I think people say, what I have limited dollars at this stage, I'm going to buy us more to the mobile side of the house. And again, as we talked about before, Chris, we think of mobile and online as being to some extent highway and then we have to bring as much content as we can deliver as much content as we can across that highway. So when you think about bill pay, for example, I don't have the numbers in front of me but I think we, today, we handle 18 -- around 18 of the top 25 institutions on our bill pay technology, TD Bank was, obviously, one that we did not have. There are not a lot of TD Banks. TD is a big top 10 banks. So there are not very many of folks available. But what that shows is for those people who are not using our technology, given the level of savvy right, this kind of digital savvy that exist in the minds of consumers and level of empowerment, we're having more and more conversations. I think Tom was fairly explicit that the bill pay pipeline looks quite strong, well it looks quite strong because people are really saying we're at a little bit of a jumping off point where we need to decide how we're going to manage this channel moving forward. So a bit of a long winded answer, there are not lots and lots of those available. But 1 or 2 of these deals make a big difference in terms of number one, making sure that we're exposing as many consumers as we can to the technology and number two, keeping in mind that even though we have a very high penetration at the bank level itself, the underlying consumer adoption is still quite low. But the average adoption within a bank is still less than 20% of the DDAs. So we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing even new bill payment users on into the banks where we currently have a position."

And we really think P2P is a complete game-changer when it's real time. Right? So the ability to move money real-time to anyone in the United States who has a bank account really is a different deal. And so that really is the inflection point that I was talking about. On the mobile side, well, I wouldn't say it's an inflection point. We're quite pleased with what we are seeing that transactions are actually higher. Adoption is going better than we thought, and Tom I think in his comments alluded to the fact that we still even have 3 -- over 300 clients who have signed for mobile that aren't live yet. So we have a good pipeline not just of new prospects but turning people live. And so that is not quite at a tipping point yet, but we would expect by the end of this year to have an awful lot of momentum on the mobile side."

Two things that are going on in E bill probably important. We actually have been running some test on the e-bill side to understand different ways to improve the customer experience. One of the challenges with e- bill is as I'm sure you know, in order to get the data in E bill is you have to be able to provide credentials and other things that allow us to work with the biller and supply that directly in and that process has been a little clunky over the years. We've actually been working for the last year or so on improving that experience and we've just begun to move that into production in the second quarter. And we're actually seeing some pretty good results. So that will be moved in throughout the system this year and we believe we'll start to see some benefit there and certainly into '13. The other thing that's going on is for people who've known the company for a long time, we have a site called my CheckFree where we supply E-bills basically to allow people to pay single bills for clients who have not traditionally had biller direct site. And that's really a legacy technology and over the years, that whose bills have been diminishing, and why you can't see because we net the numbers out is E-bill is actually growing on databases materially higher than you see because of the decline coming out of the public site is much larger. And so we care, obviously, a lot more about the coupled E bill, bill payment experience but we would do reported on a net basis. And perhaps at Investor Day will break that out. So people can understand how E bill is actually growing."

Sorry, slower in Q2 for clarity than they were in Q1, and that house the compressing effect on our growth rate. The other thing though is there was some kind of anomaly in the quarter, we did some pretty deep analysis on this, which wouldn't surprise you, I'm sure. And virtually every category of the client, reseller, small community institution, large client had lower growth in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And to me, that translates to probably a different mix of days in the quarter not the number of processing days because that we know, but a different mix of days. People pay bills differently on different days. We get those anomalies every year. It just so happened that all of these things conspired together in Q2 to give that number to be where it is. We feel -- we continue to feel good about where we are, I believe that, that number will go back up to where it was and obviously, with the announcement today we had a couple of large bill pay deals that we announced last year, of which at least one of them I can think off of the top of my head is going live at the end of the third quarter, so those numbers will come back up."

So fair amount of energy around analytics. And -- but on the fee side, you really have areas like P2P where many banks are charging for P2P and seeing reasonably good take-ups. At Investor Day we're talk a bunch about how we're seeing the pricing moving in that space and how we believe banks are going to be able to actually create a very attractive stream of revenue, especially as real-time goes live on the fee side. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such strong success in terms of banks wanting to have that capability relationship advances and other way that banks can serve a different kind of consumer that they typically wouldn't serve in a far more cost-effective way than that group of consumers would be able to get outside the network, seeing a lot of -- still a lot of energy on -- are there opportunities on prepaids, so just a lot of those different ways to increase revenue slowly. I mean there's no silver bullet out there. It's really a combination of different factors, so products and intelligence. And then really looking for ways to use the channel as a way to really reduce their operating costs and other ways to create efficiency."

So for years, there was always compression in these larger agreements. And I think that is typically been the norm.

And we have said very publicly that there are certain clients, right, that want things from us that, price we don't think makes sense and therefore, we won't price it at certain levels. We believe that bill payment used right in terms of creating loyalty, creating retention, creating the use of the data and frankly, the most fully featured best fraud-protected product in the market, we think speaks for itself, in fact, we believe that's why TD chose that. But it doesn't mean there isn't price out there that we deal with and we do. But our goal is to create more differentiation in the product, especially when it becomes paired up with P2P. We think that is one of the more important underlying connection points within the quote network of money movement, bill pay and P2P complement each other very well. They're not cannibalizing, they're complementary. So -- and again, we have the leading bank centric online bill payment system, as well as the online P2P system. So we think we're well-positioned in that arena.

Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the quarter and 4% t",1163,"Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We again, generated strong earnings growth in the quarter, with adjusted EPS increasing 13% to $1.28, and is up 15% to $2.48 for the first half of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the quarter and 4% through June 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and is 2% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was 29.3% in the quarter consistent with the prior year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 29% year-to-date, led by very strong performance in the Financial segment. Free cash flow increased 26% in the quarter to $115 million, compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow is down 11% to $298 million, primarily related to higher tax payments.
Strong sales in the quarter, led to the second highest results in the company's history, only the fourth quarter of 2011 was higher. On balance, we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year, which are in line with our expectations. We continue to expect and are on track for stronger second half results which should lead to another year of solid growth and financial performance.
That said, we do recognize that there is more variability in our results this quarter than is typical, which merits further explanation. There are 3 areas, 2 of which are generally timing-related, which impacted our second quarter results. First, the timing of license and termination fees pressured our second quarter growth rate by just over 1%. A swing from the first quarter's results, which had been positively impacted by just under 1%. And although these types of revenue are less than 5% of the company total, on the margin, a few million dollars can move the growth rate in a quarter. Second, we were impacted by several large intricate client implementations, primarily in our online channel business where significant increases in scope and project duration shifted the timing of revenue from this period to out over the next several quarters.
The last is the impact of several unusual bill payment deconversions, primarily Wachovia, which we have discussed for a couple of quarters within the Payments segment. These impacts were largely anniversaried by the end of the third quarter. The cumulative impact of these items on the company's internal revenue growth rate in the quarter is approximately 2.5 percentage points and approximately 1 percentage point for the year-to-date. The majority of the impact is in the Payments segment. These items are also compressing margin commensurately. Tom will provide more color in his discussion of our financial results. 
As we shared at the beginning of the year, we are focused on 3 key enterprise priorities in 2012, which more fully represent our formula to create sustainable shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality earnings growth and meet our revenue commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhance our results for our clients.
Revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was driven by steady increases in recurring revenue across a number of our traditional businesses including debit, account processing and lending. The operating leverage in these recurring revenue businesses, combined with the continued progress of our operational effectiveness initiatives resulted in 4% growth in adjusted operating income and 20 basis points in margin expansion in the first half of the year, despite the second quarter impacts I just discussed. Adjusted EPS through June 30 has increased 15%, and we're on track to extend our streak of 26 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our focus on enhancing our growth culture led to strong sales performance in the quarter. As you know, we announced the deal today with TD Bank, which is the largest electronic bill payment win in our history outside of the Bank of America transaction in 2000. This competitive takeaway highlights the product advantages and network scale that will allow TD to provide world-class bill payment and e-bill services to their customers as part of a differentiated online experience. 
Increasingly, the largest financial institutions in the U.S. are turning to Fiserv for an integrated suite of our leading channel and payment solutions to help them harness the power of the digital movement. Speaking of which, we're making great progress adding scale to our new solutions such as P2P, where we have now signed 14 of the top 30 banks in the U.S. and total of over 1,600 institutions. Our P2P sales pipeline with leading banks and credit unions continues to be very strong. We signed over 400 bill payment debit P2P and mobile banking clients in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our market-leading account processing client base. We now have over 1,100 clients signed for Mobiliti, with over 750 live as of June 30. As users and transactions accelerate, this should have an even larger positive effect on our revenue growth rate. 
We had a great quarter against our priority of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for clients. In June, we successfully combined our 2 P2P products, creating a single integrated solution and network under the Popmoney brand, along with enhanced functionality and multiple payment options. In addition, Popmoney is now integrated and available within the CheckFree RXP payment suite and use it more than 3,800 financial institutions. 
Within the currently signed Popmoney network, we have the potential to access more than 40 million online and mobile banking relationships across those 1,600 institutions. There is continuing optimism around the financial industry's desire to drive value to consumers and small businesses through a well-featured P2P solution and scaled network. We have dedicated significant resources to this integration and are pleased with its success.
We also launched our ASP version of Relationship Advance at a regional bank in the quarter. As you may recall from last year's investor conference, Relationship Advance is a deposit-based lending technology solution that enables financial institutions to offer their customers small dollar loans through Online Banking, at a much lower cost than would be available in traditional channels. The ASP-based system streamlines the process, provides immediate customer approval and funding, and offers flexible pricing and repayment alternatives.
Lastly, Trustone Financial Federal Credit Union went live on Acumen, our next-generation credit union account-processing solution in early July. Their new integrated core account system includes a suite of channel and payment solutions, reaching it's more than 60,000 members such as Corillian Online, Mobiliti, Popmoney and CheckFree RXP. The success of the Trustone conversion, especially given the complex integration of about 30 internal and external solutions, is a significant milestone for Acumen in the U.S. market. With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom who will provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion, an increase 4% in the first 6 months of 2012, to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date",1425,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion, an increase 4% in the first 6 months of 2012, to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date. As Jeff highlighted earlier, there were timing impacts in the second quarter, with license and termination fees, revenue related to large customer implementations and also lower bill payment revenue, primarily attributable to the Wachovia deconversion. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.28 in the quarter and has increased 15% to $2.48 through June 30. The Q2 earnings per share results exclude a positive discrete tax benefit of $0.10 per share that was recognized for GAAP purposes. This adjustment results in a full year rate, which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual adjusted effective tax rate.
Adjusted operating income was $302 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 29.3%, consistent with the second quarter of 2011, and up 60 basis points sequentially, which is compelling considering the 80 basis point negative impact in the quarter related to the decline in license and termination fee revenue. For the first 6 months, adjusted operating income increased 4% to $598 million and adjusted operating margin improved by 20 basis points to 29% compared with the prior year period. 
Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $538 million in the quarter and increased 5% to $1.1 billion in the first 6 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and 2% through June 30. Card services and output solutions continued to drive revenue growth, both in the quarter and year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by a reduction in bill payment revenue attributable to the deconversion of Wachovia, a core competitor that formerly resold CheckFree and 2 remittance-only clients, which negatively impacted revenue growth in this segment by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of the bill payment clients I just mentioned, bill payment transactions increased 3% in the quarter and were up 5% year-to-date. At this point, the substantial majority of the comparable bill payment rollover is behind us. The combination of our recent large CheckFree RXP wins and a strong pipeline of new deals should boost the revenue growth rate nicely in this business.
Also, the timing of software license revenue, large services implementations and Durbin implications in our biller business, negatively impacted year-over-year segment revenue growth by approximately 160 basis points. This, combined with the bill payment deconversions, had a combined impact of more than 3 percentage points on the Payments segment growth rate in the quarter. The other transaction growth of 16% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date was a result of better than market transaction growth, as well as the onboarding of new clients. We added 93 new debit clients over the first 6 months of the year, roughly on par with last year's level. Renewal activity has remained strong, car growth has continued, and volume growth kicked up in July compared with the second quarter. 
As Jeff mentioned, we successfully integrated our P2P solutions onto a single platform in the quarter. P2P comparable transaction growth was 123% and 124% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Although we are seeing a strong demand by financial institutions to add P2P, there have been delays in the FI implementation queues and their time line for installation which is impacting revenue. To-date, P2P has yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth.
Operating income for the quarter was $160 million in the Payments segment compared with $164 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date operating income was $321 million compared to $320 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 29.8% in the second quarter, down from 31.7% in the comparable quarter and up 30 basis points sequentially.
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating margin for the segment was down 140 basis points. Operating margin was compressed in the quarter due to the timing of license and services revenue, implementation cost, expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact from bill payment deconversions. These items had a combined negative impact of more than 200 basis points on segment margin in the quarter. 
Revenue in the Financial segment increased 1% to $502 million in the quarter compared with the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated to 3% compared with 2% in the first 6 months of 2011. We are pleased with the increase in recurring revenue and higher growth rate in the segment, driven by our account processing and lending businesses. The timing of license and termination fee revenue negatively impacted the second quarter growth rate by approximately 140 basis points, while positively impacting the first quarter growth rate by about the same percentage. Year-to-date, the combined license and termination fee revenue in this segment is roughly flat to the prior year period. We anticipate a stronger second half of the year for license revenue based on our historical performance and current pipeline. Volume reductions in our item processing business have impacted revenue growth both in the quarter and year-to-date by approximately 1 percentage point.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 7% in the quarter to $163 million. And operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to 32.5%. This performance is exceptional given the drag on margin in the quarter from a decrease in higher-margin license and termination fee revenue. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was up 8% to $314 million, and operating margin increased 140 basis points to 31.3% compared with the prior year. Each of the major businesses within the Financial segment contributed to the margin expansion, demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our business model.
Continued progress in our operational effectiveness initiatives also had a positive impact on margin in the quarter. The operating loss in the corporate segment for the second quarter was $21 million, and increased by $5 million over the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the timing of marketing expenses, including expenses related to our client conference held in the second quarter. As you know, we have been keenly focused on reducing our tax rate, which has gone from over 38% a few years ago to an effective tax rate for the first 6 months, which is substantially lower. As we mentioned, the adjusted results in the quarter exclude certain positive discrete tax benefits related to prior years totaling $40 million or $0.10 per share. This adjustment results in effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 36%, which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual effective tax rate going forward. We anticipate our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 37%, which does not include any potential benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Net interest expense has declined $12 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily associated with lower overall interest rates. In addition, year-to-date investment income was $6 million in 2012 and 2011. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2012 was $298 million, a decrease of $37 million from the prior year, which is primarily due to higher tax and incentive payment accruals paid in the first half of 2012. Free cash flow in the second quarter was back on track, increasing by 26% compared with the prior-year quarter as we benefit from earnings growth and the reversal of some unfavorable shifts in working capital experienced in recent quarters. 
Total debt at June 30 was $3.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to finalize a new revolving credit facility in the near term, which will likely increase our revolver capacity from $1 billion to as much as $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2017.
We expect to reduce our ongoing interest cost and spread compared to our current facility. We intend to pay off our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November using a combination of financing sources, which may include utilizing a portion of the new revolving credit facility. We only had $20 million drawn on the facility at the end of June. We repurchased 2.1 million of shares of stock in the quarter for $143 million and year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.8 million shares for $388 million. As of June 30, there are approximately 9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Through the first half of 2012, on a straight-line basis, we're at 90% quota attainment. Our qualified pipeline, which includes a wide range of solutions across all sized institutions is well above where it was a year ago. We are on track to meet our annual sales target. Integrated sales also improved in the quarter, increasing 38% sequentially to $44 million with payments and channel solutions again experiencing the highest demand. Through the first half of the year, integrated sales were $76 million or roughly 38% of our annual target. Similar to the last 4 years, we expect stronger integrated sales in the second half of the year, and believe we are on track to achieve our annual objective of $200 million.
We achieved $14 million in cost savings in the quarter and $27 million in the first 6 months of the year, 68% of our annual target. We're well positioned to meet our operational effectiveness objective for the full year. 
Before I update you on guidance, I will comment briefly on the environment. Regulatory actions have continued to decline in both frequency and asset size. There have been 46 regulatory actions through July 27 compared to 77 actions during the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down by about 2/3 to just under $10 billion. In a repeat of last summer, the Eurozone crisis is once again front and center in the business headlines. Although this volatility is part of our client discussions, it has not had a direct impact on our business. Less than 2% of our revenue comes from Europe, and the majority of our European revenue is based in countries least impacted by the crisis. We are also seeing FIs consider the impact of increasing pressure in Asia as that part of the world grapples with the implications of slowing growth. The market environment for financial institutions in the U.S. remains generally stable, with regulatory and economic pressures presenting growth and profitability challenges, which we believe are likely to persist. Our market conversations are centered on a variety of technology solutions that build in support revenue, enhance customer loyalty across all channels and bridge efficiency. These themes are evident in our product prioritization, sales results and are well represented in our pipeline.
Turning to guidance, we continue to expect stronger second half of the year and more specifically, we believe absolute performance will peak at year-end as we had seen over the last several years. We anticipate adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% for the year. Given our strong EPS performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing the bottom end of our expected EPS guidance range $0.04 and now expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year compared to $4.58 in 2011. 
Given the timing of certain sales wins, and the impact of a few of our larger implementations, we now expect adjusted operating margin for 2012 to increase in a range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year versus 2011. We continue to expect free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.70 for the year.
We've made strong strategic progress and remain bullish on our growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Our business model continues to generate consistent financial results, and recurring revenue from our new solutions is beginning to come online. Based on the combination of our current results, macro trends, which support our product strategy, and the richness of our sales pipeline, we have solid momentum going into 2013. Of course, none of this will be possible without the incredible commitment of our more than 20,000 associates around world, which provide me even greater confidence in your company's future. With that, Angie, let's open the line for questions."

Of course, last year's fourth quarter was quite strong, and even though we think absolute performance will peak in the fourth quarter, given last year's third quarter, it's all together feasible that the percentage increase in revenue growth itself on an organic basis will be stronger in Q3 and in Q4. But there's a lot in the sales pipeline as I mentioned. And to some degree, it's hard to predict when some of these transactions will come in or not. And so there's a little bit of lumpiness to that, that and some of the points Tom was talking about, just in terms of when some of these larger implementations come online.

And so we've done that, as we mentioned, we went live in the second quarter, so we're -- we now have a single Popmoney network out there. However, the implication to that has been really that sales were a little bit slower than we thought. And then after we sell it, it obviously, has to move into the implementation queues of the client. So I think, I suspect that we will see the CashEdge revenue being a little bit lower this year than we originally anticipated.

So we did -- when we announced earnings in the first quarter, we indicated that even though the numbers were little bit lighter than people, were probably anticipating even though we had a record Q4 of '11, that we felt we were on track and I think our second quarter results show that. Clearly, the TD Bank deal, is -- it was closed in the quarter and that is included in our numbers. And so a deal of that stature is certainly helpful and with that deal has been processed for quite a while. And in fact, it was -- it closed a little bit later than we actually originally anticipated. So that was in our number, but we also commented on the fact that our pipeline, even with the strong quarter we had, is actually well above where it was at the same time last year. So even though the environment is kind of remains a little bit muted, the solutions that we have been developing and the products that we have been delivering into the market are not at all muted. And in fact, the TD deal itself is really, I think, a testament to the need to -- for institutions to deliver kind of the best possible digital experience, which encompasses both online and mobile. And if you have a great mobile solution but you don't have a wonderful bill payment solution, you're not going to be delivering the most value. And the same thing applies to products such as P2P, products like online account opening, account transfer, risk, fraud, all of that. Right, that market is moving very, very quickly. And in fact, to the point that Tom was talking about in his section around the  online transformational deals, one of the challenges that you have in those deals is the market is moving so fast, people are changing their minds and adding requirements and features and functions, which is good news but it is having an impact on those -- on the completion of those transactions. But the bottom line is, is in those areas, Glenn, where we have been investing, we really have very good macros behind that, as well as those products are surrounding even our core processing solutions, and we're seeing good momentum in that space as well."

So we would expect a little bit more of leads in the next couple of years, in '13 and '14, and then have it fall back into a more normal growth rate as you would see in the larger institution.

We've -- we actually have both year-over-year and sequential quarterly growth in our network business, so that business continues to work well for us. So, and Acumen, you heard us say we're live with our first material U.S. client. So from a perspective of getting up to that bridge, we still feel very good about that and probably, the thing that is a little bit better right now than we had -- that we were aware of when we were talking at Analyst Day last year is the bill pay momentum that we are seeing. Again, notwithstanding the discussion that Tom had on what happened this quarter, the TD deal, some other transactions in our pipeline, the energy from automobile in terms of bill pay and getting that integration, we're really seeing -- we're seeing new kinds of bill pay users come on and we believe as mobile scales and the integration scales, that, that will help drive other growth in our existing businesses. So on balance, we probably have more conviction as we sit here today than we did a year ago in terms -- or 9 months ago in terms of driving that 4% to 8%."

So on the Online Banking side, we have a fairly high degree of penetration overall in terms of number of online users across our system and certainly much of that is just dispersed across a combination of community institutions and larger institutions. There are a lot of -- there's lots of room for us to grow in the online space in terms of helping folks redesign the experience. I would say that while that is a big -- it's a good opportunity I think the bigger opportunity is really right now on mobile. That is really more -- beginning much more focused within the institutions than online. They're both important, but I think people say, ""Well, I have limited dollars. At this stage, I'm going to bias more to the mobile side of the house."" And again, as we've talked about before, Chris, we think of mobile and online as being, to some extent, a highway and then we have to bring as much content as we can, deliver as much content as we can across that highway. So when you think about bill pay, for example, I don't have the numbers in front of me but I think we, today, we handle 18 -- around 18 of the top 25 institutions on our bill pay technology, TD Bank was obviously one that we did not have. There are not a lot of TD Banks. Right, TD is, I think, a top 10 bank. So there are not very many of folks available. But what that shows is for those people who are not using our technology, given the level of savvy, right, this kind of digital savvy that exist in the minds of consumers and the level of empowerment, we're having more and more conversations. I think Tom was fairly explicit that the bill pay pipeline looks quite strong. Well, it looks quite strong because, I think, people are really saying we're at a little bit of a jumping off point where we need to decide how we're going to manage this channel moving forward. So a bit of a long-winded answer, there are not lots and lots of those available. But 1 or 2 of these deals make a big difference in terms of, number one, making sure that we're exposing as many consumers as we can to the technology and number two, keeping in mind that even though we have a very high penetration at the bank level itself, the underlying consumer adoption is still quite low. Right, the average adoption within a bank is still less than 20% of the DDAs. So we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing even new bill payment users on into banks where we currently are -- have a position."

On the mobile side, while I wouldn't say it's an inflection point, we're quite pleased with what we are seeing transactions are actually higher, adoption is going better than we thought, and Tom, I think, in his comments alluded to the fact that we still even have 3 -- over 300 clients who have signed for mobile that aren't live yet. So we have a good pipeline, not just of new prospects, but turning people live. And so that is not quite at a tipping point yet, but we would expect by the end of this year to have an awful lot of momentum on the mobile side."

But 2 things that are going on in e-bill and probably important. We actually have been running some tests on the e-bill side to understand different ways to improve the customer experience. One of the challenges with e-bill is, as I'm sure you know, in order to get the data fed e-bill, you have to be able to provide credentials and other things that allow us to work with the biller and supply that directly in and that process has been a little clunky over the years. We've actually been working for the last year or so on improving that experience and we've just begun to move that into production in the second quarter. And we're actually seeing some pretty good results. So that will be moved in throughout the system this year, and we believe we'll start to see some benefit there and certainly into '13. The other thing that's going on is, for people who have known the company for a long time, we have a site called MyCheckFree where we supply e-bills basically to allow people to pay single bills for clients who have not traditionally had biller direct sites. And that's really a legacy technology, and over the years, that -- those bills have been diminishing, and what you can't see because we net the numbers out is e-bill is actually growing on data set basis materially higher than you see because the decline coming out of the public site is much larger. And so we care, obviously, a lot more about the coupled e-bill bill payment experience but we would do report it on a net basis. And perhaps at Investor Day we'll break that out so we can -- people can understand how e-bill is actually growing."

So we feel like we are on track on that front, and we will continue to build momentum in that area. That said, this is a brand-new core, right, that is -- Tom was talking about areas of complex implementations. This is -- given the architecture and the process flexibility that is inherent in this technology, it is a long and to some extent, arduous process in terms of working with the client to get what it is they want out of this new powerful technology. And in fact, it's likely given the -- how new the solution is, that it will still be a couple of years before we even have credit unions who understand enough about what the technology can do, that they're really getting the most out of it, which is not surprising. You would see that in any new technology. P2P is the same kind of thing on the consumer side. So it's -- it is doing what it should be doing at this stage."

But we didn't back out any of the items that Tom talked about earlier, including the certain core competitor that is no longer reselling CheckFree, the couple of remit-only clients. And I think we did announce at Investor Day last year that we had lost 2 RXP clients, kind of larger, kind of mid-tier RXP clients, last year. So we've not backed out any of those for purposes of calculation. That said, that was also the case in Q1 where we didn't -- where we're not at that level. And so from that perspective, what I spent my time diagnosing is really 2 things: our largest clients who maybe have a little bit of a disproportionate share of impact on the growth rate or slower in the quarter than they were in Q1 -- sorry, slower in Q2 for clarity than they were in Q1, and that house a compressing effect on our growth rate. The other thing, though, is there was some kind of anomaly in the quarter. We did some pretty deep analysis on this, which wouldn't surprise you, I'm sure. And virtually every category of client, reseller, small community institution, large client had lower growth in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And to me, that translates to, probably, a different mix of days in the quarter, not the number of processing days because that we know, but a different mix of days. People pay bills differently on different days. We get those anomalies every year. It just so happened that all of these things conspired together in Q2 to give that number to be where it is. We feel -- we continue to feel good about where we are, I have every belief that, that number will go back up to where it was and obviously, with the announcement today, we had a couple of large bill pay deals that we announced last year, of which at least one of them I can think off of the top of my head is going live at the end of the third quarter, so those numbers will come back up."

So a fair amount of energy around analytics. And -- but on the fee side, you really have areas like P2P where many banks are charging for P2P and seeing reasonably good take-ups. At Investor Day we're going to talk a bunch about how we're seeing the pricing moving in that space and how we believe banks are going to be able to actually create a very attractive stream of revenue, especially as real-time goes live on the fee side. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such strong success in terms of banks wanting to add that capability. Relationship Advance is another way that banks can serve a different kind of consumer that they typically wouldn't serve in a far more cost-effective way than that group of consumers would be able to get outside the network, seeing -- and seeing a lot of -- still a lot of energy on -- are there opportunities on prepaids, so just a lot of those different ways to increase revenue slowly.

And that -- and we have said very publicly that there are certain clients, right, that want things from us that -- for a price that we don't think makes sense, and therefore, we won't price it at certain levels. We believe that bill payment used right in terms of creating loyalty, creating retention, creating the use of the data and, frankly, the most fully featured best fraud-protected product in the market, we think speaks for itself, and frankly, we believe that's why TD chose that. But it doesn't mean there isn't price out there that we deal with and we do. But our goal is to create more differentiation in the product, especially when it becomes paired up with P2P. And we think that as one of the more important underlying connection points within the ""network of money movement."" Bill pay and P2P complement each other very well. They're not cannibalizing, they're complementary. So -- and again, we have the leading bank-centric online bill payment system, as well as the online P2P system.

We again generated strong earnings growth in the quarter, with adjusted EPS increasing 13% to $1.28 and is up 15% to $2.48 for the first half of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the quarter and 4% through June 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and is 2% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was 29.3% in the quarter, consistent with the prior year, and up 60 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 29% year-to-date, led by very strong performance in the Financial segment. Free cash flow increased 26% in the quarter to $115 million compared with the second quarter of 2011, driven by growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow is down 11% to $298 million, primarily related to higher tax payments.
Strong sales in the quarter led to the second-highest results in the company's history.  Only the fourth quarter of 2011 was higher. On balance, we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year, which are in line with our expectations. We continue to expect and are on track for stronger second half results, which should lead to another year of solid growth and financial performance.
That said, we do recognize that there is more variability in our results this quarter than is typical, which merits further explanation. There are 3 areas, 2 of which are generally timing-related, which impacted our second quarter results. First, the timing of license and termination fees pressured our second quarter growth rate by just over 1%. A swing from the first quarter's results, which had been positively impacted by just under 1%. And although these types of revenue are less than 5% of the company total, on the margin, a few million dollars can move the growth rate in a quarter. Second, we were impacted by several large intricate client implementations, primarily in our online channel business, where significant increases in scope and project duration shifted the timing of revenue from this period to out over the next several quarters.
The last is the impact of several unusual bill payment deconversions, primarily Wachovia, which we have discussed for a couple of quarters within the Payments segment. These impacts were largely anniversary-ed by the end of the third quarter. The cumulative impact of these items on the company's internal revenue growth rate in the quarter is approximately 2.5 percentage points and approximately 1 percentage point for the year-to-date. The majority of the impact is in the Payments segment. These items are also compressing margin commensurately. Tom will provide more color in his discussion of our financial results. 
As we shared at the beginning of the year, we are focused on 3 key enterprise priorities in 2012 which more fully represent our formula to create sustainable shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality earnings growth and meet our revenue commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients.
Revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was driven by steady increases in recurring revenue across a number of our traditional businesses, including debit, account processing and lending. The operating leverage in these recurring revenue businesses combined with the continued progress of our operational effectiveness initiatives resulted in 4% growth in adjusted operating income and 20 basis points in margin expansion in the first half of the year, despite the second quarter impacts I just discussed. Adjusted EPS through June 30 has increased 15%, and we're on track to extend our streak of 26 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our focus on enhancing our growth culture led to strong sales performance in the quarter. As you know, we announced a deal today with TD Bank, which is the largest electronic bill payment win in our history outside of the Bank of America transaction in 2000. This competitive takeaway highlights the product advantages and network scale that will allow TD to provide world-class bill payment and e-bill services to their customers as part of a differentiated online experience. 
Increasingly, the largest financial institutions in the U.S. are turning to Fiserv for an integrated suite of our leading channel and payment solutions to help them harness the power of the digital movement. Speaking of which, we're making great progress adding scale to our new solutions such as P2P, where we have now signed 14 of the top 30 banks in the U.S. and a total of over 1,600 institutions. Our P2P sales pipeline with leading banks and credit unions continues to be very strong. We signed over 400 bill payment debit P2P and mobile banking clients in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our market-leading account processing client base. We now have over 1,100 clients signed for Mobiliti, with over 750 live as of June 30. As users and transactions accelerate, this should have an even larger positive effect on our revenue growth rate. 
We had a great quarter against our priority of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for clients. In June, we successfully combined our 2 P2P products, creating a single integrated solution and network under the Popmoney brand, along with enhanced functionality and multiple payment options. In addition, Popmoney is now integrated and available within the CheckFree RXP payment suite and used at more than 3,800 financial institutions. 
Within the currently signed Popmoney network, we have the potential to access more than 40 million online and mobile banking relationships across those 1,600 institutions. There is continuing optimism around the financial industry's desire to drive value to consumers and small businesses through a well-featured P2P solution and scaled network. We have dedicated significant resources to this integration and are pleased with its success.
We also launched our ASP version of Relationship Advance at a regional bank in the quarter. As you may recall from last year's investor conference, Relationship Advance is a deposit-based lending technology solution that enables financial institutions to offer their customers small-dollar loans through Online Banking at a much lower cost than would be available in traditional channels. The ASP-based system streamlines the process, provides immediate customer approval and funding, and offers flexible pricing and repayment alternatives.
Lastly, TruStone Financial Federal Credit Union went live on Acumen, our next-generation credit union account-processing solution in early July. Their new integrated core account system includes a suite of channel and payment solutions reaching its more than 60,000 members, such as Corillian Online, Mobiliti, Popmoney and CheckFree RXP. The success of the TruStone conversion, especially given the complex integration of about 30 internal and external solutions, is a significant milestone for Acumen in the U.S. market. 
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion and increased 4% in the first 6 months of 2012 to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date",1415,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 3% in the second quarter to $1 billion and increased 4% in the first 6 months of 2012 to $2.1 billion. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date. As Jeff highlighted earlier, there were timing impacts in the second quarter, with license and termination fees, revenue related to large customer implementations and also lower bill payment revenue, primarily attributable to the Wachovia deconversion. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.28 in the quarter and has increased 15% to $2.48 through June 30. The Q2 earnings-per-share results exclude a positive discrete tax benefit of $0.10 per share that was recognized for GAAP purposes. This adjustment results in a full year rate which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual adjusted effective tax rate.
Adjusted operating income was $302 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 29.3%, consistent with the second quarter of 2011 and up 60 basis points sequentially, which is compelling, considering the 80-basis-point negative impact in the quarter related to the decline in license and termination fee revenue. For the first 6 months, adjusted operating income increased 4% to $598 million, and adjusted operating margin improved by 20 basis points to 29% compared with the prior-year period. 
Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $538 million in the quarter and increased 5% to $1.1 billion in the first 6 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and 2% through June 30. Card services and output solutions continued to drive revenue growth, both in the quarter and year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by a reduction in bill payment revenue attributable to the deconversion of Wachovia, a core competitor that formerly resold CheckFree, and 2 remittance-only clients, which negatively impacted revenue growth in this segment by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of the bill payment clients I just mentioned, bill payment transactions increased 3% in the quarter and were up 5% year-to-date. At this point, the substantial majority of the comparable bill payment grow-over is behind us. The combination of our recent large CheckFree RXP wins and a strong pipeline of new deals should boost the revenue growth rate nicely in this business.
Also, the timing of software license revenue, large services implementations and Durbin implications in our biller business negatively impacted year-over-year segment revenue growth by approximately 160 basis points. This combined with the bill payment deconversions had a combined impact of more than 3 percentage points on the Payments segment growth rate in the quarter. Debit transaction growth of 16% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date was a result of better-than-market transaction growth as well as the on-boarding of new clients. We added 93 new debit clients over the first 6 months of the year, roughly on par with last year's level. Renewal activity has remained strong, car growth has continued, and volume growth kicked up in July compared with the second quarter. 
As Jeff mentioned, we successfully integrated our P2P solutions onto a single platform in the quarter. P2P comparable transaction growth was 123% and 124% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Although we are seeing strong demand by financial institutions to add P2P, there have been delays in the FI implementation queues and their time line for installation which is impacting revenue. To-date, P2P has yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth.
Operating income for the quarter was $160 million in the Payments segment compared with $164 million in the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date operating income was $321 million compared to $320 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 29.8% in the second quarter, down from 31.7% in the comparable quarter and up 30 basis points sequentially.
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating margin for the segment was down 140 basis points. Operating margin was compressed in the quarter due to the timing of license and services revenue, implementation cost, expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact from bill payment deconversions. These items had a combined negative impact of more than 200 basis points on segment margin in the quarter. 
Revenue in the Financial segment increased 1% to $502 million in the quarter compared with the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted internal revenue growth accelerated to 3% compared with 2% in the first 6 months of 2011. We are pleased with the increase in recurring revenue and higher growth rate in the segment, driven by our account processing and lending businesses. The timing of license and termination fee revenue negatively impacted the second quarter growth rate by approximately 140 basis points while positively impacting the first quarter growth rate by about the same percentage. Year-to-date, the combined license and termination fee revenue in this segment is roughly flat to the prior-year period. We anticipate a stronger second half of the year for license revenue based on our historical performance and current pipeline. Volume reductions in our item processing business have impacted revenue growth, both in the quarter and year-to-date, by approximately 1 percentage point.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 7% in the quarter to $163 million. And operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to 32.5%. This performance is exceptional, given the drag on margin in the quarter from a decrease in higher-margin license and termination fee revenue. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was up 8% to $314 million, and operating margin increased 140 basis points to 31.3% compared with the prior year. Each of the major businesses within the Financial segment contributed to the margin expansion, demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our business model.
Continued progress in our operational effectiveness initiatives also had a positive impact on margin in the quarter. The operating loss in the corporate segment for the second quarter was $21 million and increased by $5 million over the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the timing of marketing expenses, including expenses related to our client conference, held in the second quarter. As you know, we have been keenly focused on reducing our tax rate, which has gone from over 38% a few years ago to an effective tax rate for the first 6 months which is substantially lower. As we mentioned, the adjusted results in the quarter exclude certain positive discrete tax benefits related to prior years totaling $14 million or $0.10 per share. This adjustment results in effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 36%, which we believe is more indicative of our expected annual effective tax rate going forward. We anticipate our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 37%, which does not include any potential benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit. 
Net interest expense has declined $12 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily associated with lower overall interest rates. In addition, year-to-date investment income was $6 million in 2012 and 2011. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2012 was $298 million, a decrease of $37 million from the prior year, which is primarily due to higher tax and incentive payment accruals paid in the first half of 2012. Free cash flow in the second quarter was back on track, increasing by 26% compared with the prior-year quarter, as we benefit from earnings growth and the reversal of some unfavorable shifts in working capital experienced in recent quarters. 
Total debt at June 30 was $3.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to finalize a new revolving credit facility in the near term, which will likely increase our revolver capacity from $1 billion to as much as $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2017.
We expect to reduce our ongoing interest cost and spread compared to our current facility. We intend to pay off our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November, using a combination of financing sources, which may include utilizing a portion of the new revolving credit facility. We only had $20 million drawn on the facility at the end of June. We repurchased 2.1 million of shares of stock in the quarter for $143 million, and year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.8 million shares for $388 million. As of June 30, there are approximately 9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Sales in the quarter were strong, with quota attainment of 117%, 22% ahead of last year's second quarter, which was a record level at that time.

Sales in the quarter were strong, with quota attainment of 117%, 22% ahead of last year's second quarter, which was a record level at that time. Through the first half of 2012, on a straight-line basis, we're at 90% quota attainment. Our qualified pipeline, which includes a wide range of solutions across all-sized institutions is well above where it was a year ago. We are on track to meet our annual sales target. Integrated sales also improved in the quarter, increasing 38% sequentially to $44 million, with Payments and channel solutions again experiencing the highest demand. Through the first half of the year, integrated sales were $76 million or roughly 38% of our annual target. Similar to the last 4 years, we expect stronger integrated sales in the second half of the year and believe we are on track to achieve our annual objective of $200 million.
We achieved $14 million in cost savings in the quarter and $27 million in the first 6 months of the year, 68% of our annual target. We're well positioned to meet our operational effectiveness objective for the full year. 
Before I update you on guidance, I will comment briefly on the environment. Regulatory actions have continued to decline in both frequency and asset size. There have been 46 regulatory actions through July 27 compared to 77 actions during the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down by about 2/3 to just under $10 billion. In a repeat of last summer, the Eurozone crisis is once again front and center in the business headlines. Although this volatility is part of our client discussions, it has not had a direct impact on our business. Less than 2% of our revenue comes from Europe, and the majority of our European revenue is based in countries least impacted by the crisis. We are also seeing FIs consider the impact of increasing pressure in Asia as that part of the world grapples with the implications of slowing growth. The market environment for financial institutions in the U.S. remains generally stable, with regulatory and economic pressures presenting growth and profitability challenges which we believe are likely to persist. Our market conversations are centered on a variety of technology solutions that build and support revenue, enhance customer loyalty across all channels and bridge efficiency. These themes are evident in our product prioritization, sales results, and are well represented in our pipeline.
Turning to guidance, we continue to expect stronger second half of the year, and more specifically, we believe absolute performance will peak at year end, as we have seen over the last several years. We anticipate adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% for the year. Given our strong EPS performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing the bottom end of our expected EPS guidance range $0.04 and now expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year compared to $4.58 in 2011. 
Given the timing of certain sales wins and the impact of a few of our larger implementations, we now expect adjusted operating margin for 2012 to increase in a range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year versus 2011. We continue to expect free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.70 for the year.
We've made strong strategic progress and remain bullish on our growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Our business model continues to generate consistent financial results, and recurring revenue from our new solutions is beginning to come online. Based on the combination of our current results, macro trends which support our product strategy, and the richness of our sales pipeline, we have solid momentum going into 2013. Of course, none of this would be possible without the incredible commitment of our more than 20,000 associates around the world, which provide me even greater confidence in your company's future. With that, Angie, let's open the line for questions."

Of course, last year's fourth quarter was quite strong, and even though we think absolute performance will peak in the fourth quarter, given last year's third quarter, it's altogether feasible that the percentage increase in revenue growth itself on an organic basis will be stronger in Q3 than Q4. But there's a lot in the sales pipeline, as I mentioned. And to some degree, it's hard to predict when some of these transactions will come in or not. And so there's a little bit of lumpiness to that, that and some of the points Tom was talking about, just in terms of when some of these larger implementations come online.

And so we've done that.  As we mentioned, we went live in the second quarter, so we're -- we now have a single Popmoney network out there. However, the implication to that has been, really, that sales were a little bit slower than we thought. And then after we sell it, it obviously has to move into the implementation queues of the client. So I think, I suspect that we will see the CashEdge revenue being a little bit lower this year than we originally anticipated. But in fact, the sales momentum and, therefore, the revenue momentum we see coming -- going into next year will likely be higher than we would have seen otherwise."

And if you have a great mobile solution but you don't have a wonderful bill payment solution, you're not going to be delivering the most value. And the same thing applies to products such as P2P, products like online account opening, account transfer, risk, fraud, all of that, right, that market is moving very, very quickly. And in fact, to the point that Tom was talking about in his section around these  online transformational deals, one of the challenges that you have in those deals is the market is moving so fast, people are changing their minds and adding requirements and features and functions, which is good news, but it is having an impact on those -- on the completion of those transactions.

But we do expect it to be live for most of 2013, but we also know that historically, when we migrate a competitive solution, because of the level of functionality that we have in areas such as e-bill, right, kind of that deep direct connect on the e-bill side, we typically see a much higher level of take than we've seen historically, and it takes anywhere from 6 to 9 months for consumers to understand what they have and to begin using it. So we have a pretty good track record on that. So we would expect a little bit more of leaps in the next couple of years, in '13 and '14, and then have it fall back into a more normal growth rate as you would see in the larger institution. And part of that will depend on how TD Bank ends up using this as a way to catalyze their online experience. But we believe that they're going to make this central to their online and their mobile strategy. They are currently an online client of ours, and we'll look forward to working with them on that and doing a little bit more, hopefully, on the mobile side as well. So we see this to be an important expansion point for the relationship overall."

So from that perspective, we feel like that -- the CashEdge acquisition will be on track. The network, right, because of the integration that we are going to have with P2P and some other uses of real-time, including looking at it for options around expedited bill payment, we see our network business continuing to grow. We've -- we actually have both year-over-year and sequential quarterly growth in our network business, so that business continues to work well for us. So, and Acumen, you heard us say we're live with our first material U.S. client. So from a perspective of getting up to that bridge, we still feel very good about that, and probably, the thing that is a little bit better right now than we had -- that we were aware of when we were talking at Analyst Day last year is the bill pay momentum that we are seeing. Again, notwithstanding the discussion that Tom had on what happened this quarter, the TD deal, some other transactions in our pipeline, the energy from mobile in terms of bill pay and getting that integration, we're really seeing -- we're seeing new kinds of bill pay users come on, and we believe as mobile scales and the integration scales, that, that will help drive other growth in our existing businesses. So on balance, we probably have more conviction as we sit here today than we did a year ago in terms -- or 9 months ago in terms of driving that 4% to 8%."

So on the Online Banking side, we have a fairly high degree of penetration overall in terms of number of online users across our system, and certainly much of that is dispersed across a combination of community institutions and larger institutions. There are a lot of -- there's lots of room for us to grow in the online space in terms of helping folks redesign the experience. I would say that while that is a big -- it's a good opportunity, I think the bigger opportunity is really right now in mobile. That is really more -- getting much more focus within the institutions than online. They're both important, but I think people say, ""Well, I have limited dollars. At this stage, I'm going to bias more to the mobile side of the house."" And again, as we've talked about before, Chris, we think of mobile and online as being, to some extent, a highway, and then we have to bring as much content as we can, deliver as much content as we can across that highway. So when you think about bill pay, for example, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think we, today, we handle 18 -- around 18 of the top 25 institutions on our bill pay technology.  TD Bank was obviously one that we did not have. There are not a lot of TD Banks, right, TD is, I think, a top 10 bank. So there are not very many of those folks available. But what that shows is for those people who are not using our technology, given the level of savvy, right, this kind of digital savvy that exists in the minds of consumers and the level of empowerment, we're having more and more conversations. I think Tom was fairly explicit that the bill pay pipeline looks quite strong. Well, it looks quite strong because, I think, people are really saying we're at a little bit of a jumping-off point where we need to decide how we're going to manage this channel moving forward. So a bit of a long-winded answer.  There are not lots and lots of those available. But 1 or 2 of these deals make a big difference in terms of, number one, making sure that we're exposing as many consumers as we can to the technology, and number two, keeping in mind that even though we have a very high penetration at the bank level itself, the underlying consumer adoption is still quite low, right, the average adoption within a bank is still less than 20% of the DDAs. So we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing even new bill payment users on into banks where we currently are -- have a position."

Transactions are actually higher, adoption is going better than we thought, and Tom, I think, in his comments alluded to the fact that we still even have 3 -- over 300 clients who have signed for mobile that aren't live yet.

But 2 things that are going on in e-bill,  they're probably important. We actually have been running some tests on the e-bill side to understand different ways to improve the customer experience. One of the challenges with e-bill is, as I'm sure you know, in order to get the data fed e-bill, you have to be able to provide credentials and other things that allow us to work with the biller and supply that directly in, and that process has been a little clunky over the years. We've actually been working for the last year or so on improving that experience, and we've just begun to move that into production in the second quarter. And we're actually seeing some pretty good results. So that will be moved in throughout the system this year, and we believe we'll start to see some benefit there and certainly into '13. The other thing that's going on is, for people who have known the company for a long time, we have a site called MyCheckFree, where we supply e-bills basically to allow people to pay single bills for clients who have not traditionally had biller-direct sites. And that's really a legacy technology, and over the years, that -- -- those bills have been diminishing, and what you can't see, because we net the numbers out, is e-bill is actually growing on a data-set basis materially higher than you see because the decline coming out of the public site is much larger. And so we care, obviously, a lot more about the coupled e-bill-bill payment experience, but we would do report it on a net basis. And perhaps at Investor Day, we'll break that out so we can -- people can understand how e-bill is actually growing."

But we didn't back out any of the items that Tom talked about earlier, including the certain core competitor that is no longer reselling CheckFree, the couple of remit-only clients. And I think we did announce at Investor Day last year that we had lost 2 RXP clients, kind of larger, kind of mid-tier RXP clients last year. So we've not backed out any of those for purposes of the calculation. That said, that was also the case in Q1 where we didn't -- we're not at that level. And so from that perspective, where I spent my time diagnosing it, it's really 2 things: our largest clients, who maybe have a little bit of a disproportionate share of impact on the growth rate, were slower in the quarter than they were in Q1 -- sorry, slower in Q2, for clarity, than they were in Q1.  And that has a compressing effect on our growth rate. The other thing, though, is there was some kind of anomaly in the quarter. We did some pretty deep analysis on this, which wouldn't surprise you, I'm sure. And virtually every category of client, reseller, small community institution, large client, had lower growth in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And to me, that translates to, probably, a different mix of days in the quarter.  Not the number of processing days, because that we know, but a different mix of days. People pay bills differently on different days. We get those anomalies every year. It just so happened that all of these things conspired together in Q2 to get that number to be where it is. We feel -- we continue to feel good about where we are.  I have every belief that, that number will go back up to where it was, and obviously, with the announcement today, we had a couple of large bill-pay deals that we announced last year, of which at least one of them I can think off of the top of my head is going live at the end of the third quarter, so those numbers will come back up."

So a fair amount of energy around analytics. And -- but on the fee side, you really have areas like P2P, where many banks are charging for P2P and seeing reasonably good take-ups. At Investor Day, we're going to talk a bunch about how we're seeing the pricing moving in that space and how we believe banks are going to be able to actually create a very attractive stream of revenue, especially as real-time goes live on the fee side. So that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such strong success in terms of banks wanting to add that capability. Relationship Advance is another way that banks can serve a different kind of consumer that they typically wouldn't serve in a far more cost-effective way than that group of consumers would be able to get outside the network, seeing -- and seeing a lot of -- still a lot of energy on -- are there opportunities in prepaids, so just a lot of those different ways to increase revenue slowly.

And that -- and we have said very publicly that there are certain clients, right, that want things from us that -- for a price that we don't think makes sense, and therefore, we won't price it at certain levels. We believe that bill payment used right in terms of creating loyalty, creating retention, creating the use of the data and, frankly, the most fully featured best fraud-protected product in the market, we think, speaks for itself, and frankly, we believe that's why TD chose that. But it doesn't mean there isn't price out there that we deal with, and we do. But our goal is to create more differentiation in the product, especially when it becomes paired up with P2P. And we think that is one of the more important underlying connection points within the ""network of money movement."" Bill pay and P2P complement each other very well. They're not cannibalizing, they're complementary. So -- and again, we have the leading bank-centric online bill payment system as well as the online P2P system.

We believe we are on track to achieve increasing levels of high-quality revenue growth.
We also highlighted the important opportunities to expand operating margin, further enhance our already compelling free cash flow per share and our consistent and disciplined approach to capital. Our strategies are well aligned with the evolving market. We're enthusiastic about our multiple opportunities to create additional value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now onto the results.
We're pleased with our performance for the quarter and year-to-date and are well-positioned to achieve our expectations for the full year. We again generated strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS increasing 9% to $1.27 in the quarter, and is up 13% to $3.75 for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and is up 4% through September 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin increased sharply to 29.8%, 80 basis points over the prior year's quarter and up 50 basis points, sequentially.
Adjusted operating margin to date has increased 40 basis points to 29.3%, led by strong performance in the Financial segment and solid execution of our operational efficiency objectives.
Free cash flow increased 18% to $203 million compared with the third quarter of 2011, driven by strong growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date free cash flow was down slightly from the prior-year period to $501 million, primarily related to higher tax payments and working capital shifts early this year. We expect a strong free cash flow quarter to end the year.
For 2012, we identified 3 enterprise priorities when taken together represent key elements of our formula to create sustained shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhanced results for our clients. Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter as we benefited from robust sales and strong performance across our leading solutions such as Debit Account Processing and mobile. The combination of increased operating leverage and continued achievement of operational effectiveness goals resulted in 8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter and 80 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS growth was solid in the quarter as well, even net of a negative comparative tax impact, it has increased 15% through September 30.
We're on track for another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our focus on building a culture of growth continues to translate to strong growth performance. After the expected slow starts to the year, the second and third quarters had strong, above quarter performance, which included another major bill payment main, Region's Bank, that we announced at Investor Day. That transaction, along with the timing of signing of TD Bank in the second quarter, is factual evidence that financial institutions continue to design to significant product differentiation offered by CheckFree RXP. As we shared at the Investor Day, we expect to see revenue growth accelerated acceleration in our Bill payment business in 2013 and well beyond.
We had more than 140 known new Mobiliti signings in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our Account Processing and online banking client base. As the quarters end, we have nearly 1,300 mobile banking clients and is still significant growth opportunity driven by the combination of mobile adoption and new FI clients.
Our goal of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for our clients progress well in the quarter. We have several solutions that straddle the unique intersection of strong consumer value and financial institution revenue. A great example is Popmoney. We signed more than 100 new clients in the quarter, and now have over 1,700 institutions in the social payments network. We added BB&T Corporation, one of the largest financial holding companies in the U.S. to the top Popmoney network, which now includes 14 of the top 30 banks. We believe realtime transaction processing is a critical Fiserv differentiator. This capability should provide new revenue opportunities for our clients, which we believe will ultimately be measured in the billions. And it's important institutions can provide unique user experiences in areas such as social payments, expedited Bill pay, and SpotPay, our new product, which allows small business customers to accept card-based payments through a mobile phone courtesy of their own financial institution.
And as we shared at the Investor Day, our concept of expanding realtime movement is real now. In live Popmoney demonstrations, we've successfully debited the sender's account and credited the receiver's account at a different institution within 20 seconds of initiating the transaction. Integrating our proprietary DDA-based payments applications with our PIN-debit Network should create exceptional value for our clients and their customers, which will translate to a tract of new growth for Fiserv, a true win-win. With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the third quarter to $1.05 billion, an increased 4% in the first 9 months of 2012 to $3.1 billion. As anticipated, adjusted internal revenue growth in the third quarter accelerated over the second quarter to 4%, and is now at 3% year-to-date. Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.27 in the quarter an increased 13% to $3.75 through September 30.
Earnings in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to an almost 2 percentage point lower tax rate in the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted operating income was up 8% to $312 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, up 80 basis points over the prior year.
For the first 9 months, adjusted operating income increased 5% to $910 million, an adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 29.3% compared to the prior year. The combined license and termination fee revenue through September 30 is about the same as last year.
Now onto the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $548 million in the quarter, and is up 5% to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Card services and digital channels continue to drive strong internal revenue growth, which is partially offset by weaker performance in Bill payment, Investment Services and the continued negative Durbin impact on our Biller Solutions business. Bill payment transactions declined 2% in the quarter. This decline was due primarily to a lower number of nonweekend Bill payment processing days in September, which accounted for on approximate 3 percentage point decline in the quarter, which we expect will reverse in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate higher growth in our Bill payment business in 2013 in light of the recent large signings of TD Bank, Regions Bank and are still strong pipeline of additional opportunities.
Debit transactions grew 15% in the quarter and are up 18% year-to-date, primarily from better than market transaction growth and on boarding of new clients. We've added 125 new debit clients so far this year, and expect a strong sales finished to the year.
Our Popmoney ramp is continuing but transactions up 111% and 119% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Our focus on building the network is from critical, as more consumers are exposed to this new technology. As you know, Popmoney is yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue.
Operating income for the quarter was $168 million in the Payments segment compared with $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, operating income was $489 million compared to $482 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.7% for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year period and up 90 basis points sequentially. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin for this segment was down 90 basis points, primarily due to the impact of previously discussed Bill payment deconversions, the expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact of ramping up our all offerings in mobile and Online Banking.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment rebounded as anticipated, increasing 5% to $513 million in the quarter compared with the prior year. Year-to-date internal revenue growth was 3%. The timing of license revenue also rebounded in the quarter as expected compared to the second quarter this year. The gains in year-over-year revenue are primarily driven by recurring revenue growth in our Account Processing and Lending businesses.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 15% to $165 million for the quarter, and operating margin expanded by 270 basis points to 32.1%. This performance is driven by a number of factors, including higher license and termination fee revenue, efficiency gains and item processing, our operational effectiveness initiatives and an easier comparison to the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date, operating income was up 10% to $479 million, and operating margin has increased 190 basis points to 31.6%, in each case compared with the prior year.
The operating loss in the Corporate segment for the third quarter was $21 million, consistent with our second quarter operating loss, and $6 million greater than the third quarter last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, an increase of almost 2 percentage points over to 34.7% rate in 2011. Last year's third quarter rate was much lower due to a number of timing items that in the aggregate positively impacted the period.
Our full-year adjusted tax rate is projected to be approximately 36% and 37% in the fourth quarter. Net interest expenses declined $9 million year-to-date versus the prior year primarily due to lower interest rates.
Free cash flow rebounded nicely in the quarter, consistent with our plan of stronger second half performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $203 million compared to $172 million in the prior-year quarter, an increase of 18%. For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $501 million, down slightly to the prior year and negatively impacted in the current year by higher tax payments and incentive accruals paid in the first quarter of the year.
Free cash flow per share through September 30 was up 3% to $3.62 compared to the prior-year period.
Total debt at September 30 was $3.45 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA. In September, we raised $700 million of 10-year public debt at a coupon rate of 3.5%. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November of 2012.
The effective interest rate in the new debt will be higher than the coupon to the interest rate derivatives entered into a few years ago and several in conjunction with the recent transaction. However, the overall debt cost in the new financing will be lower than the existing term loan. We are very well-positioned with our debt structure. And after the paydown of our term loan in November, we will not have a mandatory principal payment until late 2015.
We repurchased 2.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $189 million and year-to-date, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for $577 million. As of September 30, they were approximately 6.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Sales in the quarter were again strong with quota attainment at 116%. Actual sales value in the quarter was more than 40% higher than last year's Q3 and just below the stellar results of this year's second quarter. Our digital channels and payments businesses lead the performance, including as we highlighted earlier, some great wins for our Popmoney and bill payment products. We are at 99% sales quota attainment on a straight-line basis through the end of the third quarter. Our qualified pipeline remains strong and is above where it was at this time last year. We expect to meet our annual sales target for the year. Integrated sales were also solid in the quarter, with payments and channel solutions again, experiencing the highest demand. Through the first 9 months of the year, integrated sales were $120 million, or roughly 60% of our annual target. We also expect to achieve our 2012 objective of $200 million.
We had another strong quarter of operational effectiveness performance and through September 30, are now at $45 million in cost savings or 113% of our full-year target.
As we shared at Investor Day, the environment facing financials institutions is stable but continues to be somewhat challenged. And while technology spend is growing slowly, it is still growing. We believe institutions will focus their technology decisions on areas that contribute to enhanced customer experience, create revenue and drive operational excellence. Technology solutions that deliver tangible, measurable value will likely get the lion's share of available spend and that lines up very well with our overall positioning. Through September 30, on the regulatory front, there have been 52 actions, down significantly from 91 in the same period last year.
Total assets of the impacted institutions are down significantly to about $10 billion compared with $34 billion in 2011. As we sat up front, we're on track to achieve results for 2012 within our guidance. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6%, and adjusted internal revenue growth in the 3% to 4.5% range, both with a bias at the lower end of the range for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year as compared to $4.58 in 2011. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand in the range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share to be at least $5.70 for the full year.
We continue to move the business forward each day with a singular day of making your company stronger. We have made strategic progress and remain bullish

And I think we had a slide up at Investor Day, which said that those 2 banks plus Zions had about 8 million accounts that would -- would potentially be able to be within or would potentially be able to take bill pay. And so if you just think about normal percentages of pay grade against that, it could be as low as 10% and typically, banks of that size are running at a higher level into the upper teens. So on a percentage basis, if you think about that relative to the 24 million active bill pay accounts we have today, that's probably the best way to think about it, knowing of course, that, that will ramp over time. So we think we'll have important contributions to our growth in '13, but as we have a -- we won't have a full year until we get into '14, we think that will be -- that will be strong growth. And we're also going to benefit on the anniversary-ing of some of the negatives like the Wachovia deconversion and a couple of remit and bar deconversions that we had this year as well."

We -- one of the things that we talked about at Investor Day at some depth, is the overall pressure that is in the financial institutional space and community banks nor credit unions are exempt from that. I think the capital requirements are the capital -- yes, the capital requirements under Basel III would certainly put more pressure on the industry. That said, most of the community bankers -- substantial majority of the community bankers that I interact with understand that the model is changing and that they need to make investments in technology that allow them to actually be more efficient, serve their customers in a different way and look for some other product opportunities to drive additional revenue. And that's one of the reasons why frankly, we're quite bullish about the technologies that we have within our suite. It's one of the reasons why we have such a strong take-up in things like Popmoney and Mobiliti. And as much of that is model be under pressure, the beauty of it is as these institutions have really taken the expense side down and really been more -- I think more prudent around their expense model, as revenues start to come back online and they certainly will at some point, you'll see more of a fall through. So I think most of the bankers are preparing for that inevitability. We are not at all bearish on the Community Banks base. We think it's an attractive space. We think structurally within the U.S. you need to have significant -- a significant Community Banks system and there's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that, that's going to change.

We have continued to win a large number of bill payment clients every quarter. So when we think about our transaction growth really benefit from 2 areas: we benefit from new wins within really the Account Processing Distribution platform; and then secondly, kind of the growth of transactions, kind of natural growth of transactions, which is a function of the number of makers that you have and the number of -- the number of transactions per maker. Frankly, since 2008, we've seen transactions be frankly lower as less people -- or people have been paying less bills. And so we've had -- we've had some issues with that and I think that's one of the things that's been running through the numbers. So part of the answer to the question is when will that stabilize? And we think it has. And we would expect to see -- we would expect to see that begin to move -- to move back up. I think the other thing that we talked about at Investor Day that we're really excited about is the opportunity to basically move bill payments at a faster basis, whether they're faster bill payments or expedited realtime. We think that is not going to just create interesting fee opportunities but how people use bill payment on a more frequent or more regular basis. So we think that will help as well. All of that said, I think it would be conjecture to understand, can we get that number back up to 6% to 9% without leaving deals? And I think the reality is we need to do all of that. We need to win deals, we need to continue to innovate our product to deliver better and more impactful ways for institutions to benefit from bill payment, and for consumers to use the technology. So I feel like we're in -- I feel like we're in a good position. I do think we're in a very strong transaction growth coming from these new wins. And frankly, we expect to continue to win -- win deals moving forward. So even though we have a pretty high penetration in call it the top 30 or so banks in the U.S., we have a pretty good opportunity to expand below the top 30 and to collect banks 30 to 100. And so we're quite focused on that area as well."

So we're confident there given it's only a few million dollars higher than we saw last year in Q4. So that gives us confidence. On the second point, which is really on the bill pay acceleration, we really see that growth coming from the wins that we have had, the anniversary-ing of the Wachovia, and some of the other deconverts that we talked about earlier in the year and obviously, offset by any discount we are to give to Bank of America. So, but we -- as we talked about in Investor Day, we had a good level of confidence and growth in '13, but not just in '13 as we talked about these transactions, institutions are going to ramp up, and we have a good, solid pipeline there, and we believe we'll continue to win transactions. And then last, from a Zions perspective, most of the growth that we see in '13 will not come from Zions. Zions would be smallest of the 3 big deals that we quantify. We'll get some nice growth there but it won't be the largest of all though."

And so from a sales standpoint, we feel good going into the finishing of the year in a strong basis. And a lot of those sales have been more recurring revenue or long term recurring revenue versus license and debt. That's a good thing for the long-term nature of our business. And especially the size of some of these wins, which are a lot larger than what we've seen as a company, kind of across-the-board when you look of the breadth of the wins that we have, not just in bill payment but in other areas.

Before I get to our results, let me thank each of you who joined us for our Annual Investor Conference, either in person or digitally, on October 9. We provided an update on our key solutions and how we're executing against our algorithm for growth. This formula sets forth how we intend to enhance revenue growth across our cadre of market-leading businesses and also our plans to scale our newer, innovation-based solutions, such as Popmoney and Mobiliti. We believe we are on track to achieve increasing levels of high-quality revenue growth.
We also highlighted the important opportunities to expand operating margin, further enhance our already compelling free cash flow per share and our consistent and disciplined approach to capital. Our strategies are well aligned with the evolving market. We're enthusiastic about our multiple opportunities to create additional value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now on to the results.
We're pleased with our performance for the quarter and year-to-date and are well positioned to achieve our expectations for the full year. We again generated strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS increasing 9% to $1.27 in the quarter and is up 13% to $3.75 for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and is up 4% through September 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin increased sharply to 29.8%, 80 basis points over the prior year's quarter and up 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin to date has increased 40 basis points to 29.3%, led by strong performance in the Financial segment and solid execution of our operational efficiency objectives.
Free cash flow increased 18% to $203 million compared with the third quarter of 2011, driven by strong growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date free cash flow was down slightly from the prior year period to $501 million, primarily related to higher tax payments and working capital shifts early this year. We expect a strong free cash flow quarter to end the year.
For 2012, we identified 3 enterprise priorities, when taken together, represent key elements of our formula to create sustained shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhanced results for our clients. Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we benefited from robust sales and strong performance across our leading solutions such as Debit Account Processing and Mobile. The combination of increased operating leverage and continued achievement of operational effectiveness goals resulted in 8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter and 80 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS growth was solid in the quarter as well. Even net of a negative comparative tax impact, it has increased 13% through September 30. We're on track for another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our focus on building a culture of growth continues to translate to strong sales performance. After the expected slow start to the year, the second and third quarters had strong, above-quarter performance, which included another major bill payment win, Regions Bank, that we announced at Investors Day. That transaction, along with the signing of signing of TD Bank in the second quarter, is factual evidence that financial institutions continue to desire the significant product differentiation offered by CheckFree RXP. As we shared at Investor Day, we expect to see revenue growth acceleration in our bill payment business in 2013 and well beyond.
We had more than 140 new Mobiliti signings in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our account processing and online banking client base. As of quarter's end, we have nearly 1,300 mobile banking clients and is still significant growth opportunity, driven by the combination of mobile adoption and new FI clients.
Our goal of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for our clients progress well in the quarter. We have several solutions that straddle the unique intersection of strong consumer value and financial institution revenue. A great example is Popmoney. We signed more than 100 new clients in the quarter and now have over 1,700 institutions in the social payments network. We added BB&T Corporation, one of the largest financial holding companies in the U.S. to the Popmoney network, which now includes 14 of the top 30 banks. 
We believe realtime transaction processing is a critical Fiserv differentiator. This capability should provide new revenue opportunities for our clients, which we believe will ultimately be measured in the billions. And it's important institutions can provide unique user experiences in areas such as social payments, expedited bill pay and SpotPay, our new product, which allows small business customers to accept card-based payments through a mobile phone, courtesy of their own financial institution.
And as we shared at Investor Day, our concept of expanding realtime movement is real now. In live Popmoney demonstrations, we've successfully debited the sender's account and credited the receiver's account at a different institution within 20 seconds of initiating the transaction. Integrating our proprietary DDA-based payments applications with our PIN-debit Network should create exceptional value for our clients and their customers, which will translate to attractive new growth for Fiserv, a true win-win. 
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the third quarter to $1.05 billion and increased 4% in the first 9 months of 2012 to $3.1 billion. As anticipated, adjusted internal revenue growth in the third quarter accelerated over the second quarter to 4% and is now at 3% year-to-date. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.27 in the quarter and increased 13% to $3.75 through September 30. Earnings in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to an almost 2-percentage-point lower tax rate in the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted operating income was up 8% to $312 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, up 80 basis points over the prior year. For the first 9 months, adjusted operating income increased 5% to $910 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 29.3% compared to the prior year. The combined license and termination fee revenue through September 30 is about the same as last year.
Now on to the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $548 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Card services and digital channels continue to drive strong internal revenue growth, which is partially offset by weaker performance in bill payment, investment services and the continued negative Durbin impact on our Biller Solutions business. 
Bill payment transactions declined 2% in the quarter. This decline is due primarily to a lower number of non-weekend bill payment processing days in September, which accounted for on approximate 3-percentage-point decline in the quarter, which, we expect, will reverse in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate higher growth in our bill payment business in 2013 in light of the recent large signings of TD Bank, Regions Bank and our still strong pipeline of additional opportunities.
Debit transactions grew 15% in the quarter and are up 18% year-to-date, primarily from better-than-market transaction growth and on-boarding the new clients. We've added 125 new debit clients so far this year and expect a strong sales finish to the year.
Our Popmoney ramp is continuing with transactions up 111% and 119% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Our focus on building the network is critical, as more consumers are exposed to this new technology. As you know, Popmoney is yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue.
Operating income for the quarter was $168 million in the Payments segment compared with $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, operating income was $489 million compared to $482 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.7% for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year period and up 90 basis points sequentially. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin for this segment was down 90 basis points, primarily due to the impact of previously discussed bill payment deconversions, the expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact of ramping up our offerings in mobile and online banking.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment rebounded as anticipated, increasing 5% to $513 million in the quarter compared with the prior year. Year-to-date internal revenue growth was 3%. The timing of license revenue also rebounded in the quarter, as expected, compared to the second quarter of this year. The gains in year-over-year revenue are primarily driven by recurring revenue growth in our account processing and lending businesses.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 15% to $165 million for the quarter, and operating margin expanded by 270 basis points to 32.1%. This performance is driven by a number of factors, including the higher license and termination fee revenue, efficiency gains and item processing, our operational effectiveness initiatives and an easier comparison to the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date, operating income was up 10% to $479 million, and operating margin has increased 190 basis points to 31.6%, in each case, compared with the prior year.
The operating loss in the Corporate segment for the third quarter was $21 million, consistent with our second quarter operating loss and $6 million greater than the third quarter last year. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, an increase of almost 2 percentage points over the 34.7% rate in 2011. Last year's third quarter rate was much lower due to a number of timing items that, in the aggregate, positively impacted the period.
Our full year adjusted tax rate is projected to be approximately 36% and 37% in the fourth quarter. Net interest expenses declined $9 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily due to lower interest rates.
Free cash flow rebounded nicely in the quarter, consistent with our plan of stronger second-half performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $203 million compared to $172 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 18%. For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $501 million, down slightly to the prior year and negatively impacted in the current year by higher tax payments and incentive accruals paid in the first quarter of the year. Free cash flow per share through September 30 was up 3% to $3.62 compared to the prior year period.
Total debt at September 30 was $3.45 billion or 2.4x trailing 12 months' EBITDA. In September, we raised $700 million of 10-year public debt at a coupon rate of 3.5%. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November of 2012. The effective interest rate in the new debt will be higher than the coupon to the interest rate derivatives entered into a few years ago and several in conjunction with the recent transaction. However, the overall debt cost in the new financing will be lower than the existing term loan. We are very, well positioned with our debt structure. And after the paydown of our term loan in November, we will not have a mandatory principal payment until late 2015.
We repurchased 2.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $189 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for $577 million. As of September 30, there were approximately 6.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Sales in the quarter were again strong with quota attainment at 116%. Actual sales value in the quarter was more than 40% higher than last year's Q3 and just below the stellar results of this year's second quarter. Our digital channels and payments businesses led the performance, including, as we highlighted earlier, some great wins for our Popmoney and bill payment products. We are at 99% sales quota attainment on a straight-line basis through the end of the third quarter. Our qualified pipeline remains strong and is above where it was at this time last year. We expect to meet our annual sales target for the year. 
Integrated sales were also solid in the quarter, with payments and channel solutions, again, experiencing the highest demand. Through the first 9 months of the year, integrated sales were $120 million or roughly 60% of our annual target. We also expect to achieve our 2012 objective of $200 million.
We had another strong quarter of operational effectiveness performance and, through September 30, are now at $45 million in cost savings or 113% of our full year target.
As we shared at Investor Day, the environment facing financial institutions is stable but continues to be somewhat challenged. And while technology spend is growing slowly, it is still growing. We believe institutions will focus their technology decisions on areas that contribute to enhanced customer experience, create revenue and drive operational excellence. Technology solutions that deliver tangible, measurable value will likely get the lion's share of available spend and that lines up very well with our overall positioning. 
Through September 30, on the regulatory front, there have been 52 actions, down significantly from 91 in the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down significantly to about $10 billion compared with $34 billion in 2011. 
As we sat up front, we're on track to achieve results for 2012 within our guidance. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth in the 3% to 4.5% range, both with a bias to the lower end of the range for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year, as compared to $4.58 in 2011. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand in the range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share to be at least $5.70 for the full year.
We continue to move the business forward each day, with a singular goal of making your company stronger. We have made strategic progress and remain bullish

And I think we had a slide up at Investor Day, which said that those 2 banks, plus Zions, had about 8 million accounts that would potentially be able to be within or would potentially be able to take bill pay.

So on a percentage basis, if you think about that, relative to the 24 million active bill pay accounts we have today, that's probably the best way to think about it, knowing of course, that, that will ramp over time. So we think they'll have important contributions to our growth in '13. But as we have a -- we won't have a full year until we get into '14. We think that'll be strong growth.

We -- one of the things that we talked about at Investor Day at some depth is the overall pressure that is in the financial institution space. And community banks nor credit unions are exempt from that. I think the capital requirements are the capital -- yes, the capital requirements under Basel III would certainly put more pressure on the industry. That said, most of the community bankers -- a substantial majority of the community bankers, that I interact with, understand that the model is changing and that they need to make investments in technology that allow them to actually be more efficient, serve their customers in a different way and look for some other product opportunities to drive additional revenue. And that's one of the reasons why, frankly, we're quite bullish about the technologies that we have within our suite. It's one of the reasons why we have such a strong take-up in things like Popmoney and Mobiliti. And as much as that model will be under pressure, the beauty of it is, as these institutions have really taken the expense side down and really been more -- I think more prudent around their expense model, as revenues start to come back online, and they certainly will at some point, you'll see more of a fall-through. So I think most of the bankers are preparing for that inevitability. We are not at all bearish on the community banks base. We think it's an attractive space. We think structurally within the U.S., you need to have significant -- a significant community bank system. And there's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that, that's going to change."

We have continued to win a large number of bill payment clients every quarter. So when we think about our transaction growth really benefit from 2 areas -- we benefit from new wins within really the account processing distribution platform. And then secondly, kind of the growth of transactions -- kind of natural growth of transactions, which is a function of the number of makers that you have and the number of transactions per maker. Frankly, since 2008, we've seen transactions be frankly lower as less people -- or people have been paying less bills. And so we've had some issues with that, and I think that's one of the things that's been running through the numbers. So part of the answer to the question is, when will that stabilize? And we think it has. And we would expect to see that begin to move back up. I think the other thing that we talked about at Investor Day, that we're really excited about, is the opportunity to basically move bill payments on a faster basis, whether they're faster bill payments or expedited or realtime. We think that is not going to just create interesting fee opportunities but how people use bill payment on a more frequent or regular basis. So we think that will help as well. All of that said, I think it would be conjecture to understand, can we get that number back up to 6% to 9% without winning deals? And I think the reality is, we need to do all of that. We need to win deals. We need to continue to innovate our product to deliver better and more impactful ways for institutions to benefit from bill payment and for consumers to use the technology. So I feel like we're in -- I think we're in a good position. I do think we'll see very strong transaction growth coming from these new wins. And frankly, we expect to continue to win deals moving forward. So even though we have a pretty high penetration in, call it, the top-30-or-so banks in the U.S., we have a pretty good opportunity to extend below the top 30 and to, call it, banks 30 to 100. And so we're quite focused on that area as well."

So we're confident there, given it's only a few million dollars higher than we saw last year in Q4. So that gives us confidence. On the second point, which is really on the bill pay acceleration, we really see that growth coming from the wins that we have had, the anniversary-ing of the Wachovia and some of the other deconverts that we talked about earlier in the year, and obviously, offset by the -- by any discount we were to give -- we are to give to Bank of America. So -- but we -- as we talked about in Investor Day, we have a good level of confidence and growth in '13, but not just in '13.

That's a good thing for the long-term nature of our business and especially, the size of some of these wins, which are a lot larger than what we've seen as a company, kind of across the board when you look at the breadth of the wins that we have, not just in bill payment but in other areas, larger transactions, which I think is contributing to that year-over-year increase in our performance in the third quarter of roughly 40% from a sales standpoint."

Before I get to our results, let me thank each of you who joined us for our Annual Investor Conference, either in person or digitally, on October 9. We provided an update on our key solutions and how we're executing against our algorithm for growth. This formula sets forth how we intend to enhance revenue growth across our cadre of market-leading businesses and also our plans to scale our newer, innovation-based solutions, such as Popmoney and Mobiliti. We believe we are on track to achieve increasing levels of high-quality revenue growth.
We also highlighted the important opportunities to expand operating margin, further enhance our already compelling free cash flow per share and our consistent and disciplined approach to capital. Our strategies are well aligned with the evolving market. We're enthusiastic about our multiple opportunities to create additional value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. Now on to the results.
We're pleased with our performance for the quarter and year-to-date and are well positioned to achieve our expectations for the full year. We again generated strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS increasing 9% to $1.27 in the quarter and is up 13% to $3.75 for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the quarter and is up 4% through September 30. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin increased sharply to 29.8%, 80 basis points over the prior year's quarter and up 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margin to date has increased 40 basis points to 29.3%, led by strong performance in the Financial segment and solid execution of our operational efficiency objectives.
Free cash flow increased 18% to $203 million compared with the third quarter of 2011, driven by strong growth in operating earnings and favorable shifts in working capital. Year-to-date free cash flow was down slightly from the prior year period to $501 million, primarily related to higher tax payments and working capital shifts early this year. We expect a strong free cash flow quarter to end the year.
For 2012, we identified 3 enterprise priorities, when taken together, represent key elements of our formula to create sustained shareholder value. First, to deliver an increased level of high-quality revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to more clients, deeper relationships and a larger share of our strategic solutions. And third, to deliver innovation that increases differentiation and enhances results for our clients. Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we benefited from robust sales and strong performance across our leading solutions such as Debit Account Processing and Mobile. The combination of increased operating leverage and continued achievement of operational effectiveness goals resulted in 8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter and 80 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS growth was solid in the quarter as well. Even net of a negative comparative tax impact, it has increased 13% through September 30. We're on track for another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Our focus on building a culture of growth continues to translate to strong sales performance. After the expected slow start to the year, the second and third quarters had strong, above-quarter performance, which included another major bill payment win, Regions Bank, that we announced at Investors Day. That transaction, along with the signing of signing of TD Bank in the second quarter, is factual evidence that financial institutions continue to desire the significant product differentiation offered by CheckFree RXP. As we shared at Investor Day, we expect to see revenue growth acceleration in our bill payment business in 2013 and well beyond.
We had more than 140 new Mobiliti signings in the quarter, driven largely by existing relationships in our account processing and online banking client base. As of quarter's end, we have nearly 1,300 mobile banking clients and a still significant growth opportunity, driven by the combination of mobile adoption and new FI clients.
Our goal of delivering differentiation and innovation that leads to better results for our clients progressed well in the quarter. We have several solutions that straddle the unique intersection of strong consumer value and financial institution revenue. A great example is Popmoney. We signed more than 100 new clients in the quarter and now have over 1,700 institutions in the social payments network. We added BB&T Corporation, one of the largest financial holding companies in the U.S. to the Popmoney network, which now includes 14 of the top 30 banks. 
We believe realtime transaction processing is a critical Fiserv differentiator. This capability should provide new revenue opportunities for our clients, which we believe will ultimately be measured in the billions. And it's important institutions can provide unique user experiences in areas such as social payments, expedited bill pay and SpotPay, our new product, which allows small business customers to accept card-based payments through a mobile phone, courtesy of their own financial institution.
And as we shared at Investor Day, our concept of expanding realtime movement is real now. In live Popmoney demonstrations, we've successfully debited the sender's account and credited the receiver's account at a different institution within 20 seconds of initiating the transaction. Integrating our proprietary DDA-based payments applications with our PIN-debit Network should create exceptional value for our clients and their customers, which will translate to attractive new growth for Fiserv, a true win-win. 
With that, let me hand the discussion to Tom, who will provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in the third quarter to $1.05 billion and increased 4% in the first 9 months of 2012 to $3.1 billion. As anticipated, adjusted internal revenue growth in the third quarter accelerated over the second quarter to 4% and is now at 3% year-to-date. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.27 in the quarter and increased 13% to $3.75 through September 30. Earnings in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to an almost 2-percentage-point lower tax rate in the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted operating income was up 8% to $312 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, up 80 basis points over the prior year. For the first 9 months, adjusted operating income increased 5% to $910 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 29.3% compared to the prior year. The combined license and termination fee revenue through September 30 is about the same as last year.
Now on to the segment results. Adjusted revenue in the Payments segment increased 4% to $548 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 2% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Card services and digital channels continue to drive strong internal revenue growth, which is partially offset by weaker performance in bill payment, investment services and the continued negative Durbin impact on our Biller Solutions business. 
Bill payment transactions declined 2% in the quarter. This decline is due primarily to a lower number of non-weekend bill payment processing days in September, which accounted for an approximate 3-percentage-point decline in the quarter, which, we expect, will reverse in the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate higher growth in our bill payment business in 2013 in light of the recent large signings of TD Bank, Regions Bank and our still strong pipeline of additional opportunities.
Debit transactions grew 15% in the quarter and are up 18% year-to-date, primarily from better-than-market transaction growth and on-boarding of new clients. We've added 125 new debit clients so far this year and expect a strong sales finish to the year.
Our Popmoney ramp is continuing with transactions up 111% and 119% in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Our focus on building the network is critical, as more consumers are exposed to this new technology. As you know, Popmoney is yet to meaningfully contribute to our revenue.
Operating income for the quarter was $168 million in the Payments segment compared with $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, operating income was $489 million compared to $482 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 30.7% for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year period and up 90 basis points sequentially. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin for the segment was down 90 basis points, primarily due to the impact of previously discussed bill payment deconversions, the expected dilution from the acquisition and integration of CashEdge and the impact of ramping up our offerings in mobile and online banking.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment rebounded as anticipated, increasing 5% to $513 million in the quarter compared with the prior year. Year-to-date internal revenue growth was 3%. The timing of license revenue also rebounded in the quarter, as expected, compared to the second quarter of this year. The gains in year-over-year revenue are primarily driven by recurring revenue growth in our account processing and lending businesses.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 15% to $165 million for the quarter, and operating margin expanded by 270 basis points to 32.1%. This performance is driven by a number of factors, including the higher license and termination fee revenue, efficiency gains and item processing, our operational effectiveness initiatives and an easier comparison to the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date, operating income was up 10% to $479 million, and operating margin has increased 190 basis points to 31.6%, in each case, compared with the prior year.
The operating loss in the Corporate segment for the third quarter was $21 million, consistent with our second quarter operating loss and $6 million greater than the third quarter last year. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, an increase of almost 2 percentage points over the 34.7% rate in 2011. Last year's third quarter rate was much lower due to a number of timing items that, in the aggregate, positively impacted the period.
Our full year adjusted tax rate is projected to be approximately 36% and 37% in the fourth quarter. Net interest expenses declined $9 million year-to-date versus the prior year, primarily due to lower interest rates.
Free cash flow rebounded nicely in the quarter, consistent with our plan of stronger second-half performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $203 million compared to $172 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 18%. For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $501 million, down slightly to the prior year and negatively impacted in the current year by higher tax payments and incentive accruals paid in the first quarter of the year. Free cash flow per share through September 30 was up 3% to $3.62 compared to the prior year period.
Total debt at September 30 was $3.45 billion or 2.4x trailing 12 months' EBITDA. In September, we raised $700 million of 10-year public debt at a coupon rate of 3.5%. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our $1.1 billion term loan, which is due in November of 2012. The effective interest rate on the new debt will be higher than the coupon due to the interest rate derivatives entered into a few years ago and settled in conjunction with the recent transaction. However, the overall debt cost on the new financing will be lower than the existing term loan. We are very well positioned with our debt structure. And after the paydown of our term loan in November, we will not have a mandatory principal payment until late 2015.
We repurchased 2.7 million shares of stock in the quarter for $189 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for $577 million. As of September 30, there were approximately 6.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Sales in the quarter were again strong with quota attainment at 116%. Actual sales value in the quarter was more than 40% higher than last year's Q3 and just below the stellar results of this year's second quarter. Our digital channels and payments businesses led the performance, including, as we highlighted earlier, some great wins for our Popmoney and bill payment products. We are at 99% sales quota attainment on a straight-line basis through the end of the third quarter. Our qualified pipeline remains strong and is above where it was at this time last year. We expect to meet our annual sales target for the year. 
Integrated sales were also solid in the quarter, with payments and channel solutions, again, experiencing the highest demand. Through the first 9 months of the year, integrated sales were $120 million or roughly 60% of our annual target. We also expect to achieve our 2012 objective of $200 million.
We had another strong quarter of operational effectiveness performance and, through September 30, are now at $45 million in cost savings or 113% of our full year target.
As we shared at Investor Day, the environment facing financial institutions is stable but continues to be somewhat challenged. And while technology spend is growing slowly, it is still growing. We believe institutions will focus their technology decisions on areas that contribute to enhanced customer experience, create revenue and drive operational excellence. Technology solutions that deliver tangible, measurable value will likely get the lion's share of available spend and that lines up very well with our overall positioning. 
Through September 30, on the regulatory front, there have been 52 actions, down significantly from 91 in the same period last year. Total assets of the impacted institutions are down significantly to about $10 billion compared with $34 billion in 2011. 
As we said up front, we're on track to achieve results for 2012 within our guidance. We continue to expect adjusted revenue to increase 4% to 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth in the 3% to 4.5% range, both with a bias to the lower end of the range for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 to $5.20, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year, as compared to $4.58 in 2011. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand in the range of 30 to 60 basis points for the full year, free cash flow growth of 8% to 12% and free cash flow per share to be at least $5.70 for the full year.

They'll have different dates. And I think we had a slide up at Investor Day, which said that those 2 banks, plus Zions, had about 8 million accounts that would potentially be able to be within or would potentially be able to take bill pay. And so if you just think about normal percentages of pay grade against that, it could be as low as 10%. And typically, banks of that size are running at a higher level into the upper teens. So on a percentage basis, if you think about that, relative to the 24 million active bill pay accounts we have today, that's probably the best way to think about it, knowing of course, that, that will ramp over time. So we think they'll have important contributions to our growth in '13. But as we have a -- we won't have a full year until we get into '14. We think that'll be strong growth. And we're also going to benefit from the anniversary-ing of some of the negatives, like the Wachovia deconversion and a couple of remit and bar deconversions that we had this year as well."

We -- one of the things that we talked about at Investor Day at some depth is the overall pressure that is in the financial institution space. And community banks nor credit unions are exempt from that. I think the capital requirements are the capital -- yes, the capital requirements under Basel III would certainly put more pressure on the industry. That said, most of the community bankers -- a substantial majority of the community bankers, that I interact with, understand that the model is changing and that they need to make investments in technology that allow them to actually be more efficient, serve their customers in a different way and look for some other product opportunities to drive additional revenue. And that's one of the reasons why, frankly, we're quite bullish about the technologies that we have within our suite. It's one of the reasons why we have such a strong take-up in things like Popmoney and Mobiliti. And as much as that model will be under pressure, the beauty of it is, as these institutions have really taken the expense side down and really been more -- I think more prudent around their expense model, as revenues start to come back online, and they certainly will at some point, you'll see more of a fall-through. So I think most of the bankers are preparing for that inevitability. We are not at all bearish on the community banks base. We think it's an attractive space. We think structurally within the U.S., you need to have significant -- a significant community bank system. And there's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that, that's going to change."

We have continued to win a large number of bill payment clients every quarter. So when we think about our transaction growth really benefit from 2 areas -- we benefit from new wins within really the account processing distribution platform. And then secondly, kind of the growth of transactions -- kind of natural growth of transactions, which is a function of the number of makers that you have and the number of transactions per maker. Frankly, since 2008, we've seen transactions be frankly lower as less people -- or people have been paying less bills. And so we've had some issues with that, and I think that's one of the things that's been running through the numbers. So part of the answer to the question is, when will that stabilize? And we think it has. And we would expect to see that begin to move back up. I think the other thing that we talked about at Investor Day, that we're really excited about, is the opportunity to basically move bill payments on a faster basis, whether they're faster bill payments or expedited or realtime. We think that is not going to just create interesting fee opportunities but have people use bill payment on a more frequent or regular basis. So we think that will help as well. All of that said, I think it would be conjecture to understand, can we get that number back up to 6% to 9% without winning deals? And I think the reality is, we need to do all of that. We need to win deals. We need to continue to innovate our product to deliver better and more impactful ways for institutions to benefit from bill payment and for consumers to use the technology. So I feel like we're in -- I think we're in a good position. I do think we'll see very strong transaction growth coming from these new wins. And frankly, we expect to continue to win deals moving forward. So even though we have a pretty high penetration in, call it, the top-30-or-so banks in the U.S., we have a pretty good opportunity to extend below the top 30 into, call it, banks 30 to 100. And so we're quite focused on that area as well."

So we're confident there, given it's only a few million dollars higher than we saw last year in Q4. So that gives us confidence. On the second point, which is really on the bill pay acceleration, we really see that growth coming from the wins that we have had, the anniversary-ing of the Wachovia and some of the other deconverts that we talked about earlier in the year, and obviously, offset by the -- by any discount we were to give -- we are to give to Bank of America. So -- but we -- as we talked about at Investor Day, we have a good level of confidence and growth in '13, but not just in '13. As we talked about these transactions, institutions are going to ramp up. And we have a good, solid pipeline there. And we believe we'll continue to win transactions. And then last, from a Zions perspective, most of the growth that we see in '13 will not come from Zions. Zions would be smallest of the 3 big deals that we quantify.

And so from a sales standpoint, we feel good going into the finishing out the year on a strong basis. And a lot of those sales have been more recurring revenue or long-term, recurring revenue versus license and debt. That's a good thing for the long-term nature of our business and especially, the size of some of these wins, which are a lot larger than what we've seen as a company, kind of across the board when you look at the breadth of the wins that we have, not just in bill payment but in other areas, larger transactions, which I think is contributing to that year-over-year increase in our performance in the third quarter of roughly 40% from a sales standpoint."

And I think you'll have a couple of million in each, because we have some in each segment. And so that's roughly where it was at."

So you've highlighted license wins and the termination fees as the less [ph] strength in the processing business. I was wondering how do you -- when you think about the fourth quarter and all the macroeconomic uncertainty, how should we think about Financial segment going forward? Just -- do you expect the same kind of license revenue strength to persist? And also, any indication on what the term fee expectations are for the fourth quarter?"

The -- as you know our business, we tend to have volatility as termination fees and license fees. And they move quarter-to-quarter. As I highlighted year-to-date, when you look at the first 9 months of the year compared to the prior year, our license fees and our term fees just about offset. So they're about flat when you look at that compared to the prior year period. And those can move around as we go from quarter-to-quarter. And we're not going to give guidance as we look into Q4 around termination fees, et cetera, or license fees. But that being said, we have historically performed well from a license fee standpoint in the fourth quarter compared to previous quarters. We continue to have a good pipeline there. We have to sell to a number of different financial institutions, but we're confident we're going to hit our guidance for the full year as we've laid out."
