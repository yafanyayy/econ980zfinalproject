35312,154195645,265044,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2012",2012-02-27,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results in comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash f",1680,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results in comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow and parent liquidity; and then finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we met or exceeded our 2011 guidance targets for all key financial metrics. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over 2010 and exceeds our guidance range. Importantly, AES' 2011 proportional free cash flow of $932 million is also at the high-end of our range, allowing us to achieve an all-time high for subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion.
Key drivers of this performance are the contributions of several new businesses, which came online in 2011; strong demand and volume growth in Latin America; as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates.
These positive trends offset the expense related to the acquisition of Dayton Power & Light, the impacts of the reserves required for the terror free Eletropaulo in Brazil, coupled with lower volumes and rates at several of our European businesses. 
As a reminder, as we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we had anticipated that the tariff in Eletropaulo was to be reset in July 2011, impacting the next 4 years. Although the formal tariff notification is still pending, we expect it to be finalized by July 2012, retroactive to July 2011.
Given that most of the terms of the tariff have now been determined by the regulator, we've been accruing for the projected impact of these changes since July 2011.
As also previously mentioned last quarter, this cost is approximately $104 million per quarter, resulting in an earnings per share impact of $0.015.
Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers of operating results. There are 3 key operating trends to highlight in our fourth quarter results. 
First, we recorded a higher volumes of our generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, compared to the same period last year. In particular, at GSA in Brazil, volumes grew 2% due to favorable weather conditions and higher demand at Eletropaulo.
With 4800 megawatts in operation in Chile and Colombia, also recorded higher electricity volumes due to beneficial weather and hydrological conditions, as well as continued energy demand growth supporting mining activities in the north of Chile.
Second, in Panama, we benefited from higher energy spot prices due to demand growth of approximately 5% and system supply constraints elsewhere, as well as business interruption insurance proceeds.
Third -- is also added to our strong fourth quarter results. This includes the Maritza facility in Bulgaria and the Angamos power plant in Chile, which commenced operations in June and April 2011, respectively. Both of these businesses made first-time contributions to fourth quarter results in 2011, as did DP&L.
Turning to our quarterly earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share declined by $0.02 to $0.23. This was the result of the DP&L expenses incurred prior to closing, with an impact of approximately $0.06, which offset the positive operating trends I just outlined.
Similarly, compared to a year earlier, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.04 to $0.12 for the quarter, driven by positive operating performance in Latin America but offset by DP&L transaction costs and unrealized foreign currency losses.
Now to address cash flow. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our guidance target in all of our cash flow measures for the year. This is a very positive indicator of our healthy and flowing operations. However, our cash flows from operations and free cash flow metrics declined from 2010 to 2011 on both the consolidated and proportional basis.
As you may recall, 2010 cash flows benefited from several one-time items, such as $107 million tax credit in Brazil, collection of outstanding receivables from the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil.
In 2011, we did not assume the recurrence of similar one-time benefits, and, in fact, in 2011, our cash flows were reduced by one-time factors. For example, we had large one-time tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the sale of our Brazil telecom business. In addition, the losses incurred in Eastern Energy, a business no longer part of the AES portfolio, reduced our 2011 cash flow year-over-year.
However, neither of these impacts will be ongoing and instead, both reflect positive actions taken within the portfolio as clearly indicated in the $284 million and pretax proceeds coming from the Brazil Telecom sale.
Furthermore, strong operating cash flows are quite apparent in our subsidiary distributions results, as we achieve an all-time high of $1.3 billion in 2011.
Now turning to parent liquidity. As you recall, in the second quarter of 2011, we had issued $2 billion of records debt at the parent to finance the acquisition of DP&L, which we closed in November. As a result, we finished the year with $693 million  in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we also invested $110 million in construction and development projects primarily to fund our renewable construction project.
In summary, 2011 was a strong year with the completion of 2000 megawatts of construction projects, the acquisition of DP&L and $15 million in permanent cost reductions achieved. This puts us well on track to achieve $50 million of savings per year in 2012 due to reduced business development costs and support function efficiency efforts.
As a result, we are well positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2012.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for 2012. Since we affirmed our 2012 guidance in November, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates had moved. As we typically do each year, we've updated our guidance to reflect changes in the forward curve for both commodities and foreign currencies through the end of the prior reporting period.
Using the forward curve as of the end of December and consistent with the sensitivities we provided in November, the impact our midpoint of adjusted EPS is a net reduction of approximately $0.06. Since that time, the forward recurve have rebounded somewhat. We'll continue to monitor this, as well as all other factors impacting our guidance and update you accordingly.
Thus, our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2012 is now $1.22 to $1.30, with the midpoint of $1.26, primarily reflecting these updated forward curves. The midpoint of $1.26 for this year reflects growth of 21% over the $1.04 we achieved in 2011.
Significant drivers of this will include: In 2011, we incurred $0.13 of acquisition and financing costs related to DP&L prior to its close. The largest driver of year-over-year growth is the contribution of new businesses, primarily Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, in total adding $0.17 to 2012.
In addition, from our existing businesses, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost reductions of $0.05 in 2012. Further, a reduced share can due to our 2011 share buyback at $0.02. As an offset to these factor, we have lower rates in 2012 primarily Eletropaulo in Brazil and Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, which will reduce adjusted EPS by $0.06.
We expect a slightly higher tax rate when novelty the impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. And we are currently projecting unfavorable foreign currency and commodity price movements of $0.07 versus the rates from full year 2011.
Keep in mind that our adjusted EPS guidance assumes the extension of TIPRA, tax legislation which impacts some part of the income and effective tax rate for 2012, which is an tax rate for 2011.
As in prior years, we expect Congress will extend this tax exemption sometime during the year, but is has not been passed since yet. If not extended, the impact to our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance would be approximately $0.12.
However, we believe that there may be additional actions we can take to help reduce this drag, if necessary.
Also note that only the cash and earnings impact of closed asset sales, including Brazil Telecom, the Bohemia plant in the Czech Republic, the Argentine distribution companies and Cartagena in Spain, our Incorporated in our 2012 guidance at this point in the year.
For example, the impacts of the pending Red Oak and Ironwood sales are not yet included and will not be until they closed. We believe the adjusted EPS impact of these transactions are limited, as a result of the attractive valuations we expect to achieve.
However, as we progress further in our asset sale program, we may experience some near-term dilution in our earnings until we can redeploy the proceeds.
As a result of all of these factors, our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint is now $1.26. Similar to adjusted earnings per share, cash flow trends are projected to be a very strong in 2012. Driven primarily by the contributions of our new businesses, we're expecting a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion proportional free cash flow. Our guidance midpoint for this metric represents an increase of 23% over 2011 result. With respect to subsidiary distributions, we're projecting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on the midpoint, we're expecting to achieve an increase of 7% in subsidiary distributions over our record high levels reduced in 2011.
Turning now to our 2012 near-term capital allocation plan. Over the course of 2012, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of organic parent free cash flow. This will be used to fund dividends, growth investments, share repurchases and parent debt repayments, based on the return price profile of opportunities available.
In addition, we expect to receive $460 million or more of asset sales proceeds over the course of 2012. Much of this cash is expected to be received in the second half of the year. The cash will be allocated in a total return framework for 2015, as Andres discussed.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

35312,154195645,265222,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2012",2012-02-27,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free c",1692,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow and parent liquidity; and then finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we met or exceeded our 2011 guidance targets for all key financial metrics. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over 2010 and exceeds our guidance range. Importantly, AES' 2011 proportional free cash flow of $932 million is also at the high end of our range, allowing us to achieve an all-time high for subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion.
Key drivers of this performance are the contributions of several new businesses, which came online in 2011; strong demand and volume growth in Latin America; as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These positive trends offset the expense related to the acquisition of Dayton Power & Light, the impacts of the reserves required for the terror-free sale at Eletropaulo in Brazil, coupled with lower volumes and rates at several of our European businesses. 
As a reminder, as we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we had anticipated that the tariff in Eletropaulo was to be reset in July 2011, impacting the next 4 years. Although the formal tariff notification is still pending, we expect it to be finalized by July 2012, retroactive to July 2011. Given that most of the terms of the tariff have now been determined by the regulator, we've been accruing for the projected impact of these changes since July 2011.
As also previously mentioned last quarter, this cost is approximately $104 million per quarter, resulting in an earnings per share impact of $0.015.
Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers of operating results. There are 3 key operating trends to highlight in our fourth quarter results. 
First, we recorded higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, compared to the same period last year. In particular, at GSA in Brazil, volumes grew 2% due to favorable weather conditions and higher demand at Eletropaulo.
Gener, with 4800 megawatts in operation in Chile and Colombia, also recorded higher electricity volumes due to beneficial weather and hydrological conditions, as well as continued energy demand growth supporting mining activities in the north of Chile.
Second, in Panama, we benefited from higher energy spot prices due to demand growth of approximately 5% and system supply constraints elsewhere, as well as business interruption insurance proceeds.
Third, our new business also added to our strong fourth quarter results. These include the Maritza facility in Bulgaria and the Angamos power plant in Chile, which commenced operations in June and April 2011, respectively. Both of these businesses made first-time contributions to fourth quarter results in 2011, as did DP&L.
Turning to our quarterly earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share declined by $0.02 to $0.23. This was the result of the DP&L expenses incurred prior to closing, with an impact of approximately $0.06, which offset the positive operating trends I just outlined.
Similarly, compared to a year earlier, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.04 to $0.12 for the quarter, driven by positive operating performance in Latin America, but offset by DP&L transaction costs and unrealized foreign currency losses.
Now to address cash flow. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our guidance targets on all of our cash flow metrics for the year. This is a very positive indicator of our healthy and growing operations. However, our cash flows from operations and free cash flow metrics declined from 2010 to 2011 on both a consolidated and proportional basis.
As you may recall, 2010 cash flows benefited from several one-time items, such as $107 million tax credit in Brazil, collection of outstanding receivables from the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil.
In 2011, we did not assume the recurrence of similar one-time benefits, and in fact, in 2011, our cash flows were reduced by some one-time impactors. For example, we had a large one-time tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the sale of our Brazil telecoms business. In addition, the losses incurred in Eastern Energy, a business no longer part of the AES portfolio, reduced our 2011 cash flow year-over-year.
However, neither of these impacts will be ongoing and instead, both reflect positive actions taken within the portfolio as clearly indicated in the $284 million in pre-tax proceeds coming from the Brazil Telecom sale.
Furthermore, our strong operating cash flows are quite apparent in our subsidiary distribution results, as AES [ph] achieved an all-time high of $1.3 billion in 2011.
Now turning to parent liquidity. As you recall, in the second quarter of 2011, we had issued $2 billion of recourse debt at the parent to finance the acquisition of DP&L, which we closed in November. As a result, we finished the year with $693 million in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we also invested $110 million in construction and development projects, primarily to fund our renewable construction projects.
In summary, 2011 was a strong year with the completion of 2000 megawatts of construction projects, the acquisition of DP&L and $15 million in permanent cost reductions achieved. This puts us well on track to achieve $50 million of savings per year in 2012 due to reduced business development costs and support function efficiency efforts. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a significant earnings growth in 2012.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for 2012. Since we affirmed our 2012 guidance in November, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates have moved. As we typically do each year, we've updated our guidance to reflect changes in the forward curve for both commodities and foreign currencies through the end of the prior reporting period.
Using the forward curves as of the end of December and consistent with the sensitivities we provided in November, the impact to our midpoint of adjusted EPS is a net reduction of approximately $0.06. Since that time, the forward curves have rebounded somewhat. We'll continue to monitor this, as well as all other factors impacting our guidance and update you accordingly.
Thus, our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2012 is now $1.22 to $1.30, with the midpoint of $1.26, primarily reflecting these updated forward curves. The midpoint of $1.26 for this year reflects growth of 21% over the $1.04 we achieved in 2011.
Significant drivers of this will include: in 2011, we incurred $0.13 of acquisition and financing costs related to DP&L prior to its close. The largest driver of year-over-year growth is the contribution of new businesses, primarily Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, in total, adding $0.17 to 2012.
In addition, from our existing businesses, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost reductions of $0.05 mix in 2012. Further, a reduced share count due to our 2011 share buybacks at $0.02. As an offset to this factor, we have lower rates in 2012, primarily Eletropaulo in Brazil and  at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, which will reduce adjusted EPS by $0.06.
We expect the slightly higher tax rate will negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. And we are currently projecting unfavorable foreign currency and commodity price movements of $0.07 versus the rates from full-year 2011.
Keep in mind that our adjusted EPS guidance assumes the extension of TIPRA, tax legislation which impacts some part of the income and an effective tax rate for 2012, which is in line with our tax rate for 2011.
As in prior years, we expect Congress will extend this tax exemption sometime during the year, but it has not been passed as yet. If TIPAR is not extended, the impact to our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance would be approximately $0.12. However, we believe that there may be additional actions we can take to help reduce this drag if necessary.
Also note that only the cash and earnings impacts of closed asset sales, including Brazil Telecom, the Bohemia plant in the Czech Republic, the Argentine distribution companies and Cartagena in Spain are incorporated in our 2012 guidance at this point in the year.
For example, the impacts of the pending Red Oak and Ironwood sales are not yet included and will not be until they close. We believe the adjusted EPS impacts of these transactions are limited, as a result of the attractive valuations we expect to achieve. However, as we progress further in our asset-sale program, we may experience some near-term dilution in our earnings until we can redeploy the proceeds. As a result of all of these factors, our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint is now $1.26. 
Similar to adjusted earnings per share, cash flow trends are projected to be very strong in 2012. Driven primarily by the contributions of our new businesses, we're expecting a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion proportional free cash flow. Our guidance midpoint for this metric represents an increase of 23% over 2011 results. With respect to subsidiary distributions, we're projecting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on the midpoint, we're expecting to achieve an increase of 7% in subsidiary distributions over our record-high levels reduced in 2011.
Turning now to our 2012 near-term capital allocation plan. Over the course of 2012, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of organic parent free cash flow. This will be used to fund dividends, growth investments, share repurchases and parent debt repayments, based on the return price profile of opportunities available.
In addition, we expect to receive $450 million or more of asset-sale proceeds over the course of 2012. Much of this cash is expected to be received in the second half of the year. The cash will be allocated in the total return framework for 2015, as Andres discussed.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

35312,154195645,265365,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2012",2012-02-27,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free c",1692,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow and parent liquidity; and then finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we met or exceeded our 2011 guidance targets for all key financial metrics. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over 2010 and exceeds our guidance range. Importantly, AES' 2011 proportional free cash flow of $932 million is also at the high end of our range, allowing us to achieve an all-time high for subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion.
Key drivers of this performance are the contributions of several new businesses, which came online in 2011; strong demand and volume growth in Latin America; as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These positive trends offset the expense related to the acquisition of Dayton Power & Light, the impacts of the reserves required for the terror-free sale at Eletropaulo in Brazil, coupled with lower volumes and rates at several of our European businesses. 
As a reminder, as we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we had anticipated that the tariff in Eletropaulo was to be reset in July 2011, impacting the next 4 years. Although the formal tariff notification is still pending, we expect it to be finalized by July 2012, retroactive to July 2011. Given that most of the terms of the tariff have now been determined by the regulator, we've been accruing for the projected impact of these changes since July 2011.
As also previously mentioned last quarter, this cost is approximately $104 million per quarter, resulting in an earnings per share impact of $0.015.
Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers of operating results. There are 3 key operating trends to highlight in our fourth quarter results. 
First, we recorded higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, compared to the same period last year. In particular, at GSA in Brazil, volumes grew 2% due to favorable weather conditions and higher demand at Eletropaulo.
Gener, with 4800 megawatts in operation in Chile and Colombia, also recorded higher electricity volumes due to beneficial weather and hydrological conditions, as well as continued energy demand growth supporting mining activities in the north of Chile.
Second, in Panama, we benefited from higher energy spot prices due to the demand growth of approximately 5% and system supply constraints elsewhere, as well as business interruption insurance proceeds.
Third, our new businesses also added to our strong fourth quarter results. These include the Maritza facility in Bulgaria and the Angamos power plant in Chile, which commenced operations in June and April 2011, respectively. Both of these businesses made first-time contributions to fourth quarter results in 2011, as did DP&L.
Turning to our quarterly earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share declined by $0.02 to $0.23. This was the result of the DP&L expenses incurred prior to closing, with an impact of approximately $0.06, which offset the positive operating trends I just outlined.
Similarly, compared to a year earlier, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.04 to $0.12 for the quarter, driven by positive operating performance in Latin America, but offset by DP&L transaction costs and unrealized foreign currency losses.
Now to address cash flow. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our guidance targets on all of our cash flow metrics for the year. This is a very positive indicator of our healthy and growing operations. However, our cash flows from operations and free cash flow metrics declined from 2010 to 2011 on both a consolidated and proportional basis.
As you may recall, 2010 cash flows benefited from several one-time items, such as $107 million tax credit in Brazil, collection of outstanding receivables from the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil.
In 2011, we did not assume the recurrence of similar one-time benefits, and in fact, in 2011, our cash flows were reduced by some one-time impactors. For example, we had a large one-time tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the sale of our Brazil telecoms business. In addition, the losses incurred in Eastern Energy, a business no longer part of the AES portfolio, reduced our 2011 cash flow year-over-year.
However, neither of these impacts will be ongoing and instead, both reflect positive actions taken within the portfolio as clearly indicated in the $284 million in pre-tax proceeds coming from the Brazil Telecom sale.
Furthermore, our strong operating cash flows are quite apparent in our subsidiary distribution results, as we achieved an all-time high of $1.3 billion in 2011.
Now turning to parent liquidity. As you recall, in the second quarter of 2011, we had issued $2 billion of recourse debt at the parent to finance the acquisition of DP&L, which we closed in November. As a result, we finished the year with $693 million in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we also invested $110 million in construction and development projects, primarily to fund our renewable construction projects.
In summary, 2011 was a strong year with the completion of 2000 megawatts of construction projects, the acquisition of DP&L and $15 million in permanent cost reductions achieved. This puts us well on track to achieve $50 million of savings per year in 2012 due to reduced business development costs and support function efficiency efforts. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a significant earnings growth in 2012.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for 2012. Since we affirmed our 2012 guidance in November, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates have moved. As we typically do each year, we've updated our guidance to reflect changes in the forward curve for both commodities and foreign currencies through the end of the prior reporting period.
Using the forward curves as of the end of December and consistent with the sensitivities we provided in November, the impact to our midpoint of adjusted EPS is a net reduction of approximately $0.06. Since that time, the forward curves have rebounded somewhat. We'll continue to monitor this, as well as all other factors impacting our guidance and update you accordingly.
Thus, our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2012 is now $1.22 to $1.30, with the midpoint of $1.26, primarily reflecting these updated forward curves. The midpoint of $1.26 for this year reflects growth of 21% over the $1.04 we achieved in 2011.
Significant drivers of this will include: in 2011, we incurred $0.13 of acquisition and financing costs related to DP&L prior to its close. The largest driver of year-over-year growth is the contribution of new businesses, primarily Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, in total, adding $0.17 to 2012.
In addition, from our existing businesses, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost reductions of $0.05 mix in 2012. Further, a reduced share count due to our 2011 share buybacks adds $0.02. As an offset to this factor, we have lower rates in 2012, primarily Eletropaulo in Brazil and at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, which will reduce adjusted EPS by $0.06.
We expect the slightly higher tax rate will negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. And we are currently projecting unfavorable foreign currency and commodity price movements of $0.07 versus the rates for full-year 2011.
Keep in mind that our adjusted EPS guidance assumes the extension of TIPRA, tax legislation which impacts some part of the income and an effective tax rate for 2012, which is in line with our tax rate for 2011.
As in prior years, we expect Congress will extend this tax exemption sometime during the year, but it has not been passed as yet. If TIPAR is not extended, the impact to our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance would be approximately $0.12. However, we believe that there may be additional actions we can take to help reduce this drag if necessary.
Also note that only the cash and earnings impacts of closed asset sales, including Brazil Telecom, the Bohemia plant in the Czech Republic, the Argentine distribution companies and Cartagena in Spain are incorporated in our 2012 guidance at this point in the year.
For example, the impacts of the pending Red Oak and Ironwood sales are not yet included and will not be until they close. We believe the adjusted EPS impacts of these transactions are limited, as a result of the attractive valuations we expect to achieve. However, as we progress further in our asset-sale program, we may experience some near-term dilution in our earnings until we can redeploy the proceeds. As a result of all of these factors, our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint is now $1.26. 
Similar to adjusted earnings per share, cash flow trends are projected to be very strong in 2012. Driven primarily by the contributions of our new businesses, we're expecting a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion proportional free cash flow. Our guidance midpoint for this metric represents an increase of 23% over 2011 results. With respect to subsidiary distributions, we're projecting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on the midpoint, we're expecting to achieve an increase of 7% in subsidiary distributions over our record-high levels produced in 2011.
Turning now to our 2012 near-term capital allocation plan. Over the course of 2012, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of organic parent free cash flow. This will be used to fund dividends, growth investments, share repurchases and parent debt repayments, based on the return price profile of opportunities available.
In addition, we expect to receive $460 million or more of asset-sale proceeds over the course of 2012. Much of this cash is expected to be received in the second half of the year. The cash will be allocated in the total return framework for 2015, as Andres discussed.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

35312,154195645,266078,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2012",2012-02-27,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free c",1692,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow and parent liquidity; and then finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we met or exceeded our 2011 guidance targets for all key financial metrics. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over 2010 and exceeds our guidance range. Importantly, AES' 2011 proportional free cash flow of $932 million is also at the high end of our range, allowing us to achieve an all-time high for subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion.
Key drivers of this performance are the contributions of several new businesses, which came online in 2011; strong demand and volume growth in Latin America; as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These positive trends offset the expense related to the acquisition of Dayton Power & Light, the impacts of the reserves required for the terror-free sale at Eletropaulo in Brazil, coupled with lower volumes and rates at several of our European businesses. 
As a reminder, as we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we had anticipated that the tariff in Eletropaulo was to be reset in July 2011, impacting the next 4 years. Although the formal tariff notification is still pending, we expect it to be finalized by July 2012, retroactive to July 2011. Given that most of the terms of the tariff have now been determined by the regulator, we've been accruing for the projected impact of these changes since July 2011.
As also previously mentioned last quarter, this cost is approximately $104 million per quarter, resulting in an earnings per share impact of $0.015.
Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers of operating results. There are 3 key operating trends to highlight in our fourth quarter results. 
First, we recorded higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, compared to the same period last year. In particular, at GSA in Brazil, volumes grew 2% due to favorable weather conditions and higher demand at Eletropaulo.
Gener, with 4800 megawatts in operation in Chile and Colombia, also recorded higher electricity volumes due to beneficial weather and hydrological conditions, as well as continued energy demand growth supporting mining activities in the north of Chile.
Second, in Panama, we benefited from higher energy spot prices due to the demand growth of approximately 5% and system supply constraints elsewhere, as well as business interruption insurance proceeds.
Third, our new businesses also added to our strong fourth quarter results. These include the Maritza facility in Bulgaria and the Angamos power plant in Chile, which commenced operations in June and April 2011, respectively. Both of these businesses made first-time contributions to fourth quarter results in 2011, as did DP&L.
Turning to our quarterly earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share declined by $0.02 to $0.23. This was the result of the DP&L expenses incurred prior to closing, with an impact of approximately $0.06, which offset the positive operating trends I just outlined.
Similarly, compared to a year earlier, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.04 to $0.12 for the quarter, driven by positive operating performance in Latin America, but offset by DP&L transaction costs and unrealized foreign currency losses.
Now to address cash flow. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our guidance targets on all of our cash flow metrics for the year. This is a very positive indicator of our healthy and growing operations. However, our cash flows from operations and free cash flow metrics declined from 2010 to 2011 on both a consolidated and proportional basis.
As you may recall, 2010 cash flows benefited from several one-time items, such as $107 million tax credit in Brazil, collection of outstanding receivables from the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil.
In 2011, we did not assume the recurrence of similar one-time benefits, and in fact, in 2011, our cash flows were reduced by some one-time impactors. For example, we had a large one-time tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the sale of our Brazil telecoms business. In addition, the losses incurred in Eastern Energy, a business no longer part of the AES portfolio, reduced our 2011 cash flow year-over-year.
However, neither of these impacts will be ongoing and instead, both reflect positive actions taken within the portfolio as clearly indicated in the $284 million in pre-tax proceeds coming from the Brazil Telecom sale.
Furthermore, our strong operating cash flows are quite apparent in our subsidiary distribution results, as we achieved an all-time high of $1.3 billion in 2011.
Now turning to parent liquidity. As you recall, in the second quarter of 2011, we had issued $2 billion of recourse debt at the parent to finance the acquisition of DP&L, which we closed in November. As a result, we finished the year with $693 million in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we also invested $110 million in construction and development projects, primarily to fund our renewable construction projects.
In summary, 2011 was a strong year with the completion of 2000 megawatts of construction projects, the acquisition of DP&L and $15 million in permanent cost reductions achieved. This puts us well on track to achieve $50 million of savings per year in 2012 due to reduced business development costs and support function efficiency efforts. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a significant earnings growth in 2012.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for 2012. Since we affirmed our 2012 guidance in November, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates have moved. As we typically do each year, we've updated our guidance to reflect changes in the forward curve for both commodities and foreign currencies through the end of the prior reporting period.
Using the forward curves as of the end of December and consistent with the sensitivities we provided in November, the impact to our midpoint of adjusted EPS is a net reduction of approximately $0.06. Since that time, the forward curves have rebounded somewhat. We'll continue to monitor this, as well as all other factors impacting our guidance and update you accordingly.
Thus, our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2012 is now $1.22 to $1.30, with the midpoint of $1.26, primarily reflecting these updated forward curves. The midpoint of $1.26 for this year reflects growth of 21% over the $1.04 we achieved in 2011.
Significant drivers of this will include: in 2011, we incurred $0.13 of acquisition and financing costs related to DP&L prior to its close. The largest driver of year-over-year growth is the contribution of new businesses, primarily Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, in total, adding $0.17 to 2012.
In addition, from our existing businesses, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost reductions of $0.05 mix in 2012. Further, a reduced share count due to our 2011 share buybacks adds $0.02. As an offset to this factor, we have lower rates in 2012, primarily Eletropaulo in Brazil and at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, which will reduce adjusted EPS by $0.06.
We expect the slightly higher tax rate will negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. And we are currently projecting unfavorable foreign currency and commodity price movements of $0.07 versus the rates for full-year 2011.
Keep in mind that our adjusted EPS guidance assumes the extension of TIPRA, tax legislation which impacts some part of the income and an effective tax rate for 2012, which is in line with our tax rate for 2011.
As in prior years, we expect Congress will extend this tax exemption sometime during the year, but it has not been passed as yet. If TIPAR is not extended, the impact to our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance would be approximately $0.12. However, we believe that there may be additional actions we can take to help reduce this drag if necessary.
Also note that only the cash and earnings impacts of closed asset sales, including Brazil Telecom, the Bohemia plant in the Czech Republic, the Argentine distribution companies and Cartagena in Spain are incorporated in our 2012 guidance at this point in the year.
For example, the impacts of the pending Red Oak and Ironwood sales are not yet included and will not be until they close. We believe the adjusted EPS impacts of these transactions are limited, as a result of the attractive valuations we expect to achieve. However, as we progress further in our asset-sale program, we may experience some near-term dilution in our earnings until we can redeploy the proceeds. As a result of all of these factors, our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint is now $1.26. 
Similar to adjusted earnings per share, cash flow trends are projected to be very strong in 2012. Driven primarily by the contributions of our new businesses, we're expecting a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion proportional free cash flow. Our guidance midpoint for this metric represents an increase of 23% over 2011 results. With respect to subsidiary distributions, we're projecting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on the midpoint, we're expecting to achieve an increase of 7% in subsidiary distributions over our record-high levels produced in 2011.
Turning now to our 2012 near-term capital allocation plan. Over the course of 2012, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of organic parent free cash flow. This will be used to fund dividends, growth investments, share repurchases and parent debt repayments, based on the return price profile of opportunities available.
In addition, we expect to receive $460 million or more of asset-sale proceeds over the course of 2012. Much of this cash is expected to be received in the second half of the year. The cash will be allocated in the total return framework for 2015, as Andres discussed.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported solid performance in the fourth quarter.For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 6%, a",1976,"Thanks, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported solid performance in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 6%, and we achieved record subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion. Despite a volatile macroeconomic and commodity price environment, we met or exceeded our 2011's guidance of all key earnings and cash flow metrics.
We also delivered on our key strategic initiatives, including several large asset sales, closing on a major acquisition and commissioning 2000 megawatts of new generation capacity.
Before I delve into the detail of these initiatives, I would like to share my thoughts on 2 key questions that I heard repeatedly during our meetings with investors and analysts during our East and West Coast Roadshows. The first was asking for greater clarity regarding our capital allocation strategy and the second was projected earnings and cash flow growth beyond 2012.
As I said on our last call, we intend to maximize shareholder value by flowing our businesses in those markets, where we have – or have a heavy plan to create a competitive advantage, exiting over time, those markets where we do not and focusing on creating value on a per-share basis by competing investment in growth with debt paydowns and share buybacks. Our discretionary cash consists of our distribution from subsidiaries, plus proceeds from asset sales, less corporate overhead, taxes and interest payments. 
We will allocate our discretionary cash to 3 primary uses: first, repayment of recourse debt at the parent. I believe that decreasing our leverage will help improve the market's perception of AES' risk profile. In a volatile global financial environment, less perceived risk should improve our valuation. Here, our goal is to achieve at least a one notch upgrade to double-B over the medium term, and we intend to pay down at least $500 million of parent debt. 
Second, we will use our discretionary cash to fund growth projects and/or repurchase shares. Our goal is to invest to create the most value on a per-share basis. I want to make it very clear that when it comes to investing in growth projects, these will be benchmarked against debt paydowns and share repurchases. For any investment, we will consider its strategic fit, its adjusted earnings per share and dividend contributions, as well as the net present value created and its capital efficiency, measured as NPV over AES equity investment.
In order to ensure the optimal allocation of capital, we have formed an investment committee, which evaluates our pipeline of all possible investment alternatives in light of the criteria I previously mentioned. To align individual incentives with our objective, we revised compensation plan to be based both on project NPV and capital efficiency metrics. We expect that these changes will improve our return on invested capital and create significantly more shareholder value over time.
Regarding the development and construction of new assets, our primary focus will be on platform expansion in those markets where we believe we have a compelling competitive advantage. As a reminder, our core markets are Brazil, Chile and United States. In addition, we have growth projects underway in Turkey, the Philippines and India.
By focusing on platform expansions rather than entering new countries, we can improve the average returns and hit rates while spending less on business development. 
I would like to highlight a few important projects in our development pipeline. In Chile, we are making good progress in developing the Cochrane project, a 552-megawatt coal project, including a 24-megawatt lithium battery, energy storage system adjacent to our new Angamos facility and Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt hydroelectric project near Santiago. Both are essentially expansions of existing facilities.
In Turkey, we announced an agreement to develop a 625-megawatt coal project with our partner Koç, and in addition, Oyak, one of the leading pension funds in the country. Finally, in the Philippines and India, we are well positioned to add up to 1800 megawatts by expanding our Masinloc and OPGC plants. 
In certain markets such as Brazil, Chile and India, we have cash on hand and the ability to tap local funding sources, both equity and debt, so we can grow without depending on additional cash from the quarter.
With regard to share repurchases, we've been buying back our stock since July 2010, and as we discussed on our third quarter call, we have repurchased a total of 33.9 million shares at an average price of $11.14. However, in the fourth quarter, we used our liquidity to fund our Dayton Power & Light acquisition and as a result, we have not bought back stock since. Therefore, as of today, we still have $122 million remaining under our current authorization for share buybacks. Third, as you know, we intend to initiate an annual dividend of $120 million in the third quarter of 2012 with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter. I realized that we're starting with a relatively low yield of approximately 1.1%. However, as our earnings and current free cash flow grow over time, we expect to increase the dividend to be more in line with the average yield in the market.
Now turning to our expected long-term growth rate. As we announced in our press release, we expect to achieve a 21% adjusted EPS growth rate this year. Beyond 2012, starting from our guidance midpoint of $1.26 in earnings, we expect to deliver average annual total returns of 8% to 10% through 2015. This total return to shareholders will consist of 2 components.
First, we expect a compounded annual adjusted EPS growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2013 through 2015 from the following: our existing portfolio of assets. This will be driven primarily by demand growth in our faster growing markets and profitability improvements across the portfolio; completion of the 2300 megawatts of new generation under construction. Although this will be a modest contributor to the growth rate as the largest of these projects, Mong Duong in Vietnam, will not come online until 2015; achieving an additional $50 million of cost savings by the end of 2013 as we discussed in our last call; and improved allocation of our discretionary cash through a combination of parent debt repayment, share buybacks and investments.
The base case assumes a mix of debt repayment and share repurchases that is target to achieve our credit metric goals. Investments and acquisitions would have to be accretive to the base case scenario. 
The second component of our total annual returns is a $120 million annual dividend we will declare starting the third quarter of this year. The dividend represents 1.1% of our total average annual return target of 8% to 10%. I would note that our average annual total return target of 8% to 10% does not assume any expansion of our P/E multiple. Any improvement of our P/E multiple, as a result of an improving risk profile, would represent upside to our total return commitment.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on our portfolio and other initiatives, including recent asset sales, integration of Dayton Power & Light and our completed construction projects and construction pipeline.
For asset sales, we are executing on our plans to narrow our geographic and line of business focus by exiting nonstrategic markets over time. We believe that we can create more shareholder value by selling nonstrategic assets and redeploying those proceeds in accordance with our capital allocation strategy.
As I discussed in the past, we're targeting up to $2 billion of proceeds through AES from asset sales over the next few years. I am pleased to announce that we are more than 1/3 of the way towards achieving that goal. Since September of 2011, we have closed 4 asset sales, representing approximately $530 million in proceeds to AES: Atimus, the Brazil Telecom, 2 Argentine distribution companies and our plants in the Czech Republic and Spain. We have also announced 2 new transactions in the past few weeks: the sale of Red Oak and Ironwood, 2 gas-fired plants in the U.S. for a total net proceeds of $230 million.
These transactions demonstrate the potential value creation of asset sales. Collectively, these businesses represent $32 million of net income to AES in 2011. With proceeds of approximately $760 million for all the asset sales closed or announced since September, we achieved a P/E multiple of 23x 2011 earnings.
Now let me update you on our Dayton Power & Light acquisition. As you know, the deal closed in November of last year in record time, only 7 months after its announcement. The integration of DP&L is on track, and we are preparing for the Standard Service Offering filing with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio in late March, with a new tariff to be effective in January 2013.
We remain pleased with the strategic fit that DP&L will provide, and we look for sourcing opportunities and other platform benefits to be derived over the medium term. DP&L is well positioned to benefit from coming environmental regulations as the majority of its fleet has already been scrubbed. In addition, as we explained in the past, the acquisition will help us monetize our $2.1 billion of net operating losses.
Since the acquisition closed in November, however, we have seen margin reduction at DP&L, primarily driven by lower gas prices, as well as increased customer switching. To that end, lower gas prices have negatively affected our 2012 outlook for DP&L's earnings contribution to AES by approximately $0.03.
As is the case with other Ohio utilities, DP&L is experiencing higher customer switching rates, primarily due to the impact of weak gas prices on power prices. This also makes customer shopping more attractive. 
To give you some perspective, in 2011, 47% of total retail sales had switched to alternate suppliers, up from 32% in 2010. Although DP&L's retail arm was able to capture 87% of the switch load, switching reduced gross margin by $58 million last year. Going forward, we have adjusted our forecast to reflect the current market conditions. Although we do not expect DP&L to be slightly dilutive to earnings this year, excluding one-time noncash transaction charges, we still project $180 million in cash contributions from DP&L in 2012.
Now let me allow -- now allow me to provide some color on our construction pipeline. I am pleased to announce that we have commissioned more than 2000 megawatts of new capacity in 2011. Our 3 largest projects were the 545-megawatt Angamos coal project in Chile, including our 20-megawatt lithium ion battery energy storage system and the 223-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric power plant in Panama, and finally, the 670-megawatt Maritza facility in Bulgaria.
In addition, we completed the 120-megawatt Laurel Mountain wind and energy storage project in the United States, and, in addition, we've had 477 megawatts of gas and solar projects during the year.
AES is now operating 72 megawatts of lithium ion battery as a grid resource, making us a market leader in this innovative use of technology. In 2012, we will have full-year contribution from all of these projects. New capacity is the primary driver of our 21% earnings growth we are expecting for 2012.
Contributing to future growth, we have more than 2300 megawatts of capacity under construction. In 2012, we're expecting to complete 250 megawatts of new wind and solar generation capacity. The 270-megawatt coal fire Campiche project in Chile is ready to come online in 2013 and the 1200-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam is scheduled for completion in late 2015.
It is important to note that we have already fully funded the equity for all of these projects under construction. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Victoria to discuss our 2011 financial performance and the outlook for 2012."
35312,154195645,267194,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 27, 2012",2012-02-27,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free c",1692,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow and parent liquidity; and then finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we met or exceeded our 2011 guidance targets for all key financial metrics. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over 2010 and exceeds our guidance range. Importantly, AES' 2011 proportional free cash flow of $932 million is also at the high end of our range, allowing us to achieve an all-time high for subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion.
Key drivers of this performance are the contributions of several new businesses, which came online in 2011; strong demand and volume growth in Latin America; as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These positive trends offset the expense related to the acquisition of Dayton Power & Light, the impacts of the reserves required for the terror-free sale at Eletropaulo in Brazil, coupled with lower volumes and rates at several of our European businesses. 
As a reminder, as we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we had anticipated that the tariff in Eletropaulo was to be reset in July 2011, impacting the next 4 years. Although the formal tariff notification is still pending, we expect it to be finalized by July 2012, retroactive to July 2011. Given that most of the terms of the tariff have now been determined by the regulator, we've been accruing for the projected impact of these changes since July 2011.
As also previously mentioned last quarter, this cost is approximately $104 million per quarter, resulting in an earnings per share impact of $0.015.
Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers of operating results. There are 3 key operating trends to highlight in our fourth quarter results. 
First, we recorded higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, compared to the same period last year. In particular, at GSA in Brazil, volumes grew 2% due to favorable weather conditions and higher demand at Eletropaulo.
Gener, with 4800 megawatts in operation in Chile and Colombia, also recorded higher electricity volumes due to beneficial weather and hydrological conditions, as well as continued energy demand growth supporting mining activities in the north of Chile.
Second, in Panama, we benefited from higher energy spot prices due to the demand growth of approximately 5% and system supply constraints elsewhere, as well as business interruption insurance proceeds.
Third, our new businesses also added to our strong fourth quarter results. These include the Maritza facility in Bulgaria and the Angamos power plant in Chile, which commenced operations in June and April 2011, respectively. Both of these businesses made first-time contributions to fourth quarter results in 2011, as did DP&L.
Turning to our quarterly earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share declined by $0.02 to $0.23. This was the result of the DP&L expenses incurred prior to closing, with an impact of approximately $0.06, which offset the positive operating trends I just outlined.
Similarly, compared to a year earlier, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.04 to $0.12 for the quarter, driven by positive operating performance in Latin America, but offset by DP&L transaction costs and unrealized foreign currency losses.
Now to address cash flow. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our guidance targets on all of our cash flow metrics for the year. This is a very positive indicator of our healthy and growing operations. However, our cash flows from operations and free cash flow metrics declined from 2010 to 2011 on both a consolidated and proportional basis.
As you may recall, 2010 cash flows benefited from several one-time items, such as $107 million tax credit in Brazil, collection of outstanding receivables from the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil.
In 2011, we did not assume the recurrence of similar one-time benefits, and in fact, in 2011, our cash flows were reduced by some one-time impactors. For example, we had a large one-time tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the sale of our Brazil telecoms business. In addition, the losses incurred in Eastern Energy, a business no longer part of the AES portfolio, reduced our 2011 cash flow year-over-year.
However, neither of these impacts will be ongoing and instead, both reflect positive actions taken within the portfolio as clearly indicated in the $284 million in pre-tax proceeds coming from the Brazil Telecom sale.
Furthermore, our strong operating cash flows are quite apparent in our subsidiary distribution results, as we achieved an all-time high of $1.3 billion in 2011.
Now turning to parent liquidity. As you recall, in the second quarter of 2011, we had issued $2 billion of recourse debt at the parent to finance the acquisition of DP&L, which we closed in November. As a result, we finished the year with $693 million in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we also invested $110 million in construction and development projects, primarily to fund our renewable construction projects.
In summary, 2011 was a strong year with the completion of 2000 megawatts of construction projects, the acquisition of DP&L and $15 million in permanent cost reductions achieved. This puts us well on track to achieve $50 million of savings per year in 2012 due to reduced business development costs and support function efficiency efforts. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a significant earnings growth in 2012.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for 2012. Since we affirmed our 2012 guidance in November, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates have moved. As we typically do each year, we've updated our guidance to reflect changes in the forward curve for both commodities and foreign currencies through the end of the prior reporting period.
Using the forward curves as of the end of December and consistent with the sensitivities we provided in November, the impact to our midpoint of adjusted EPS is a net reduction of approximately $0.06. Since that time, the forward curves have rebounded somewhat. We'll continue to monitor this, as well as all other factors impacting our guidance and update you accordingly.
Thus, our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2012 is now $1.22 to $1.30, with the midpoint of $1.26, primarily reflecting these updated forward curves. The midpoint of $1.26 for this year reflects growth of 21% over the $1.04 we achieved in 2011.
Significant drivers of this will include: in 2011, we incurred $0.13 of acquisition and financing costs related to DP&L prior to its close. The largest driver of year-over-year growth is the contribution of new businesses, primarily Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, in total, adding $0.17 to 2012.
In addition, from our existing businesses, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost reductions of $0.05 mix in 2012. Further, a reduced share count due to our 2011 share buybacks adds $0.02. As an offset to this factor, we have lower rates in 2012, primarily Eletropaulo in Brazil and at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, which will reduce adjusted EPS by $0.06.
We expect the slightly higher tax rate will negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. And we are currently projecting unfavorable foreign currency and commodity price movements of $0.07 versus the rates for full-year 2011.
Keep in mind that our adjusted EPS guidance assumes the extension of TIPRA, tax legislation which impacts some part of the income and an effective tax rate for 2012, which is in line with our tax rate for 2011.
As in prior years, we expect Congress will extend this tax exemption sometime during the year, but it has not been passed as yet. If TIPAR is not extended, the impact to our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance would be approximately $0.12. However, we believe that there may be additional actions we can take to help reduce this drag if necessary.
Also note that only the cash and earnings impacts of closed asset sales, including Brazil Telecom, the Bohemia plant in the Czech Republic, the Argentine distribution companies and Cartagena in Spain are incorporated in our 2012 guidance at this point in the year.
For example, the impacts of the pending Red Oak and Ironwood sales are not yet included and will not be until they close. We believe the adjusted EPS impacts of these transactions are limited, as a result of the attractive valuations we expect to achieve. However, as we progress further in our asset-sale program, we may experience some near-term dilution in our earnings until we can redeploy the proceeds. As a result of all of these factors, our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint is now $1.26. 
Similar to adjusted earnings per share, cash flow trends are projected to be very strong in 2012. Driven primarily by the contributions of our new businesses, we're expecting a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion proportional free cash flow. Our guidance midpoint for this metric represents an increase of 23% over 2011 results. With respect to subsidiary distributions, we're projecting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on the midpoint, we're expecting to achieve an increase of 7% in subsidiary distributions over our record-high levels produced in 2011.
Turning now to our 2012 near-term capital allocation plan. Over the course of 2012, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of organic parent free cash flow. This will be used to fund dividends, growth investments, share repurchases and parent debt repayments, based on the return price profile of opportunities available.
In addition, we expect to receive $460 million or more of asset-sale proceeds over the course of 2012. Much of this cash is expected to be received in the second half of the year. The cash will be allocated in the total return framework for 2015, as Andres discussed.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

But when we see that we can't have that, we will sell. So take the 2 gas plants that we sold in the U.S., those are plants that were contracted for a long time and we really felt that we could better redeploy that cash and increase our shareholders' reserves. So that's sort of the view. I mean, if you look at the sale of the telecoms in Brazil, we really thought that the market had peaked. If we wanted to stay in that market, it would require very significant investments. That's not one of our -- telecoms is not a core market for us. So we will sell out. The long-term view is to simplify our portfolio and that also feeds into our cost reduction targets here in terms of corporate overhead and cost of goods sold.

So that continues to go well. We have some exposures there because we have PPAs that are recovering as Hydro plant and spot pricing was relatively high during the outage. But through business interruption insurance and negotiations, with the supportive Panamanian government, we’ve managed to eliminate most of that exposure. So it's been relatively smooth to date. There's actually been some issues in Panama regarding indigenous protests, which has to do with certain legislation that President Martinelli has been moving forward, but it hasn't impacted our operations so as, again, we continue to believe we'll have that plant back in commercial operations by early second quarter of 2012."

What we've basically done -- I think, traditionally, we've been compensated on the basis of NPV created on new projects. And what we are changing is to not only have the NPV created, but what is the capital efficiency. So it's not the same to produce $100 million of NPV if it's going to require $300 million of corp equity in, as it's 0, right? So basically, the idea is to try to favor and get people more motivated to see ways that we can create NPV without requiring AES equity. And we think that's the way we're really going to improve our return on invested capital. Our return of invested capital in the last -- in the short term, we've had a number of impairments, and the like, in 8% to 9% range. I think we can do substantially better over time. This is not something -- this is -- we have a lot of assets, it's going to take a while to move it. But we think with this new focus -- what does that mean? That means, for example, if you have $1 billion of leverage capacity at Chiate [ph] that is a key way of improving returns to AES. It doesn't require any money. If you have, essentially, cash in India with our partner or the state of Orissa, which is not being utilized in OPGC, you've got to utilize it there. So you're absolutely right. We really haven't had a sort of -- say, what was going to go from, say, 9% to 12%, but we will be looking at this and seeing how fast we can change that. And just wanted to sort of complement. One area where we haven't -- we're looking at is, for example, what can we do with our renewables portfolio in the sense that we have about $1,250,000,000 invested, are there ways that we can unleash some of that value there, too?"

Since our last earnings call in February, we have continued to meet with many of our investors as we visited Baltimore, New York and London. We had some great",1893,"Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. Since our last earnings call in February, we have continued to meet with many of our investors as we visited Baltimore, New York and London. We had some great meetings, and I appreciate the direct feedback on our plans and strategy.
Today, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we've made since our fourth quarter call. First, we're off to a good start with our first quarter results. And despite some headwinds, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Second, we're encouraged with the progress we are making at DP&L, including their market rate option I think and the likelihood of reaching a constructive outcome in a timely manner. Third, we have closed 2 more asset sales, Red Oak and Ironwood, for a total of $227 million in proceeds to AES. We have also signed an agreement to sell our interest in 379 megawatts of hydro assets in China, subject to customary approvals. This represents additional equity proceeds of approximately $48 million. And fourth, we remain committed to using our balanced approach to capital allocation in order to deliver on our 2013 to 2015 total return goals. To that end, we have increased our current share repurchase authorization to $180 million so we now have authorization of $302 million. 
Now turning to our first quarter 2012 financial results. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported $0.37 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, a 54% increase over the first quarter of last year.
Similarly, our proportional free cash flow grew 51% during the first quarter. Victoria will discus the drivers of our performance in more detail, but I am pleased with our results, which puts in a strong position for the year.
We delivered this healthy performance despite having had an extremely mild winter in the U.S., one of our most in recent history, which affected us doubly through low natural gas and energy prices, as well as lower demand.
The second topic I'd like to address is DP&L. During the first quarter, we continued with our plans to integrate DP&L with the rest of AES' portfolio. We named the new President of CEO of DP&L, Bill Harrington. Bill has more than 20 years of industry experience, which includes managing a competitive power business. His experience and skill are well suited for today's dynamic Ohio marketplace.
At DP&L, our focus is threefold: Obtaining a constructive outcome in the rate proceedings for 2013, executing on our refill strategy and achieving operating efficiencies as a business.
As you may recall, DP&L's current generation rate expire in December of 2012. To establish the tariff for 2013 and beyond, DP&L filed a market rate option or MRO with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio at the end of March. Under the proposed terms of the MRO, DP&L transition customers to market prices for generation over the next 5 years. We are working closely with the Ohio commission, customers and other interested parties to arrive at a constructive outcome for all stakeholders in a timely manner.
The stats comments were issued last Friday, and they were very productive. We are where we expected to be at this stage of the process.
The team at DP&L is also focused on enhancing their retail capabilities. Customer switching trends at DP&L for the first quarter of 2012 were in line with our guidance for the year as 3% of the load switch during the quarter. As of the end of March, 53% of the total retail load had switched to ultimate suppliers, but DP&L's retail arm was able to capture 78% of those switch load.
So reduction in DP&L's gross margin in the quarter as a result of customer switching is approximately $27 million, up $18 million from the first quarter of 2011.
DP&L's retail arm is now not only aggressively working to retain customers in its service territory but is also branching out to attracting customers in Illinois and other areas of Ohio. DP&L's retail subsidiary, MC squared, recently won a competitive bid auction to supply several Illinois communities with electricity for up to 3 years.
We are also taking careful look at ways to improve our operating margins at DP&L and our North American portfolio in general. Due to current low natural gas prices, the near-term outlook for DP&L is challenging and, admittedly, disappointing relative to our expectations at the time we announce the acquisition. However, forecast for DP&L are still within our guidance range for this year and consistent with our earnings growth rate targets for 2013 to 2015.
Thirdly, I'd like to update you on our asset sales program. We continue to make good progress on narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling select, nonstrategic businesses. Since our last call, we closed the sales of our Ironwood and Red Oak plants for a total of $227 million. 
In addition, today we announced that we signed an agreement to sell 100% of our interest in the 379-megawatt small Hydro asset in China. On a proportional basis, we will sell 72 megawatts. Proceeds are expected to be approximately $48 million, and we believe this transaction will close in the second half of 2012.
Including the transaction announced today, we have closed and signed asset sales totaling $804 million, about 40% of the potential $2 billion universe of nonstrategic assets that could be sold. The average P/E multiple realized on the sales was more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. These sales have also led to the deconsolidation of $1.7 billion of nonrecourse debt from our balance sheet.
Finally, as we laid out in our fourth quarter earnings call, we're executing a balanced approach to capital allocation, which aims to balance strong total shareholder returns with profitable growth.
Now let me review the primary sources of available cash that we will allocate this year. In addition to our asset-sale proceeds, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of parent free cash flow. This will bring our total net discretionary cash for the year to approximately $1.3 billion.
Now let me lay out how we plan to use our available cash. We intend to use approximately 2/3 or $920 million to delever the company and to buy back stock. Today, we have already paid down $197 million of expenses nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and we have used another $285 million to repay borrowings on our corporate revolver, which we do to fund the acquisition of DP&L.
As I mentioned previously, our Board of Directors has increased the outstanding authorization for share buybacks from $122 million to $302 million. We have not repurchased any shares since the fourth quarter of 2011 because we used our liquidity to fund the acquisition of DP&L and then in the first quarter, to pay down associated borrowings under the revolver.
Nonetheless, at current prices, we see share buybacks as a value accretive investment. In addition, starting in Q4, we will be paying a $30 million quarterly dividend.
With the respect to the remaining 1/3 of our discretionary free cash or approximately $360 million, we intend to utilize some to grow our portfolio or to further invest in our balance sheet. Before making any final determination, we will apply the capital allocation framework we discussed in our last call with the goal of maximizing risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders. To that end, we will provide you with an update on our capital allocation plan as we make progress on asset sales and realize the free cash flow being generated by our existing businesses.
Now let me provide you with an update on our development projects. We are only proceeding with those projects that meet our investment criteria in markets where we believe we have a compelling, competitive advantage. We are giving preference to those projects that expand upon existing platforms and use full local liquidity either debt or cash. Our goal is to significantly improve on our overall capital efficiency and return on invested capital.
In Chile, we are making good progress on our 2 most advanced development projects, Cochrane and Alto Maipo. Cochrane is a 532-megawatt coal-fired plant adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos project in the northern grid; and Alto Maipo is a 531-megawatt run of the river Hydro plant near the load center in Santiago.
Alto Maipo is an expansion of our existing 209 Alfalfal run of the river Hydro facility. We have already received a number of critical milestones on both projects, including securing the necessary environmental permits. We are currently working on the our offtake agreement, construction contract and finance.
Given our large position in Chile, we expect the equity needs of the 2 projects to be a supply to the local Chilean market or free cash being generated at the level. 
We're also making good progress in the Philippines, where we had 630-megawatt coal-fired expansion project adjacent to our existing 660-megawatt Masinloc facility. Recently, the Philippine government approved this project for various investment incentives, such as an income tax holiday. The project team is now focused on offtake agreement, EPC contract and nonrecourse financing with a view to close in 2013.
In India, where we have test in our joint venture with the state government of Orissa, we are making progress in deploying that cash toward a tripling of capacity at our OPGC facility. Our initial equity contributions to the platform expansions in India and the Philippines are unlikely to occur before 2013, as the projects can self-fund early stage development activities.
In addition to these platform expansion projects, we're making steady progress on building on our wind development pipeline in Poland and the U.K. and the development of 2 thermal projects. One in Columbia, via 1000-megawatt Hydro old by AES Gener, and one in Turkey, via our joint venture. We're also moving forward with smaller but highly profitable platform expansions like a 20-megawatt lithium ion battery facility slated to the Angamos facility in Chile, a 20-megawatt expansion of our Hydro plant in Columbia, and closing our open cycle gas plant in the Dominican Republic. We expect our equity investments in all of these projects in 2012 to be modest. 
Our larger construction projects are also progressing well. In Chile, we expect the 270-megawatt coal-fired plant to be commissioned in early 2013. And in Vietnam, our 1200 megawatt coal-fired loan remains on track for commissioning in 2015.
Overall, I am pleased with the growth prospects that we have across our portfolio. We have not seen any negative effects from our reduction and business development expenditures. Our greater focus on platform expansions has lowered development cost in yielding projects with higher average returns and greater capital efficiency, which we define as net present value over AES equity investment.
Even so, in all cases, the value created by development projects must be the value creation opportunity we have to share buybacks and debt repayment. 
As I mentioned in the last quarterly call, we will implement our capital allocation framework with the goal of achieving an average 3-year total return of 8% to 10% from 2013 through 2015.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Victoria to discuss our strong results in the first quarter in greater detail."
35312,183752767,297572,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 04, 2012",2012-05-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following topics: Our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.",1356,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following topics: Our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
First, let's review our financial results for the quarter. Our proportional gross margin increased by $172 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by the contributions of our new businesses, including Daton Power & Light in U.S., Orissa in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, as well as strong volume growth in Latin America.
In addition, gross margin benefited from settlement of several prior period claims that Cartagena in Spain. These disputes were results earlier this quarter, allowing us to record a proportional pre-tax benefit of approximately $67 million.
However, we also experienced some headwinds during the quarter. At AES Gener, lower spot pricing reduced margins in the Northern part of Chile. This is a significant trend we're experiencing this year, which I will cover in more detail when I discuss our full year 2012 guidance expectations.
Beyond this, as many of you know, the tariff reset process for Eletropaulo in Brazil is still Dell underway. However, on April 19, the regulator there issued a preliminary tariff proposal, which is lower than previously expected. To reflect our updated projections of the tariff reset outcome on AES, we increased our pretax regulatory liability to a $162 million for the quarter, which includes a catch-up liability of $29 million for the second half of 2011.
Relative to our previous expectations, this equates to an incremental ongoing $5 million impact of proportional gross margin per quarter as AES owns 16% of Eletropaulo.
Diluted earnings per share. First quarter results decreased by $0.13 to $0.37. The new businesses contributed $0.06 during the quarter and higher volumes in Latin America added $0.05. Lower prices primarily related to the tariff reset expectation in Eletropaulo in Brazil and spot prices in Chile reduced earnings per share by $0.04.
Beyond this, outages at our plants in Northern Ireland and Panama impacted the quarter by $0.02. Repairs in those locations are nearing completion and most of those plants will be back online later this quarter. In addition, our plant in Panama is also scheduled to the back online early in the second half of 2012.
Finally, the settlement in Cartagena added $0.06 for the quarter. In total, the trends affecting gross margin added $0.11. Lower G&A cost and other factors contributed $0.02 in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
When compared to a year earlier, diluted or gap earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.14 to $0.44 for the quarter, driven by an increase in gross margin and a gain on the sale of Cartagena, but also the impairment losses, which were excluded from adjusted earnings per share.
Now turning to cash flow. This same operating trends also drove our cash flow performance for the quarter. We recorded year-over-year gains on both a consolidated and a proportional basis. 
On a consolidated basis, our net cash from operating activities increased 6% year-over-year. Our proportional free cash flow increased 51% to $235 million for the quarter. These positive cash flow trends also benefited parent liquidity during the quarter. And not only did we generate $229 million from the close of the sale of our business in Cartagena and Spain, but we also realized $176 million in subsidiary distributions from ongoing operations.
Finally, as Andres mentioned, we repaid $285 million of borrowings under our corporate revolver that have been previously drawn during our acquisition of DP&L in late 2011. As a result, we ended the first quarter with more than $900 million of parent liquidity, up from $693 million at year-end 2011, significantly strengthening the parent balance sheet.
In summary, we report the strong quarter, approximate financial metrics. Further, we're on track with our cost-cutting initiatives as we expect to achieve $50 million of savings in 2012 and cumulative cost savings of $100 million by the end of 2013. With all of these levers in hand, we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments in 2012 and beyond.
Now let me give you an update on our 2012 guidance. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share and all cash flow metrics based on the trends we currently see.
However, we are lowering U.S. gap earnings per share guidance at this time from a range of $1.28 to $1.36 to $1.22 to $1.30, reflecting the $0.06 of noncash impairment reported during the quarter.
Now let me discuss trends impacting our guidance metrics in greater detail. Since our last call, there have been both positive and negative developments that have had an impact on our 2012 forecast.
Starting with our earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, relative to our budget, we experienced the decline in spot market pricing in Chile during the quarter. Lower spot prices in northern Chile were primarily driven by the temporary market pricing impact of fuel supply dynamics competitive plants. AES Gener exposure to lower spot prices and that eventually reduced adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
However, in June, contracted capacity at AES Gener's Angamos facility will increase from 65% to 90%, so the exposure to this market pricing factor will be reduced during the second half of the year.
In addition, the Eletropaulo tariff reset is still pending, and it's expected to be finalized by June of this year. Relative to our previous 2012 guidance, we now have to absorb a $0.02 reduction in adjusted earnings per share consistent with our Q1 regulatory liability accrual. We will, of course, update you once this important tariff change is finalize.
Another factor affecting our 2012 operational outlook as a loss of earnings from the Red Oak and Ironwood plans and due to their sale, which is approximately $0.01. As these asset sales are now closed, we have reflected the full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range.
On the positive side, since December 2011, foreign exchange and commodity price forward curves have moved in our favor. We've updated our guidance to reflect the forward curves as of March 31 2012. This resulted in a positive impact of $0.06 in adjusted earnings per share.
Finally, we're projecting a $0.01 benefit from investing our discretionary cash in planned debt paydown and share repurchases in the second half of 2012. Further, as previously noted on our last call, our adjusted earnings per share guidance assumes the extension of the U.S. income tax deferral benefits originally enacted under TIPRA. This is reflected in an effective tax rate for 2012, which remains generally in line with our 29% tax rate for 2011.
As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year, but it has not as yet been passed. As a result, would've been hard at work this quarter to developing tax mitigation strategies to reduce the full year estimated earnings impact from approximately $0.12 to $0.02 to $0.03 this year, should TIPRA not be extended before year end. Recall that this is a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion.
Considering all of these factors, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for 2012. 
In terms of our cash flow guidance, we expect 2012 to come in near the lower end of our range for both consolidated and proportional measures. This is largely due to higher working capital requirements in Brazil, higher environment CapEx anticipated at AES Gener, as well as the loss of cash flow from asset sales.
Note that our current guidance includes only the impacts of assets sale that a closed as of April 2012, including Red Oak and Ironwood. We have not yet included the impact of our China assets sale in our guidance, but we expect it to be minimal at this business was not expected to be a significant contributor to our 2012 financials.
With that, let me the call back over to Andres."

My view is that Within the next 2 years, we'll make substantial progress on that. As Andres had said, the approach of DP&L is three-pronged and they're almost serious. First, we have to do is get the case completed that we have clarity in a lot of issues. At the same time, the next thing is to really continue to drive on the regulatory strategy to make a lot of changes. Bill Harrington is a very important step for us with his competitive experience. We've integrated MC squared into the retail function of the DP&L. We're doing a lot of operational of the businesses. And that will really leave us to such really drive cost for 2 reasons.

It's the right next door that probably have the same equipment then maybe contractor, similar offtake agreement with the mining company, one or more. So just thinking of the repetition of Angamos. In terms of the NPV created, for example, in Angamos, to give you an idea, again, I can't give you an exact number, we have target for Cochrane that we PPAs and Cochrane. But the NPV created at Angamos was about $300 million. And we're also expanding on the Angamos facility by putting 20-megawatt battery at the NIM environment battery facility there. Alto Maipo would be a very profitable project. Is a large project even though it's one of the River, there's a lot of construction involved. So that would -- if we are starting now, this is a project, which would come onstream around '15,' 16. And so those are the 3 main projects. I think when you look at them from -- the other one, of course, is Masinloc. We -- so let me go back other bit. So thinking about the Genaro projects, you're talking about probably equity needs of around $400 million over the next 3 years, and that would come from locally through cash flow and other means. And then if we look at Masinloc, Masinloc has sent had the same sort of support, which we're basically looking at 630-megawatt expansion of the existing current Masinloc facility. So you're probably talking about maybe half that amount, about $200 million. And that's a little bit less advanced than the 2 projects are in Chile."

We had a high rate. Not significantly high, were still pretty good. What you see is 2 things. One is you've seen different positive customer and on the competition is fully over with a special customers coming in due to market through aggregation or sort of one-off knocking the door and getting customer. The competition is increasing so that's why wasn't up slightly in the recapture. So our overall capture rate, if you work up the numbers the has given us, is about they 87% in DP&L, which is critically important because having that brand affiliation, you will help us with being able to place the generation going forward. So that's was very important to actually catch your customers. I think one of the issues and aggregation we've seen here is that, that's going as we expected. There's been a slowdown in the aggregation rate, meaning that actions have an happen as quickly as we can but we still think aggregation move as we plan and as we expect.

Since our last earnings call in February, we have continued to meet with many of our investors as we visited Baltimore, New York and London. We had some great meetings, and I appreciate the direct feedback on our plans and strategy.
Today, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we've made since our fourth quarter call. First, we're off to a good start with our first quarter results. And despite some headwinds, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Second, we're encouraged with the progress we are making at DP&L, including their market rate option filing and the likelihood of reaching a constructive outcome in a timely manner. Third, we have closed 2 more asset sales, Red Oak and Ironwood, for a total of $227 million in proceeds to AES. We have also signed an agreement to sell our interest in 379 megawatts of hydro assets in China subject to customary approvals. This represents additional equity proceeds of approximately $48 million. And fourth, we remain committed to using a balanced approach to capital allocation in order to deliver on our 2013 to 2015 total return goals. To that end, we have increased our current share repurchase authorization to $180 million, so we now have authorization of $302 million. 
Now turning to our first quarter 2012 financial results. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported $0.37 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, a 54% increase over the first quarter of last year. Similarly, our proportional free cash flow grew 51% during the first quarter. Victoria will discuss the drivers of our performance in more detail, but I am pleased with our results, which puts us in a strong position for the year. We delivered this healthy performance despite having had an extremely mild winter in the U.S., one of the warmest in recent history, which affected us doubly through low natural gas and energy prices, as well as lower demand.
The second topic I'd like to address is DP&L. During the first quarter, we continued with our plans to integrate DP&L with the rest of AES' portfolio. We named the new President and CEO of DP&L, Phil Harrington. Phil has more than 20 years of industry experience, which includes managing a competitive power business. His experience and skills are well suited for today's dynamic Ohio marketplace.
At DP&L, our focus is threefold: Obtaining a constructive outcome in the rate proceedings for 2013, executing on our retail strategy and achieving operating efficiencies as a business.
As you may recall, DP&L's current generation rate expired in December of 2012. To establish the tariff for 2013 and beyond, DP&L filed a market rate option or MRO with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio at the end of March. Under the proposed terms of the MRO, DP&L will transition customers to market prices for generation over the next 5 years. We are working closely with the Ohio commission, customers and other interested parties to arrive at a constructive outcome for all stakeholders in a timely manner.
The staff's comments were issued last Friday, and they were very productive. We are where we expected to be at this stage of the process.
The team at DP&L is also focused on enhancing their retail capabilities. Customer switching trends at DP&L for the first quarter of 2012 were in line with our guidance for the year as 3% of the load switch during the quarter. As of the end of March, 53% of the total retail load had switched to ultimate suppliers, but DP&L's retail arm was able to capture 78% of those switched load. The reduction in DP&L's gross margin in the quarter as a result of customer switching is approximately $27 million, up $18 million from the first quarter of 2011. DP&L's retail arm is now not only aggressively working to retain customers in its service territory but it is also branching out to attract new customers in Illinois and other areas of Ohio. DP&L's retail subsidiary, MC Squared, recently won a competitive bid auction to supply several North Shore, Illinois communities with electricity for up to 3 years.
We are also taking a careful look at ways to improve our operating margins at DP&L and our North American portfolio in general. Due to current low natural gas prices, the near-term outlook for DP&L is challenging and admittedly disappointing relative to our expectations at the time we announced the acquisition. However, forecast for DP&L are still within our guidance range for this year and consistent with our earnings growth rate targets for 2013 to 2015.
Thirdly, I'd like to update you on our asset sales program. We continue to make good progress on narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling select, nonstrategic businesses. Since our last call, we closed the sales of our Ironwood and Red Oak plants for a total of $227 million. In addition, today, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell 100% of our interest in the 379-megawatt small hydro assets in China. On a proportional basis, we will sell 72 megawatts. Proceeds are expected to be approximately $48 million, and we believe this transaction will close in the second half of 2012. Including the transaction announced today, we have closed and signed asset sales totaling $804 million, about 40% of the potential $2 billion universe of nonstrategic assets that could be sold. The average P/E multiple realized on these sales was more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. These sales have also led to the deconsolidation of $1.7 billion of non-recourse debt from our balance sheet.
Finally, as we laid out in our fourth quarter earnings call, we're executing a balanced approach to capital allocation, which aims to balance strong total shareholder returns with profitable growth.
Now let me review the primary sources of available cash that we will allocate this year. In addition to our asset-sale proceeds, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of parent free cash flow. This will bring our total net discretionary cash for the year to approximately $1.3 billion.
Now let me lay out how we plan to use our available cash. We intend to use approximately 2/3 or $920 million to delever the company and buy back stock. To date, we have already paid down $197 million of expensive non-recourse debt in Brazil, and we have used another $285 million to repay borrowings on our corporate revolver, which we drew on to fund the acquisition of DP&L. As I mentioned previously, our Board of Directors has increased the outstanding authorization for share buybacks from $122 million to $302 million. We have not repurchased any shares since the fourth quarter of 2011 because we used our liquidity to fund the acquisition of DP&L and then, in the first quarter, to pay down associated borrowings under the revolver. Nonetheless, at current prices, we see share buybacks as a value accretive investment. In addition, starting in Q4, we will be paying a $30 million quarterly dividend. With respect to the remaining 1/3 of our discretionary free cash or approximately $360 million, we intend to utilize the sum to grow our portfolio or to further invest in our balance sheet. 
Before making any final determination, we will apply the capital allocation framework we discussed in our last call with the goal of maximizing risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders. To that end, we will provide you with an update on our capital allocation plan as we make progress on asset sales and realize the free cash flow being generated by our existing businesses.
Now let me provide you with an update on our development projects. We are only proceeding with those projects that meet our investment criteria in markets where we believe we have a compelling, competitive advantage. We are giving preference to those projects that expand upon existing platforms and use pools of local liquidity, either debt or cash. Our goal is to significantly improve on our overall capital efficiency and return on invested capital.
In Chile, we are making good progress on our 2 most advanced development projects, Cochrane and Alto Maipo. Cochrane is a 532-megawatt coal-fired plant adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos project in the northern grid. And Alto Maipo is a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant near the load center in Santiago. Alto Maipo is an expansion of our existing 209 Alfalfal run of the river hydro facility. We have already received a number of critical milestones on both projects, including securing the necessary environmental permits. We are currently working on the power offtake agreement, construction contracts and financing. Given our large position in Chile, we expect the equity needs of the 2 projects to be -- or supplied through the local Chilean market or through cash being generated at the AES Gener level. 
We're also making good progress in the Philippines, where we had a 630-megawatt coal-fired expansion project adjacent to our existing 660-megawatt Masinloc facility. Recently, the Philippine government approved this project for various investment incentives, such as an income tax holiday. The project team is now focused on offtake agreement, EPC contracts and non-recourse financing with the view to close in 2013.
In India, where we have trap test [ph] in our joint venture with the state government of Orissa, we are making progress in deploying that cash towards a tripling of capacity at our OPGC facility. 
Our initial equity contributions to the platform expansions in India and the Philippines are unlikely to occur before 2013 as the projects can self-fund early stage development activities.
In addition to these platform expansion projects, we're making steady progress on building on our wind development pipeline in Poland and the U.K. and the development of 2 thermal projects, one in Colombia via Chivor, a 1000-megawatt hydro owned by AES Gener, and one in Turkey via our joint venture with  Koç. We're also moving forward with smaller but highly profitable platform expansions, like a 20-megawatt lithium ion battery facility related to the Angamos facility in Chile, to Inhita [ph], a 20-megawatt expansion of our hydro plant at Chivor in Colombia, and closing our open cycle Los Mina gas plant in the Dominican Republic. We expect our equity investments in all of these projects in 2012 to be modest. 
Our larger construction projects are also progressing well. In Chile, we expect the 270-megawatt coal-fired Campiche plant to be commissioned in early 2013. And in Vietnam, our 1,200-megawatt coal-fired Mong Duong plant remains on track for commissioning in 2015.
Overall, I am pleased with the growth prospects that we have across our portfolio. We have not seen any negative effects from our reduction in business development expenditures. Our greater focus on platform expansions has lowered development cost and is yielding projects with higher average returns and greater capital efficiency, which we define as net present value over AES equity investment. Even so, in all cases, the value created by development projects must beat the value creation opportunity we have through share buybacks and debt repayment. As I mentioned on the last quarterly call, we will implement our capital allocation framework with the goal of achieving an average 3-year total return of 8% to 10% from 2013 through 2015.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Victoria to discuss our strong results in the first quarter in greater detail."

Today, I'll cover the following topics: our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.",1365,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following topics: our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
First, let's review our financial results for the quarter. Our proportional gross margin increased by $172 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by the contributions of our new businesses, including Dayton Power & Light in the U.S., Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, as well as strong volume growth in Latin America. In addition, gross margin benefited from settlement of several prior period claims at Cartagena in Spain. These disputes were resolved earlier this quarter, allowing us to record a proportional pretax benefit of approximately $67 million.
However, we also experienced some headwinds during the quarter. At AES Gener, lower spot pricing reduced margins in the SING in the Northern part of Chile. This is a significant trend we're experiencing this year, which I will cover in more detail when I discuss our full year 2012 guidance expectations. Beyond this, as many of you know, the tariff reset process for Eletropaulo in Brazil is still underway. However, on April 19, the regulator there issued a preliminary tariff proposal, which is lower than previously expected.
To reflect our updated projections of the tariff reset outcome on AES, we increased our pretax regulatory liability to $162 million for the quarter, which includes a catch-up liability of $29 million for the second half of 2011. Relative to our previous expectations, this equates to an incremental ongoing $5 million impact to proportional gross margin per quarter as AES owns 16% of Eletropaulo.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. First quarter results increased by $0.13 to $0.37. The new businesses contributed $0.06 during the quarter, and higher volumes in Latin America added $0.05. Lower prices primarily related to the tariff reset expectation in Eletropaulo in Brazil and spot prices in Chile reduced earnings per share by $0.04. Beyond this, outages at our plants in Northern Ireland and Panama impacted the quarter by $0.02. Repairs in those locations are nearing completion, and most of those plants will be back online later this quarter. In addition, our Esti plant in Panama is also scheduled to the back online early in the second half of 2012. Finally, the settlement at Cartagena added $0.06 for the quarter. In total, the trends affecting gross margin added $0.11. Lower G&A cost and other factors contributed $0.02 in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. When compared to a year earlier, diluted or GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.14 to $0.44 for the quarter, driven by an increase in gross margin and a gain on the sale of Cartagena, but offset by impairment losses, which are excluded from adjusted earnings per share.
Now turning to cash flow. The same operating trends also drove our cash flow performance for the quarter. We recorded year-over-year gains on both a consolidated and a proportional basis. On a consolidated basis, our net cash from operating activities increased 6% year-over-year. Our proportional free cash flow increased 51% to $235 million for the quarter. 
These positive cash flow trends also benefited parent liquidity during the quarter. Not only did we generate $229 million from the close of the sale of our business in Cartagena in Spain, but we also realized $176 million in subsidiary distributions from ongoing operation. Finally, as Andres mentioned, we repaid $285 million of borrowings under our corporate revolver that have been previously drawn during our acquisition of DP&L in late 2011. As a result, we ended the first quarter with more than $900 million of parent liquidity, up from $693 million at year end 2011, significantly strengthening the parent balance sheet.
In summary, we report a strong quarter across most financial metrics. Further, we're on track with our cost-cutting initiatives as we expect to achieve $50 million of savings in 2012 and cumulative cost savings of $100 million by the end of 2013. With all of these levers in hand, we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments in 2012 and beyond.
Now let me give you an update on our 2012 guidance. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share and all cash flow metrics based on the trends we currently see. However, we are lowering U.S. GAAP earnings per share guidance at this time from a range of $1.28 to $1.36 to $1.22 to $1.30, reflecting the $0.06 of noncash impairment recorded during the quarter.
Now let me discuss trends impacting our guidance metrics in greater detail. Since our last call, there have been both positive and negative developments that have had an impact on our 2012 forecast.
Starting with our earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, relative to our budget, we experienced a decline in spot market pricing in Chile during the quarter. Lower spot prices in Northern Chile were primarily driven by the temporary market pricing impacts of fuel supply dynamics at competitor plants. AES Gener's exposure to lower spot prices in Northern Chile reduced adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.04. However, in June, contracted capacity at AES Gener's new Angamos facility will increase from 65% to 90%. So the exposure to this market pricing factor will be reduced during the second half of the year. 
In addition, the Eletropaulo tariff reset is still pending, and it's expected to be finalized by June of this year. Relative to our previous 2012 guidance, we now have to absorb a $0.02 reduction in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our Q1 regulatory liability accrual. We will, of course, update you once this important tariff change is finalized.
Another factor affecting our 2012 operational outlook is the loss of earnings from the Red Oak and Ironwood plans due to their sale, which is approximately $0.01. As these asset sales are now closed, we have reflected this in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range.
On a positive side, since December 2011, foreign exchange and commodity price forward curves have moved in our favor. We've updated our guidance to reflect the forward curves as of March 31, 2012. This resulted in a positive impact of $0.06 in adjusted earnings per share. Finally, we're projecting a $0.01 benefit from investing our discretionary cash in planned debt paydown and share repurchases in the second half of 2012. 
Further, as previously noted on our last call, our adjusted earnings per share guidance assumes the extension of the U.S. income tax deferral benefits originally enacted under TIPRA. This is reflected in an effective tax rate for 2012, which remains generally in line with our 29% tax rate for 2011. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year, but it has not as yet been passed. As a result, we've been hard at work this quarter developing tax mitigation strategies to reduce the full year estimated earnings impact from approximately $0.12 to $0.02 to $0.03 this year should TIPRA not be extended before year end. Recall that this is a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion.
Considering all of these factors, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for 2012. 
In terms of our cash flow guidance, we expect 2012 to come in near the lower end of our range for both consolidated and proportional measures. This is largely due to higher working capital requirements in Brazil, higher environmental CapEx anticipated at AES Gener, as well as the loss of cash flow from asset sales.
Note that our current guidance includes only the impacts of asset sales that have closed as of April 2012, including Red Oak and Ironwood. We have not yet included the impact of our China asset sale in our guidance, but we expect it to be minimal as this business was not expected to be a significant contributor to our 2012 financials.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

It lines with the statutes in Ohio and advances the public policy to its competition. And for us, it really protects the financial integrity of the company and, importantly, allows us to emerge in this transition period as a viable competitor in the market. That said, the staff comments basically had indicated that they believe we could get all those outcomes with an ESP and, in fact, advised that we consider. And I think with origin [ph] their comments were strongly advised that we consider it because it had more advantages to us. But we're entering the technical conference -- the pre-conference hearings next week. You've had a very open engagement with interveners and with staff. I think our view is that there's enough commonality of interest that settlement is a possibility. And my sense is that as we move towards the evidentiary hearing in June, probably the best time to find some common ground. So we are open to the comments. We're open to proposals. Our view is that if we were to consider moving forward from an MRO to an ESP, we would only do so if it gave us the same benefits as the MRO does. And if the staff is correct that there are greater advantages, we surely would consider heading down the road of a settlement. And our view is that the settlement could be done in a timely way within the schedule laid out by the commission. So I think that's the way we're seeing it."

My view is that within the next 2 years, we'll make substantial progress on that. As Andres had said, the approach at DP&L is 3-pronged and they're almost in series. The first thing we have to do is we have to get the case completed. We have clarity in a lot of the issues. At the same time, the next thing is to really continue to drive on the regulatory strategy. We've made a lot of changes. Adding Phil Harrington is a very important step for us with his competitive experience. We've integrated MC Squared into the retail function broadly at DP&L. We're doing a lot of operational sharing between our other businesses. And that will lead us then to such really drive cost out for 2 reasons: One is because I think across the business, we should do that. We have the capability at AES to do that.

In terms of the NPV created, for example, at Angamos, to give you an idea -- and again, I can't give you an exact number, we have target for Cochrane, not until we send all the PPAs and finalize the contract, but the NPV created at Angamos was about $300 million. And we're also expanding on the Angamos facility by putting a 20-megawatt battery, lithium ion battery facility there. Alto Maipo would be a very profitable project. It's a large project. It has a -- even though it's run of the river, there's a lot of construction involved. So that would -- if we -- starting now, this is a project which would come onstream around '15, '16. And so those are the 3 main projects. I think when you look at them from a -- so the other one, of course, is Masinloc 2. We -- so let me go back a little bit. So thinking of the 2 Gener projects, you're talking about probably equity needs of around $400 million over the next 3 years and that would come from -- locally through Gener's cash flow and other means. And then if we look at Masinloc, Masinloc does not have the same sort of support, which we're basically looking at a 630-megawatt expansion of the existing, current Masinloc facility. So you're probably talking about -- maybe half that amount, about $200 million. And that's a little bit less advanced than the 2 projects that are in Chile."

You're right, when we think about it, what you're dealing with now is residential customers. And looking at a large commercial, industrial customers initially, we had a higher capture rate because we had a much tighter relationship they where in franchise. We had relationships ongoing. We had a high rate, not significantly high. We're still pretty good. So what you see is 2 things: One, you're seeing different classes of customers now. And now the competition is fully over at residential customers and they're coming either into markets or aggregation or sort of one-off door -- knocking on the door and getting an opt-in customer. The competition is increasing, so that's why the numbers have dropped slightly in the recapture. So our overall capture rate, if you work off the numbers that Andres has given us, is about 87% still affiliated with the DP&L brand, which is critically important because having that brand affiliation will help us with being able to place that generation going forward. So that's why it's very important for us to actually capture customers. I think one of the issues of aggregation, what we've seen here, is that it's going as we expected. There's been a little slowdown in the aggregation rate, meaning that actions haven't happened as quickly as we can, but we still think aggregation will move as we plan and as we expect. So that's -- it's pretty much playing out the way we're seeing it."

Since our last earnings call in February, we have continued to meet with many of our investors as we visited Baltimore, New York and London. We had some great meetings, and I appreciate the direct feedback on our plans and strategy.
Today, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we've made since our fourth quarter call. First, we're off to a good start with our first quarter results. And despite some headwinds, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Second, we're encouraged with the progress we are making at DP&L, including their market rate option filing and the likelihood of reaching a constructive outcome in a timely manner. Third, we have closed 2 more asset sales, Red Oak and Ironwood, for a total of $227 million in proceeds to AES. We have also signed an agreement to sell our interest in 379 megawatts of hydro assets in China subject to customary approvals. This represents additional equity proceeds of approximately $48 million. And fourth, we remain committed to using a balanced approach to capital allocation in order to deliver on our 2013 to 2015 total return goals. To that end, we have increased our current share repurchase authorization by $180 million, so we now have authorization of $302 million. 
Now turning to our first quarter 2012 financial results. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported $0.37 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, a 54% increase over the first quarter of last year. Similarly, our proportional free cash flow grew 51% during the first quarter. Victoria will discuss the drivers of our performance in more detail, but I am pleased with our results, which puts us in a strong position for the year. We delivered this healthy performance despite having had an extremely mild winter in the U.S., one of the warmest in recent history, which affected us doubly through low natural gas and energy prices, as well as lower demand.
The second topic I'd like to address is DP&L. During the first quarter, we continued with our plans to integrate DP&L with the rest of AES' portfolio. We named the new President and CEO of DP&L, Phil Harrington. Phil has more than 20 years of industry experience, which includes managing a competitive power business. His experience and skills are well suited for today's dynamic Ohio marketplace.
At DP&L, our focus is threefold: Obtaining a constructive outcome in the rate proceedings for 2013, executing on our retail strategy and achieving operating efficiencies as a business.
As you may recall, DP&L's current generation rate expired in December of 2012. To establish the tariff for 2013 and beyond, DP&L filed a market rate option or MRO with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio at the end of March. Under the proposed terms of the MRO, DP&L will transition customers to market prices for generation over the next 5 years. We are working closely with the Ohio commission, customers and other interested parties to arrive at a constructive outcome for all stakeholders in a timely manner.
The staff's comments were issued last Friday, and they were very productive. We are where we expected to be at this stage of the process.
The team at DP&L is also focused on enhancing their retail capabilities. Customer switching trends at DP&L for the first quarter of 2012 were in line with our guidance for the year as 3% of the load switched during the quarter. As of the end of March, 53% of the total retail load had switched to ultimate suppliers, but DP&L's retail arm was able to capture 78% of those switched loads. The reduction in DP&L's gross margin in the quarter as a result of customers switching is approximately $27 million, up $18 million from the first quarter of 2011. DP&L's retail arm is now not only aggressively working to retain customers in its service territory but it is also branching out to attract new customers in Illinois and other areas of Ohio. DP&L's retail subsidiary, MC Squared, recently won a competitive bid auction to supply several North Shore, Illinois communities with electricity for up to 3 years.
We are also taking a careful look at ways to improve our operating margins at DP&L and our North American portfolio in general. Due to current low natural gas prices, the near-term outlook for DP&L is challenging and admittedly disappointing relative to our expectations at the time we announced the acquisition. However, forecast for DP&L are still within our guidance range for this year and consistent with our earnings growth rate targets for 2013 to 2015.
Thirdly, I'd like to update you on our asset sales program. We continue to make good progress on narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling select, nonstrategic businesses. Since our last call, we closed the sales of our Ironwood and Red Oak plants for a total of $227 million. In addition, today, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell 100% of our interest in the 379-megawatt small hydro assets in China. On a proportional basis, we will sell 72 megawatts. Proceeds are expected to be approximately $48 million, and we believe this transaction will close in the second half of 2012. Including the transaction announced today, we have closed and signed asset sales totaling $804 million, about 40% of the potential $2 billion universe of nonstrategic assets that could be sold. The average P/E multiple realized on these sales was more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. These sales have also led to the deconsolidation of $1.7 billion of non-recourse debt from our balance sheet.
Finally, as we laid out in our fourth quarter earnings call, we're executing a balanced approach to capital allocation, which aims to balance strong total shareholder returns with profitable growth.
Now let me review the primary sources of available cash that we will allocate this year. In addition to our asset-sale proceeds, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of parent free cash flow. This will bring our total net discretionary cash for the year to approximately $1.3 billion.
Now let me lay out how we plan to use our available cash. We intend to use approximately 2/3 or $920 million to delever the company and buy back stock. To date, we have already paid down $197 million of expensive non-recourse debt in Brazil, and we have used another $285 million to repay borrowings on our corporate revolver, which we drew on to fund the acquisition of DP&L. As I mentioned previously, our Board of Directors has increased the outstanding authorization for share buybacks from $122 million to $302 million. We have not repurchased any shares since the fourth quarter of 2011 because we used our liquidity to fund the acquisition of DP&L and then, in the first quarter, to pay down associated borrowings under the revolver. Nonetheless, at current prices, we see share buybacks as a value accretive investment. In addition, starting in Q4, we will be paying a $30 million quarterly dividend. With respect to the remaining 1/3 of our discretionary free cash or approximately $360 million, we intend to utilize the sum to grow our portfolio or to further invest in our balance sheet. 
Before making any final determination, we will apply the capital allocation framework we discussed in our last call with the goal of maximizing risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders. To that end, we will provide you with an update on our capital allocation plan as we make progress on asset sales and realize the free cash flow being generated by our existing businesses.
Now let me provide you with an update on our development projects. We are only proceeding with those projects that meet our investment criteria in markets where we believe we have a compelling, competitive advantage. We are giving preference to those projects that expand upon existing platforms and use pools of local liquidity, either debt or cash. Our goal is to significantly improve on our overall capital efficiency and return on invested capital.
In Chile, we are making good progress on our 2 most advanced development projects, Cochrane and Alto Maipo. Cochrane is a 532-megawatt coal-fired plant adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos project in the northern grid. And Alto Maipo is a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant near the load center in Santiago. Alto Maipo is an expansion of our existing 209 Alfalfal run of the river hydro facility. We have already received a number of critical milestones on both projects, including securing the necessary environmental permits. We are currently working on the power offtake agreement, construction contracts and financing. Given our large position in Chile, we expect the equity needs of the 2 projects to be -- or supplied through the local Chilean market or through cash being generated at the AES Gener level. 
We're also making good progress in the Philippines, where we had a 630-megawatt coal-fired expansion project adjacent to our existing 660-megawatt Masinloc facility. Recently, the Philippine government approved this project for various investment incentives, such as an income tax holiday. The project team is now focused on offtake agreements, EPC contracts and non-recourse financing with the view to close in 2013.
In India, where we have strap cash in our joint venture with the state government of Orissa, we are making progress in deploying that cash towards a tripling of capacity at our OPGC facility. 
Our initial equity contributions to the platform expansions in India and the Philippines are unlikely to occur before 2013 as the projects can self-fund early stage development activities.
In addition to these platform expansion projects, we're making steady progress on building on our wind development pipeline in Poland and the U.K. and the development of 2 thermal projects, one in Colombia via Chivor, a 1000-megawatt hydro owned by AES Gener, and one in Turkey via our joint venture with  Koç. We're also moving forward with smaller but highly profitable platform expansions, like a 20-megawatt lithium ion battery facility related to the Angamos facility in Chile, to Ingetec [ph] , a 20-megawatt expansion of our hydro plant at Chivor in Colombia, and closing our open cycle Los Mina gas plant in the Dominican Republic. We expect our equity investments in all of these projects in 2012 to be modest. 
Our larger construction projects are also progressing well. In Chile, we expect the 270-megawatt coal-fired Campiche plant to be commissioned in early 2013. And in Vietnam, our 1,200-megawatt coal-fired Mong Duong plant remains on track for commissioning in 2015.
Overall, I am pleased with the growth prospects that we have across our portfolio. We have not seen any negative effects from our reduction in business development expenditures. Our greater focus on platform expansions has lowered development cost and is yielding projects with higher average returns and greater capital efficiency, which we define as net present value over AES equity investment. Even so, in all cases, the value created by development projects must beat the value creation opportunity we have through share buybacks and debt repayment. As I mentioned on the last quarterly call, we will implement our capital allocation framework with the goal of achieving an average 3-year total return of 8% to 10% from 2013 through 2015.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Victoria to discuss our strong results in the first quarter in greater detail."

Today, I'll cover the following topics: our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.",1365,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following topics: our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
First, let's review our financial results for the quarter. Our proportional gross margin increased by $172 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by the contributions of our new businesses, including Dayton Power & Light in the U.S., Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, as well as strong volume growth in Latin America. In addition, gross margin benefited from settlement of several prior period claims at Cartagena in Spain. These disputes were resolved earlier this quarter, allowing us to record a proportional pretax benefit of approximately $67 million.
However, we also experienced some headwinds during the quarter. At AES Gener, lower spot pricing reduced margins in the SING in the Northern part of Chile. This is a significant trend we're experiencing this year, which I will cover in more detail when I discuss our full year 2012 guidance expectations. Beyond this, as many of you know, the tariff reset process for Eletropaulo in Brazil is still underway. However, on April 19, the regulator there issued a preliminary tariff proposal, which is lower than previously expected.
To reflect our updated projections of the tariff reset outcome on AES, we increased our pretax regulatory liability to $162 million for the quarter, which includes a catch-up liability of $29 million for the second half of 2011. Relative to our previous expectations, this equates to an incremental ongoing $5 million impact to proportional gross margin per quarter as AES owns 16% of Eletropaulo.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. First quarter results increased by $0.13 to $0.37. The new businesses contributed $0.06 during the quarter, and higher volumes in Latin America added $0.05. Lower prices primarily related to the tariff reset expectation in Eletropaulo in Brazil and spot prices in Chile reduced earnings per share by $0.04. Beyond this, outages at our plants in Northern Ireland and Panama impacted the quarter by $0.02. Repairs in those locations are nearing completion, and most of those plants will be back online later this quarter. In addition, our Esti plant in Panama is also scheduled to the back online early in the second half of 2012. Finally, the settlement at Cartagena added $0.06 for the quarter. In total, the trends affecting gross margin added $0.11. Lower G&A cost and other factors contributed $0.02 in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. When compared to a year earlier, diluted or GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.14 to $0.44 for the quarter, driven by an increase in gross margin and a gain on the sale of Cartagena, but offset by impairment losses, which are excluded from adjusted earnings per share.
Now turning to cash flow. The same operating trends also drove our cash flow performance for the quarter. We recorded year-over-year gains on both a consolidated and a proportional basis. On a consolidated basis, our net cash from operating activities increased 6% year-over-year. Our proportional free cash flow increased 51% to $235 million for the quarter. 
These positive cash flow trends also benefited parent liquidity during the quarter. Not only did we generate $229 million from the close of the sale of our business in Cartagena in Spain, but we also realized $176 million in subsidiary distributions from ongoing operation. Finally, as Andres mentioned, we repaid $285 million of borrowings under our corporate revolver that have been previously drawn during our acquisition of DP&L in late 2011. As a result, we ended the first quarter with more than $900 million of parent liquidity, up from $693 million at year end 2011, significantly strengthening the parent balance sheet.
In summary, we report a strong quarter across most financial metrics. Further, we're on track with our cost-cutting initiatives as we expect to achieve $50 million of savings in 2012 and cumulative cost savings of $100 million by the end of 2013. With all of these levers in hand, we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments in 2012 and beyond.
Now let me give you an update on our 2012 guidance. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share and all cash flow metrics based on the trends we currently see. However, we are lowering U.S. GAAP earnings per share guidance at this time from a range of $1.28 to $1.36 to $1.22 to $1.30, reflecting the $0.06 of noncash impairment recorded during the quarter.
Now let me discuss trends impacting our guidance metrics in greater detail. Since our last call, there have been both positive and negative developments that have had an impact on our 2012 forecast.
Starting with our earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, relative to our budget, we experienced a decline in spot market pricing in Chile during the quarter. Lower spot prices in Northern Chile were primarily driven by the temporary market pricing impacts of fuel supply dynamics at competitor plants. AES Gener's exposure to lower spot prices in Northern Chile reduced adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.04. However, in June, contracted capacity at AES Gener's new Angamos facility will increase from 65% to 90%. So the exposure to this market pricing factor will be reduced during the second half of the year. 
In addition, the Eletropaulo tariff reset is still pending, and it's expected to be finalized by June of this year. Relative to our previous 2012 guidance, we now have to absorb a $0.02 reduction in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our Q1 regulatory liability accruals. We will, of course, update you once this important tariff change is finalized.
Another factor affecting our 2012 operational outlook is the loss of earnings from the Red Oak and Ironwood plans due to their sale, which is approximately $0.01. As these asset sales are now closed, we have reflected this in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range.
On a positive side, since December 2011, foreign exchange and commodity price forward curves have moved in our favor. We've updated our guidance to reflect the forward curves as of March 31, 2012. This resulted in a positive impact of $0.06 in adjusted earnings per share. Finally, we're projecting a $0.01 benefit from investing our discretionary cash in planned debt paydown and share repurchases in the second half of 2012. 
Further, as previously noted on our last call, our adjusted earnings per share guidance assumes the extension of the U.S. income tax deferral benefits originally enacted under TIPRA. This is reflected in an effective tax rate for 2012, which remains generally in line with our 29% tax rate for 2011. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year, but it has not as yet been passed. As a result, we've been hard at work this quarter developing tax mitigation strategies to reduce the full year estimated earnings impact from approximately $0.12 to $0.02 to $0.03 this year should TIPRA not be extended before year end. Recall that this is a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion.
Considering all of these factors, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for 2012. 
In terms of our cash flow guidance, we expect 2012 to come in near the lower end of our range for both consolidated and proportional measures. This is largely due to higher working capital requirements in Brazil, higher environmental CapEx anticipated at AES Gener, as well as the loss of cash flow from asset sales.
Note that our current guidance includes only the impacts of asset sales that have closed as of April 2012, including Red Oak and Ironwood. We have not yet included the impact of our China asset sale in our guidance, but we expect it to be minimal as this business was not expected to be a significant contributor to our 2012 financials.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres."

It lines with the statutes in Ohio and advances the public policy to its competition. And for us, it really protects the financial integrity of the company and, importantly, allows us to emerge in this transition period as a viable competitor in the market. That said, the staff comments basically had indicated that they believe we could get all those outcomes with an ESP and, in fact, advised that we consider. And I think the words in their comments were strongly advised that we consider it because it had more advantages to us. But we're entering the technical conference -- the pre-conference hearings next week. We've had a very open engagement with interveners and with staff. I think our view is that there's enough commonality of interest that settlement is a possibility. And my sense is that as we move towards the evidentiary hearing in June, probably the best time to find some common ground. So we are open to the comments. We're open to proposals. Our view is that if we were to consider moving forward from an MRO to an ESP, we would only do so if it gave us the same benefits as the MRO does. And if the staff is correct that there are greater advantages, we surely would consider heading down the road of a settlement. And our view is that the settlement could be done in a timely way within the schedule laid out by the commission. So I think that's the way we're seeing it."

My view is that within the next 2 years, we'll make substantial progress on that. As Andres had said, the approach at DP&L is 3-pronged and they're almost in series. The first thing we have to do is we have to get the case completed. We have clarity in a lot of the issues. At the same time, the next thing is to really continue to drive on the regulatory strategy. We've made a lot of changes. Adding Phil Harrington is a very important step for us with his competitive experience. We've integrated MC Squared into the retail function broadly at DP&L. We're doing a lot of operational sharing between our other businesses. And that will lead us then to such really drive cost out for 2 reasons: One is because I think across the business, we should do that. We have the capability at AES to do that.

In terms of the NPV created, for example, at Angamos, to give you an idea -- and again, I can't give you an exact number, we have target for Cochrane, not until we send all the PPAs and finalize the contract, but the NPV created at Angamos was about $300 million. And we're also expanding on the Angamos facility by putting a 20-megawatt battery, lithium ion battery facility there. Alto Maipo would be a very profitable project. It's a large project. It has a -- even though it's run of the river, there's a lot of construction involved. So that would -- if we -- starting now, this is a project which would come onstream around '15, '16. And so those are the 3 main projects. I think when you look at them from a -- so the other one, of course, is Masinloc 2. We -- so let me go back a little bit. So thinking of the 2 Gener projects, you're talking about probably equity needs of around $400 million over the next 3 years and that would come from -- locally through Gener's cash flow and other means. And then if we look at Masinloc, Masinloc does not have the same sort of support, which we're basically looking at a 630-megawatt expansion of the existing, current Masinloc facility. So you're probably talking about -- maybe half that amount, about $200 million. And that's a little bit less advanced than the 2 projects that are in Chile."

You're right, when we think about it, what you're dealing with now is residential customers. And looking at a large commercial, industrial customers initially, we had a higher capture rate because we had a much tighter relationship they were in franchise. We had relationships ongoing. We had a high rate, not significantly high. We're still pretty good. So what you see is 2 things: One, you're seeing different classes of customers now. And now the competition is fully over at residential customers and they're coming either into markets or aggregation or sort of one-off door -- knocking on the door and getting an opt-in customer. The competition is increasing, so that's why the numbers have dropped slightly in the recapture. So our overall capture rate, if you work off the numbers that Andres has given us, is about 87% still affiliated with the DP&L brand, which is critically important because having that brand affiliation will help us with being able to place that generation going forward. So that's why it's very important for us to actually capture customers. I think one of the issues of aggregation, what we've seen here, is that it's going as we expected. There's been a little slowdown in the aggregation rate, meaning that actions haven't happened as quickly as we can, but we still think aggregation will move as we plan and as we expect.

Thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased to announce that Tom O'Flynn will be joining us as our new CFO in September. Tom is a great addition to our man",2100,"Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased to announce that Tom O'Flynn will be joining us as our new CFO in September. Tom is a great addition to our management team and brings a strong combination of financial skills, senior corporate experience and extensive knowledge of the energy and infrastructure sectors.
I'm looking forward to working with Tom to execute on our plans to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
I would also like to take a moment to thank Mary Wood for doing a great job as interim CFO over the past 90 days. Once Tom is on board, Mary will resume her prior position in the finance organization as our Controller. 
Now as you might have seen in our press release, we are at $0.18 of adjusted EPS for the second quarter. And although this is below below last year's level, our results year-to-date of $0.55 are in line with our commitment to our full year guidance. Mary will walk you through the specific drivers later in this call.
Turning to Slide 3, I will provide you with an update on the strategic plan that we laid out late last year to unlock shareholder value. I will then discuss some of the key macro trends affecting the portfolio, as well as recent developments in our more significant businesses.  And following Mary's review our financial results, I will discuss our capital allocation plan for the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 4, and just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for unlocking shareholder value are: One, optimizing capital allocation; two, growing the profitability of the existing portfolio; and three, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets.
We feel we're making good progress on executing on the strategic plans we laid out. Regarding the narrowing of our geographic focus, we have raised $800 million through asset sales, excited several non-core markets and invested most of these proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet.
At the same time, we're improving the profitability of our business by cutting costs, exploring scale in synergies and making high return investments based on our existing platforms.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let me provide some color on how we're optimizing our capital allocation and considering all uses of discretionary tax, including de-levering, share repurchases, project and increases in our dividend to improve our total shareholder return.
Over the last 9 months, we have made earlier payment on approximately $500 million of debt between repaying the corporate revolver and paying down the expensive debt at our Brazilian subsidiary in Brazil. With respect to share repurchases, since our last call, we have bought back more than 20 million shares for a total investment of $252 million. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since September  to 29 million shares or about 4% of those outstanding.
Our total investment in our stock since September is more than $341 million, implying an average purchase price of $11.57 per share. Additionally, last week, the board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, our first cash dividend payment in almost 20 years. We expect to grow the dividend over time in accordance with the performance the company and market conditions.  The dividend is and will remain an integral part of our total value proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 6. And let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. We've committed to achieving $50 million of cost savings at the parent level in 2012 and a total of $100 million in cost savings per year by the end of 2013. For 2012, we expect to exceed our target, and are now projecting at least $65 million in savings this year, as we've already reduced SG&A by $31 million during the first 6 months.
Moving to Slide 7, let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus too the asset sale program. Despite a challenging market, we have closed or signed additional deals such as our French win and China portfolios for additional proceeds of $176 million. To date, we've closed our ninth asset sales in September  first quarter motive proceeds to AES of $932 million.
Thus far, we've achieved attractive valuations for these assets at an average P/E multiple of more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. In summary, we believe that we are consistently executing on the plans that we laid out last November.
Next, on Slide 8, I'd like to briefly discuss important macroeconomic trends affecting our portfolio. We have seen a weakening of GDP growth in some of our markets, including Brazil, where the current year GDP growth rate is expected to be about 2% versus prior expectations of 4%. This is also reflected in a 19% year-over-year depreciation of the Brazilian real.
Demand for electric power at Brazil this year expected to grow only about 1%. Nonetheless, over the medium term, we expect growth in Brazil to recover from closer to 4% level and demand for power to grow in line with GDP. In many of our other markets, we're seeing more robust economic growth.
For example, Chile and Colombia's economies are growing at nearly 5% and power demand increasing at up to 7% on some of the grids. Regarding our key markets in the U.S., Ohio's economy is expected to grow in line with the overall U.S. economy at about 2%, while Indiana is slightly lower at about 1%.
This year, power demand is increasing at roughly 1% to 1.5% at our Midwestern utilities and forecast expect a slight pickup next year.
Generally speaking, weaker commodity prices have negatively affected our results year-to-date. On the natural gas front, while we have seen a modest supply side correction and a fall in the gas-only rig counts, prices remain near the $3 per million BTU range, a result of both of our utilities in the U.S. but much more so at DP&L, were positively correlated to U.S. natural gas price.
Regarding oil and coal prices, both have weakened over the past quarter. The broad brush strokes, although our portfolio is roughly 1/3 hydro and renewables, 1/3 natural gas and 1/3 coal, our results are positively correlated to oil prices. Directly those markets where fewer or lower diesel set the marginal price and in others where set by natural gas or LNG linked to oil prices.
On the other hand, AES' results are negative correlated to coal prices, and we're starting to se the benefits from recent price declines. Today, we're in a buyers market, and we are leveraging our aggregated annual spend of nearly $2 billion on solid fuels, unlocking attractive prices for the remainder of the year.
To summarize, our commodity prices have rebounded slightly as of late. Current forward curves still imply a negative EPS impact of around $0.04 relative to where forward curves were as of March 31.
Despite this, we've taken the necessary actions to maintain our adjusted earnings per share forecast within our original guidance range.
Now I would like to give an update on some recent developments at our more prominent businesses. Let's start with Eletropaulo on Slide 9. The electricity regulator in Brazil, issued the final ruling on Eletropaulo's tariff reset on July 2. The final tariff reset represented a larger decline than the April preliminary proposal, and is thus more negative than we had expected.  The variance in the final ruling compared to the April proposal was mainly attributable to the change in the benchmark used to determine the level of non-technical energy losses included in the tariff.
It's important to mention that we have positive track record of improving Eletropaulo's operations through reduced energy losses, cost management and revenue enhancement. Since 2010, AES Brazil has implemented the creating value program, which has contributed approximately BRL 325 million riyals about $160 million to the bottom line through greater productivity and efficiency.
Although we are disappointed with the regulatory outcome at Eletropaulo, I would like to point out that our 2 other Brazilian businesses, Tietê and Zoll, are performing in line with expectations. These 2 businesses represent more than 80% of our earnings from Brazil as we only own 16% of Eletropaulo.
Now turning to Slide 10, I'd like to give an update on DP&L. The business continues to perform this year in line with our expectations. In terms of customer switching, at the end of June, 56% of the load had switched to competitive providers, up 3% from the end of March. I would like to highlight that Diplir, our retail arm, captured more than 78% of the switched loads through the second quarter. As you know, DP&L's current rate plan is set to expire on December 31, 2012.
In March, DP&L filed for approval of its next standard service offering in the form of a market rate offer, or MRO, for 2013 and beyond. At this point, we're in the midst of settlement discussions, the process is constructive but complex, given the number of interveners and the diversity of positions.
Combined with continued low natural gas prices, some of the potential regulatory outcomes that have been proposed by very interveners could result in lower medium-term earnings and cash flows from this business.
We continue to work towards an outcome that is very reasonable for all stakeholders, and we remain hopeful that we will have a resolution in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.
Overall, contributions from this business will depend heavily on the final outcome of the MRO.
In the meantime, we're positioning this business for success in the competitive marketplace by expanding our retail capabilities and enhancing the efficiency of our North American portfolio. DP&L's retailer marketing business, declare, and MC Squared, are rapidly expanding in markets beyond DP&L's service territory.
We are now serving more than 140,000 customers outside of our service area in Dayton, representing annual usage of about 2.5 million-megawatt hours. This growth more than offset 70,000 customers and 2.1 million-megawatt hours that have switched to unaffiliated third-party on DP&L's system.
Overall, for 2012, we're projecting that DP&L's Retail business will serve approximately 200,000 customers with combined annual retail sales of 8 million-megawatt hours.
In terms of reducing costs, AES is on track to achieve nearly $10 million in synergy savings across its North American per portfolio businesses this year, and we are aggressively pursuing additional opportunities.
Moving to Slide 11, we are seeing positive momentum and some of our other businesses in the portfolio. For example, in the Philippines, our Masinloc plant achieved record performance in May and June. We have seen similar transit at our Kilroot plant in Northern Ireland, and we have benefited from lower coal prices.
Overall, while in the last quarter, we faced headwinds at some of our businesses, given the results of our portfolio year-to-date, we are confident that we can deliver on our adjusted EPS and proportional cash flow guidance for 2012, which as you know, represents a roughly 20% increase over 2011.
Looking beyond 2012, as I discussed on our last call, we faced some challenges in 2013, including low capacity and natural gas prices at DP&L. In 2014 and '15, we see favorable trends, including improved capacity prices in PGM, greater demand growth in key markets such as Brazil, Chile and Colombia, improved earnings from our wind portfolio, contributions from our current construction projects and value creation for our capital allocation decisions.
Over the medium term, we remain optimistic about our earnings trajectory and business prospects. The new capital allocation strategy has improved returns on new projects by focusing on utilizing passion local leverage capacity and expanding on existing platforms.  We're focusing on those platform expansion projects that require little equity from AES and shorter lead times to make the greatest contributions to the bottom line.
The near-term examples of these types of projects include Hana, a 20-megawatt Hydro facility related to our 1,000-megawatt hydro plant in Colombia. In the 52 megawatt of lithium ion battery facilities co-located with the Angamos and Deepwater plants. Another potential project is the closing of the open cycle at the Los Mina's plant and making greater use of our Andres facility in the Dominican Republic.
So these projects will be constructed relatively quickly, require less equity from AES and will generate earnings faster than Greenfield construction.
As far as 2013 is concerned, we will issue guidance no later than the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.
Now Mary will review the drivers of our quarterly results and our 2012 guidance in more detail. Gary?"

This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: First, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and",1334,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: First, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and free cash flow; second, current liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.18 of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and $0.55 for the first half of 2012. For our first half results, we are still in line with our internal expectations for the full year.
Later in my remarks, I will walk through what we see as the key drivers of adjusted EPS for the second half of this year, and why we believe that full year results will still be in line with our guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30, although at the lower end.
Before covering the results in more detail, I would like to provide some perspective on the year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS we experienced this quarter.
First, during the second quarter of 2011, Kinner in Chile had a strong quarter due to significant spot sales at favorable prior prices. We do not expect that opportunity to reoccur in 2012, and we project lower results from this business in the second quarter of this year.
Panera also had some planned and unplanned outages at its coal-fired facilities during the second quarter of this year. The lower volume also contributed to the year-over-year trend.  All affected plants are back on line and performing in line with our expectations. 
Second, early results included an additional and final adjustment to the new Tara for Eletropaulo recently approved by the regulator, which was a tougher outcome than anticipated and required a catch-up accrual.  These factors affecting 2 of our more significant businesses explain much of the year-over-year decline. These headwinds were partially offset by contributions from our new businesses, which are expected to continue to make significant year-over-year contributions in the second half of 2012.
Now turning to Slide 13, our proportional gross margin decreased by $56 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. Gener recorded a reduction of $60 million, approximately half due to lower spot sales and half due to lower plant availability.
The proportional gross margin impact of the Eletropaulo tariff reset was $35 million for the quarter, including a catch-up accrual of $12 million.  This represents the final adjustment for the tariff decision as we have been accruing for the outcome since the third quarter of 2011.
In addition, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates had an impact of $20 million. These trends were partially offset by the contributions of new businesses in the United States, Bulgaria and Latin America.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share on Slide 14, second quarter results decreased by $0.11 to $0.18. Gener in Chile accounted for $0.07 of the decline, Electropaolo, primarily due to the final tariff reset, represented $0.04 of the reduction. Offsetting these declines, new businesses contributed $0.04 during the quarter. A reduction in SG&A also added $0.02 for the quarter. Foreign exchange headwinds reduced adjusted EPS by $0.02 for the quarter, primarily driven by the Brazilian riel, which has depreciated by 19%.
Together, the operating drivers accounted for $0.07 of the decline. In terms of non-operating drivers, the quarterly effective tax rate was higher than the rate from the year-earlier due in part to a change in the book income mix, which resulted in a $0.03 reduction year-over-year.  We expect the reduction in the effective tax rate on a full year basis.
Now turning to cash flow on Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased 44% compared to the second quarter of 2011. This was driven by contributions from new businesses and a higher cash flow from Latin American generation due to improved working capital, partially offset by a decline at Eletropaulo adjusted for a 16% ownership stake.
Now I will review our parent liquidity as of the end of June on Slide 16. During the quarter, we benefited from $677 million of inflows from our asset sales and cash from our subsidiaries. During the quarter, we invested $230 million in share repurchases. After $323 million of corporate interests, overhead and investments, we ended the second quarter with more than $1 billion of parent liquidity, up from $911 million at the end of the first quarter.
We are pleased with our operating performance that provides us ample liquidity to increase value for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 17, I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Although we have phase significant headwinds, we expect to offset most of these with new businesses, operational improvements, cost reductions and capital allocation initiatives that we have been discussing for the last few quarters.
Accordingly, we are affirming our 2012 adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance, although we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range. Next, I will review the specific drivers of our second half of 2012 performance and how we expect to achieve our adjusted EPS target, the year-over-year changes in our businesses, as well as proactive steps that we have taken to improve our earnings.
Turning to Slide 18, our pro forma adjusted EPS was $0.56 in the second half of 2011, excluding the pre-closing interest cost from the $2 billion of parent debt that we issued to fund the acquisition of DP&L.
We believe that the performance of our businesses will be largely consistent with the second half of 2011. Beyond this, we expect to generate an additional $0.11 to $0.15 of earnings, with approximately 70% or $0.09 of this expected increase, driven by contributions from new businesses. As a reminder, Maritza, Changuinola and Angamos achieved full commercial operations late in the second half of 2011, and DP&L was acquired in late November.
In addition, our key initiatives such as cost-cutting, operational improvements in capital allocation are expected to contribute roughly $0.06. These gains are partially offset by year-over-year comedy and foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $0.03 to $0.04.  $0.11 to $0.15 of improvement that we are targeting in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2011 just put us in the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for the year.
Although we expect the third and fourth quarters of 2012 to record gains year-over-year, the second half increase is more weighted towards the fourth quarter. As discussed in our last call, our guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation our CFC look through provision, originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend the tax legislation later this year.  Based on actions taken last Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee, which voted for a 2-year extension, we continue to expect this will occur.
If the CFC looks extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion. Overall, we continue to project that tax rate in the low 30% range, generally in line with the rate we recorded in 2011.
Turning to our cash flow guidance on Slide 19. As we discussed on our last call, we expect our full year results to achieve lower end of our range of the portion of free cash flow, primarily as a result of working capital changes and assets sold this year.
We are also now guiding to the lower end of our range on subsidiary distributions, as we may elect to retain some operating cash at our key platform businesses such as Gener for tax-efficient investment purposes. In summary, we are pulling other levers available to us to meet our guidance despite the headwinds that we experienced in the last quarter.
I just would now I just our plans for capital allocation for the second half of 2012."

This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we already allocated 61% to strengthening our balance sheet.
We have used another $145 million or 9% for our joint venture in Turkey and wind projects in the U.K. and Poland to realize the value of recent pipeline acquisitions.  We expect invest an additional $132 million in other growth opportunities during the second half of the year.
This leaves us with roughly $350 million of discretionary cash that we have not yet allocated. We will continue to update you on our capital location plan as we received the cash later this year.
Turning to Slide 21. In terms of future growth, our construction program or rates on schedule. Construction work at our 270-megawatt Campiche project in Chile is progressing well, and it's expected to commence operations in early 2013. This project, a 216-megawatt power plant in Cameroon is also expected to come online in 2013. Additionally, the 1,200-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam is commercial group commercial operations in 2015 and similar construction rates are underway on the site. As a reminder, we have already made the necessary equity contributions and have committed nonrecourse debt financing for all of these construction projects.
In terms of future value creation, we will continue to focus on those markets and platforms where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage.
To that end, we're making markers and our advanced developing by pleasure Chile, Columbia and the U.S. In Chile, we have the Cochrane project, a 532-megawatt expansion adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos pant. We are also progressing on now to Mai Pogue, a 531-megawatt one of the River near Santiago that builds upon our existing facility.
In the U.S., we'll roll our platform at Indianapolis Power & Light with investments in environmental controls and some of our coal-fired generation units that will earn regulated returns.
Outside of the 3 biggest markets, we also see growth opportunities in the Philippines and India. We're working on Masinloc 2, a brownfield expansion of our very successful mass in the Masinloc plants in the Philippines, and India, we're pursuing an expansion of our OPGC facility and expect to be able to fund a substantial portion of our equity with local liquidity.
All development projects, we will utilize the most capital-efficient funding sources, including local cash generation and leverage capacity, however, possible to reduce the required AES equity contribution and improve AES' capital efficiency. 
In closing, we believe that the successful execution of our strategy consisting of disciplined capital allocation, platform expansions, cost cutting and efficiently initiatives will allow us to create more value for our shareholders.
With respect to the second half of 2012, we expect the contributions from our new plants and businesses which came online late last year, availability in Chile will deliver strong growth this year.
In summary, we expect to meet our commitment and achieve our adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance for 2012.

So we do have those things coming on. We also expect more, say, demand growth in some of the markets. We know that there better capacity prices in PJM, which will also be a big pickup. So -- and not that we're just going to be relying on share buyback. I also think that we will have full years of the earning -- sorry, cost savings from the programs that we implemented this year and next in terms of becoming more efficient in terms of SG&A and other factors of costs. Because we are really looking at costs across our portfolio. So in the $65 million that we're talking about, that's really at the parent level. That does not include, for example, the efficiency initiatives on our North American portfolio. That does not include the initiatives in Brazil, in other markets.

Going forward, we will be looking at is those things that really help us have a more focused portfolio, as well as help us reduce the cost of some of those support services that we have, and there are also businesses from which we think we cannot grow. So you're correct in the sense that we had looked at renewables because they were low on earnings. Because we said, that for example, if we look at U.S. wind today, we do really have that pickup in '14, '15, and that's in terms of our earnings. We also do have our solar joint venture with Riverstone, and we'll be looking together in ways of monetizing that over the future. So our -- I would like to get it specific cases prior to really having something concrete. But we are not really changing from our original position. I think we are executing well, but we're not going to do fire sales. We're going to make sure that we sell the assets in the right form to maximize price. For example, our China assets, there's one case where we did receive bids for it as one package, and we realized we could do much better by selling it apart.

This is a normal process in Brazil after tariff review or administrative procedure of that may have done gone wrong. In our administrative filing, which was filed shortly after the case came out, we basically raised 2 key points. One was in the removal from the shielded assets -- excuse me, the shielded rate asset base of 2007 to 2011, of these particular cables. We believe that's a procedural and administrative integration to go in things should then asset base, as well as the loss benchmark that Andres has referred to earlier. In Brazil, this loss benchmark is used for over 40% of the distribution businesses, and shows that statistically, the benchmark was an outlier and therefore, we're appealing for both of those. Process for that, if there were to be a change or at a benefit that would come out of that, it probably would be applied at the time of the next half adjustment, which we would be July 2013 and be retroactive back to July 2011. We have done this in the past. We've had some movement, but given the force of the issues here, I don't want to raise false expectations. But we were already taken that action.

I mean, we have -- in terms of large markets where we're present, Brazil is a market with a rapidly growing energy demand and where we have a very substantial footprint. We still have a lot of unlevered capacity, leverage capacity, I should say, which is a contracted 3,000 megawatts of Hydro. When we look at what Eletropaulo, we do own, 16%, we did develop the telecoms outside of Eletropaulo. And we also have the footprint in the South in the business of Zoll. Our footprint in Brazil is more than just Eletropaulo. We are one of the players there, and we do have the capacity to grow. And we do have now very good relations with BNDES and can finance new project. We will do projects, of course, that are good projects. So that's -- we have the capacity for growth, but we're making sure that we grow from good projects. Regarding Eletropaulo, we have in effect in the process of reducing our position there since 2006. We sold down half of our holdings, and we took out the telco. So the important thing for us is Eletropaulo is more -- we felt more regulatory challenges than other business there. And that given -- we have I think, given what we could do we've managed, as well as possible. So right now, with we're focusing on is making sure that we make it as a profitable business, as possible within the new guideline. And this is our second major cost efficiency program that we're doing that is creating value. We have done prior to that. So I guess, in a nutshell, we still see Brazil is an interesting market. We still have that critical footprint, and we still have the unused leverage at Kinect, which I think we are going to be focusing on. Eletropaulo has been challenging and we've done everything we can to restore profitability of that business."

Thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased to announce that Tom O'Flynn will be joining us as our new CFO in September. Tom is a great addition to our man",2128,"Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased to announce that Tom O'Flynn will be joining us as our new CFO in September. Tom is a great addition to our management team and brings a strong combination of financial skills, senior corporate experience and extensive knowledge of the energy and infrastructure sectors. I'm looking forward to working with Tom to execute on our plans to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. I would also like to take a moment to thank Mary Wood for doing a great job as Interim CFO over the past 90 days. Once Tom is on board, Mary will resume her prior position in the finance organization as our Controller.
Now as you might have seen in our press release, we're at $0.18 of adjusted EPS for the second quarter. And although this is below last year's level, our result, year-to-date, of $0.55 are in line with our commitment to our full year guidance. Mary will walk you through the specific drivers later in this call.
Turning to Slide 3. I will provide you with an update on the strategic plan that we laid out late last year to unlock shareholder value. I will then discuss some of the key macro trends affecting the portfolio, as well as recent developments at our more significant businesses. And following Mary's review our financial results, I will discuss our capital allocation plan for the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 4. And just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for unlocking shareholder value are: one, optimizing capital allocation; two, growing the profitability of existing portfolio; and three, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets. We feel we're making good progress on executing on the strategic plans we laid out. Regarding the narrowing of our geographic focus, we have raised $800 million through asset sales, exited several non-core markets and invested most of these proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet. At the same time, we're improving the profitability of our business by cutting cost, exploiting scale in synergies and making high return investments based on our existing platforms.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let me provide some color on how we're optimizing our capital allocation by considering all uses of discretionary tax, including delevering, share repurchases, growth project and increases in our dividend to improve our total shareholder return. Over the last 9 months, we have made earlier payment on approximately $500 million of debt between repaying the corporate revolver and paying down the expensive debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary in Brazil. With respect to share repurchases, since our last call, we have bought back more than 20 million shares, a total investment of $252 million. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since September to 29 million shares, about 4% of those outstanding. Our total investment in our stock since September is more than $341 million, implying an average purchase price of $11.57 per share. Additionally, last week, the board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, our first cash dividend payment in almost 20 years. We expect to grow the dividend over time in accordance with the performance of the company and market conditions. The dividend is and will remain an integral part of our total value proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 6. And let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. We've committed to achieving $50 million of cost savings at the parent level in 2012 and a total of $100 million in cost savings per year by the end of 2013. For 2012, we expect to exceed our target and are now projecting at least $65 million in savings this year as we've already reduced SG&A by $31 million during the first 6 months.
Moving to Slide 7. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through the asset sale program. Despite a challenging market, we have closed or signed additional deals, such as our French win and China portfolios for additional proceeds of $176 million. To date, we've closed our ninth asset sales in September for cumulative proceeds to AES of $932 million. Thus far, we've achieved attractive valuations for these assets at an average P/E multiple of more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. In summary, we believe that we're consistently executing on the plans that we laid out last November.
Next, on Slide 8, I'd like to briefly discuss important macroeconomic trends affecting our portfolio. We have seen a weakening of GDP growth in some of our markets, including Brazil, where the current year GDP growth rate is expected to be about 2% versus prior expectations of 4%. This is also reflected in a 19% year-over-year depreciation of the Brazilian real. Demand for electric power at Eletropaulo in Brazil this year is expected to grow only about 1%. Nonetheless, over the medium term, we expect growth in Brazil to recover and closer to 4% level and demand for power to grow in line with GDP. In many of our other markets, we are seeing more robust economic growth. For example, Chile and Colombia's economies are growing at nearly 5%, with power demand increasing at up to 7% on some of the grids. Regarding our key markets in the U.S., Ohio's economy is expected to grow in line with the overall U.S. economy at about 2%, while Indiana is slightly lower at about 1%. This year, power demand is increasing at roughly 1% to 1.5% at our Midwestern utilities and most forecast expect a slight pickup next year.
Generally speaking, weaker commodity prices have negatively affected our results year-to-date. On the natural gas front, while we have seen a modest supply side correction and a fall in the gas-only rig count, prices remain near the $3 per million BTU range, a result of both of our utilities in the U.S. but much more so at DP&L or positively correlated to U.S. natural gas price. Regarding oil and coal prices, both have weakened over the past quarter with broad brush strokes. Although our portfolio is roughly 1/3 hydro and renewables, 1/3 natural gas and 1/3 coal, our results are positively correlated to oil price directly in those markets where fewer oil or diesel set the marginal price and in others where it is set by natural gas or LNG linked to oil price. On the other hand, AES' results are negatively correlated to coal prices, and we're starting to see the benefit from recent price declines. Today, we're in a buyer's market, and we are leveraging our aggregated annual spend of nearly $2 billion on solid fuels, unlocking attractive prices for the remainder of the year. To summarize, our both currency and commodity prices have rebounded slightly as of late. Current forward curves still imply a negative EPS impact of around $0.04 relative to where forward curves were as of March 31. Despite this, we've taken the necessary actions to maintain our adjusted earnings per share forecast within our original guidance range.
Now I would like to give you an update on some of recent developments at our more prominent businesses. Let's start with Eletropaulo on Slide 9. ANEEL, the electricity regulator in Brazil, issued the final ruling on Eletropaulo's tariff reset on July 2. The final tariff reset represented a larger decline than the April preliminary proposal and is thus more negative than we had expected. The variance in the final ruling compared to the April proposal was mainly attributable to the change in the benchmark used to determine the level of non-technical energy losses included in the tariff. It's important to mention that we have a positive track record of improving Eletropaulo's operation through reduced energy losses, cost management and revenue enhancement. Since 2010, AES Brazil has implemented the creating value program, which has contributed approximately BRL 325 million or about $160 million to the bottom line through greater productivity and efficiency. Although we are disappointed with the regulatory outcome at Eletropaulo, I would like to point out that our 2 other Brazilian businesses, Tietê and Sul, performing in line with expectations. These 2 businesses represent more than 80% of our earnings from Brazil as we only own 16% of Eletropaulo.
Now turning to Slide 10. I'd like to give an update on DP&L. The business continues to perform this year in line with our expectations. In terms of customer switching, at the end of June, 56% of the load had switched to competitive providers, up 3% from the end of March. I would like to highlight that DPLER, our retail arm, captured more than 78% of the switched load through the second quarter. As you know, DP&L's current rate plan is set to expire on December 31, 2012. In March, DP&L filed for approval of its next standard service offering in the form of a market rate offer, or MRO, to determine its tariff for 2013 and beyond. At this point, we're in the midst of settlement discussion. The process is constructive but complex given the number of interveners and the diversity of positions. Combined with continued low natural gas prices, some of the potential regulatory outcome that have been proposed by various interveners could result in lower medium-term earnings and cash flows from this business. We continue to work towards an outcome that is fair and reasonable for all stakeholders, and we remain hopeful that we will have a resolution in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Overall contributions from this business will depend heavily on the final outcome of the MRO.
In the meantime, we're positioning this business for our success in the competitive marketplace by expanding our retail capabilities and enhancing the efficiency of our North American portfolio. DP&L's retail power marketing business, DPLER and MC Squared, are rapidly expanding in markets beyond DP&L's service territory. We are now serving more than 140,000 customers outside of our service area in Dayton, representing annual usage of about 2.5 million megawatt hours. This growth more than offset 70,000 customers and 2.1 million megawatt hours that have switched to unaffiliated third parties on DP&L's system. Overall, for 2012, we're projecting that DP&L's retail business will serve approximately 200,000 customers, with combined annual retail sales of 8 million megawatt hours. In terms of reducing cost, AES is on track to achieve nearly $10 million in synergy savings across its North American portfolio businesses this year, and we are aggressively pursuing additional opportunities.
Moving to Slide 11. We're seeing positive momentum at some of our other businesses in the portfolio. For example, in the Philippines, our Masinloc plant achieved record performance in May and June. We have seen similar trend at our Kilroot plant in Northern Ireland, and we have benefited from lower coal prices.
Overall, while the last -- while in the last quarter we faced headwinds at some of our businesses, given the results of our portfolio, year-to-date, we are confident that we can deliver on our adjusted EPS and proportional cash flow guidance for 2012, which, as you know, represents a roughly 20% increase over 2011. Looking beyond 2012, as I discussed on our last call, we faced some challenges in 2013, including low capacity and natural gas prices at DP&L. In 2014 and '15, we see favorable trends, including improved capacity prices in PJM, greater demand growth in key markets such as Brazil, Chile and Colombia, improved earnings from our wind portfolio, contributions from our current construction projects and value creation through our capital allocation decisions.
Over the medium term, we remain optimistic about our earnings trajectory and business prospects. The new capital allocation strategy has improved returns on new projects by focusing on utilizing trapped cash and local leverage capacity and expanding on existing platform. We're focusing on those platform expansion projects that require little equity from AES and shorter lead times to make the greatest contribution to the bottom line. Some near-term examples of these types of projects include Tomhita [ph] 20-megawatt small hydro facility related to our 1,000-megawatt Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, and the 52 megawatts of lithium ion battery facilities colocated with the Angamos and Deepwater plants. Another potential project is the closing of the open cycle at the Los Mina plant and making greater use of our Andres [indiscernible] facility in the Dominican Republic. All of these projects would be constructed relatively quickly, require less equity from AES and would generate earnings faster than greenfield construction.
As far as 2013 is concerned, we will issue guidance no later than the fourth quarter earnings call.
Now Mary will review the drivers of our quarterly results and our 2012 guidance in more detail. Mary?"

This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: first, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and",1335,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: first, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and free cash flow; second, parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.18 of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and $0.55 for the first half of 2012. With our first half results, we are still in line with our internal expectations for the full year. Later in my remarks, I will walk through what we see as the key drivers of adjusted EPS for the second half of this year and why we believe that full year results will still be in line with our guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 although at the lower end.
Before covering the results in more detail, I would like to provide some perspective on the year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS we experienced this quarter. First, during the second quarter of 2011, Gener in Chile had a strong quarter due to significant spot sales at favorable prices. We did not expect that opportunity to reoccur in 2012 and we projected lower results from this business in the second quarter of this year. Gener also had some planned and unplanned outages at its coal-fired facilities during the second quarter of this year. The lower volume also contributed to the year-over-year trend. All affected plants are back on line and performing in line with our expectations. Second, our quarterly results include an additional and final adjustment to the new tariff for Eletropaulo recently approved by the regulator, which was a tougher outcome than anticipated and required a catch-up accrual. These factors affecting 2 of our more significant businesses explain much of the year-over-year decline. These headwinds were partially offset by contributions from our new businesses, which are expected to continue to make significant year-over-year contributions in the second half of 2012.
Now turning to Slide 13. Our proportional gross margin decreased by $56 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. Gener recorded a reduction of $60 million, approximately half due to lower spot sales and half due to lower plant availability. The proportional gross margin impact of the Eletropaulo tariff reset was $35 million for the quarter, including a catch-up accrual of $12 million. This represents the final adjustment for the tariff decision as we have been accruing for the outcome since the third quarter of 2011. In addition, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates had an impact of $20 million. These trends were partially offset by the contributions of new businesses in the United States, Bulgaria and Latin America.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share on Slide 14. Second quarter results decreased by $0.11 to $0.18. Gener in Chile accounted for $0.07 of the decline. Eletropaolo, primarily due to the final tariff reset, represented $0.04 of the reduction. Offsetting these declines, new businesses contributed $0.04 during the quarter. A reduction in SG&A also added $0.02 for the quarter. Foreign exchange headwinds reduced adjusted EPS by $0.02 for the quarter, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, which has depreciated by 19%. Together, the operating drivers accounted for $0.07 of the decline. In terms of non-operating drivers, the quarterly effective tax rate was higher than the rate from a year earlier due in part to a change in the book income mix, which resulted in a $0.03 reduction year-over-year. We expect a reduction in the effective tax rate on a full year basis.
Now turning to cash flow on Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased 44% compared to the second quarter of 2011. This was driven by contributions from new businesses and a higher cash flow from Latin American generation due to improved working capital, partially offset by a decline at Eletropaulo adjusted for a 16% ownership stake.
Now I will review our parent liquidity as of the end of June on Slide 16. During the quarter, we benefited from $677 million of inflow from asset sales and cash from our subsidiaries. During the quarter, we invested $230 million in share repurchases. After $323 million of corporate interest, overhead and investment, we ended the second quarter with more than $1 billion of parent liquidity, up from $911 million at the end of the first quarter. We are pleased with our operating performance that provides us ample liquidity to increase value for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Although we have faced significant headwinds, we expect to offset most of these with new businesses, operational improvement, cost reductions and capital allocation initiatives that we have been discussing in the last few quarters. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance although we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range. Next, I will review the specific drivers of our second half 2012 performance and how we expect to achieve our adjusted EPS target, the year-over-year changes in our businesses, as well as proactive steps that we have taken to improve our earnings. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pro forma adjusted EPS was $0.56 in the second half of 2011, excluding the pre-closing interest cost from the $2 billion of parent debt that we issued to fund the acquisition of DP&L. We believe that the performance of our businesses will be largely consistent with the second half of 2011. Beyond this, we expect to generate an additional $0.11 to $0.15 of earnings, with approximately 70% or $0.09 of this expected increase, driven by contributions from new businesses. As a reminder, Maritza, Changuinola and Angamos achieved full commercial operations late in the second half of 2011. DP&L was acquired in late November. In addition, our key initiatives, such as cost cutting, operational improvements and capital allocation, are expected to contribute roughly $0.06. These gains are partially offset by year-over-year commodity and foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $0.03 to $0.04.  The $0.11 to $0.15 of improvement that we are targeting in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2011 just put us in the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for the year. Although we expect the third and fourth quarters of 2012 to record gains year-over-year, the second half increase is more weighted towards the fourth quarter.
As discussed on our last call, our guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision, originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. Based on actions taken last Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee, which voted for a 2-year extension, we continue to expect that this will occur. If the CFC look-through rule is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion. Overall, we continue to project the tax rate in the low 30% range, generally in line with the rate we recorded in 2011.
Turning to our cash flow guidance on Slide 19. As we discussed on our last call, we expect our full year results to achieve the lower end of our range on proportional free cash flow primarily as the result of working capital changes and assets sold this year. We are also now guiding to the lower end of our range on subsidiary distributions as we may elect to retain some operating cash at our key platform businesses, such as Gener, for tax-efficient investment purposes. In summary, we are pulling all the levers available to us to meet our guidance despite the headwinds that we experienced in the last quarter.
Andres will now address our plans for capital allocation for the second half of 2012."

This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 61% to strengthening our balance sheet. We have used another $145 million or 9% for the joint venture in Turkey and wind projects in the U.K. and Poland to realize the value of recent pipeline acquisitions.  We expect to invest an additional $132 million in other growth opportunities during the second half of the year. This leaves us with roughly $350 million of discretionary cash that we have not yet allocated. We will continue to update you on our capital allocation plan as we receive the cash later this year.
Turning to Slide 21. In terms of future growth, our construction program remains on schedule. Construction work at our 270-megawatt Campiche project in Chile is progressing well, and it's expected to commence operations in early 2013. The Kribi project, a 216-megawatt power plant in Cameroon, is also expected to come online in 2013. Additionally, the 1,200-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam is scheduled for commercial operations in 2015, and civil and construction works are underway at the site. As a reminder, we have already made the necessary equity contributions and have committed nonrecourse debt financing for all of these construction projects.
In terms of future value creation, we will continue to focus on those markets and platforms where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. To that end, we're making progress on our advanced development pipelines in Chile, Colombia and the U.S. In Chile, we have the Cochrane project, a 532-megawatt expansion adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos plant. We're also progressing on Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro near Santiago that builds upon our existing Alpalpal [ph] facility. In the U.S., we will grow our platform at Indianapolis Power & Light with investment in environmental control in some of our coal-fired generation units that will earn regulated returns. Outside of the 3 biggest markets, we also see growth opportunities in the Philippines and India. We are working on Masinloc 2, a brownfield expansion of our very successful Masinloc plant in the Philippines. In India, we're pursuing an expansion of our OPGC facility and expect to be able to fund a substantial portion of our equity with local liquidity. In all development projects, we will utilize the most capital-efficient funding sources, including local cash generation and leverage capacity wherever possible to reduce the required AES equity contribution and improve AES' capital efficiency. 
In closing, we believe that the successful execution of our strategy, consisting of disciplined capital allocation, platform expansions, cost cutting and efficiency initiatives, will allow us to create more value for our shareholders. With respect to the second half of 2012, we expect the contributions from our new plants and businesses, which came online late last year with better plant availability in Chile, will deliver strong growth this year. In summary, we expect to meet our commitment and achieve our adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance for 2012.
I look forward to visiting many of you with our newly appointed CFO, Tom O'Flynn, in the near future. Operator, we will now open the line for questions."

There is not much in terms of new projects coming on until '15 when 1,200 megawatts comes on. So when we look at that trajectory, '12 through '15 -- I want to get a sense from you. To me, buyback and debt reduction seemed to be the biggest tool available in your arsenal to achieve that. And I'm just wondering how you think about that and how aggressively should we be thinking about that buyback and debt reduction program for you over the next 3 years."

First, we do have some of the investments we're making in the smaller platform expansions, whether it be at Tomhita [ph], whether it be battery storage, whether it be closing a site. Those things will come on much faster than -- will come online in that period. Also, realize that from an earnings perspective, due to the nature of the tax equity financing at our U.S. wind businesses, we have a substantial pickup in '14 and '15 in terms of earnings. So we do have those things coming on. We also expect more, say, demand growth in some of the markets. We know that there are better capacity prices in PJM, which will also be a big pickup. So it's not that we're just going to be relying on share buyback. I also think that we will have full years of the earning -- of the, sorry, cost saving from the programs that we implemented this year and next in terms of becoming more efficient, in terms of SG&A and other factors of cost. Because we are really looking at cost across our portfolio. So in the $65 million that we're talking about, that's really at the parent level. That does not include, for example, the efficiency initiatives on our North American portfolio. That does not include initiatives in Brazil, in other markets. And so we do have -- in a lot of those areas, we are, I'd say, about halfway through some of those programs and we'll plan to accelerate them in the remainder of this year and next."

Going forward, what we will be looking at is those things that really help us have a more focused portfolio, as well as help us reduce the cost of some of the support services that we have. And there are also businesses from which we think we cannot grow. So you're correct in the sense that we had looked at renewables because they were low on earnings as we said that -- but, for example, if we look at U.S. wind today, we do really have that pickup in '14, '15, if it's in terms of our earnings. We also do have our solar joint venture with Riverstone, and we'll be looking together ways of monetizing that over the future. So I wouldn't like to get in -- to give specific cases prior to really having something concrete. But we are not really changing from our original position. I think we're executing well, but we're not going to do fire sales. We're going to make sure that we sell the assets in the right form to maximize price. For example, our China asset, there's one case where we did receive bids for it as one package and we realized we could do much better by selling it apart. And the difference is not attributable [ph], like $30 million. So we'll continue to execute, but we're going to do it in a prudent fashion."

This is a normal process in Brazil after a tough [ph] -- really, a review of things or errors or administrative procedure that may have gone wrong. In our administrative filing, which was filed shortly after the case came out, we basically raised 2 key points: One was the removal from the shielded asset -- excuse me, the shielded rate asset base of 2007 to 2011, of this particular cable. We believe that's a procedural and administrative violation to go in and take things out of a shielded asset -- shielded rate asset base, as well as the loss benchmark that Andres had referred to earlier. In Brazil, this loss benchmark is used for over 40% of the distribution businesses and are now -- that shows that statistically, the benchmark was an outlier. And therefore, we're appealing for both of those. The process for that, if there were to be a change or any benefit that would come out of that, it probably would be applied at the time of the next half adjustment, which we would be July 2013 and be retroactive back to July 2011. We have done this in the past. We have had some movement. But given the size of the issues here, I don't want to raise false expectations but we've already taken that action. Finally, at the end of that, should we still be concerned about the outcome, we always have the right, as any Brazilian company would, to appeal it to the Supreme Court.

We did develop the telecoms outside of Eletropaulo. And we also have the footprint in the south in the business of Sul. So our footprint in Brazil is more than just Eletropaulo. We are one of the players there. And we do have the capacity to grow. And we do have now very good relations with BNDES and can finance new projects. We will do projects, of course, that are good projects. So that's -- we have the capacity for growth, but we're making sure that we grow from good projects. Regarding Eletropaulo, we have in effect and then a process of reducing our position there since 2006. We sold down half of our holdings and we took out the telco. So the important thing for us is Eletropaulo is more -- we felt more regulatory challenges than our other businesses there. And that given -- we have, I think, given what we could do, we've managed it as well as possible. So right now, what we're focusing on is making sure that we make it as profitable as possible within the new guideline. And this is our second major cost efficiency program that we're doing and that's creating value. We had done one prior to that. So I guess, in a nutshell, we still see Brazil as an interesting market. We still have the critical footprint.

And yet, Ohio power prices are actually flat to slightly down. And how that ties into your visibility about profitability of the business?"

Regarding the second, in terms of power prices in Ohio and the relationship to natural gas, what we're saying is that basically, DP&L's fleet is coal for the most part -- and it's scrap coal for the most part. But nonetheless, it's competing with gas on the margin. So that is one of the things that's affecting the profitability of those plants going forward. It's the same case, for example, due to a much lesser extent in IPL in the sense that we do sell into the wholesale market and we do have coal plants which are competing with coal. I don't know if Andy would like to add some color to so some of the questions that were asked."

I think you probably all are aware that the procedural schedule was on hold. Today would have been the date that interveners would have to file testimony, and August 27 was the last date for the evidentiary hearing, which would have signaled the end of the settlement process. By petition of the parties, the schedule has been suspended because -- the fact is everybody is working very hard to bring this to settlement. So I'd probably say that there's still a desire by all parties, all 26 parties, some of whom are our competitors, that a settlement be reached and we are still hopeful, as Andres said in his opening remarks, end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter. And I think the suspension of the settlement -- I mean, of the schedule is a signal that knowing there is no new schedule. And the only time when you schedule, we put into place that the parties basically say they cannot get to a settlement. They are still on the settlement path. I think on the other side, going into 2013, the foreign currency with 2013 on average were about $2.50 plus. That's the low for that business given the range of outcome. We're hopeful as we get into 2014, with the pickup of capacity prices and continually strengthening of the gas curves, we'll see this business start to take a much more positive trend as we've said in the past call."

Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased to announce that Tom O'Flynn will be joining us as our new CFO in September. Tom is a great addition to our management team and brings a strong combination of financial skills, senior corporate experience and extensive knowledge of the energy and infrastructure sectors. I'm looking forward to working with Tom to execute on our plans to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. I would also like to take a moment to thank Mary Wood for doing a great job as Interim CFO over the past 90 days. Once Tom is on board, Mary will resume her prior position in the finance organization as our Controller.
Now as you might have seen in our press release, we earned $0.18 of adjusted EPS for the second quarter. And although this is below last year's level, our result, year-to-date, of $0.55 are in line with our commitment to our full year guidance. Mary will walk you through the specific drivers later in this call.
Turning to Slide 3. I will provide you with an update on the strategic plan that we laid out late last year to unlock shareholder value. I will then discuss some of the key macro trends affecting the portfolio, as well as recent developments at our more significant businesses. And following Mary's review of our financial results, I will discuss our capital allocation planned for the remainder of the year.
Moving to Slide 4. And just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for unlocking shareholder value are: one, optimizing capital allocation; two, growing the profitability of the existing portfolio; and three, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets. We feel we're making good progress on executing on the strategic plans we laid out. Regarding the narrowing of our geographic focus, we have raised $800 million through asset sales, exited several non-core markets and invested most of these proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet. At the same time, we're improving the profitability of our business by cutting cost, exploiting scale in synergies and making high return investments based on our existing platforms.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let me provide some color on how we're optimizing our capital allocation and considering all uses of discretionary tax, including delevering, share repurchases, growth project and increases in our dividend to improve our total shareholder return. Over the last 9 months, we have made early repayment on approximately $500 million of debt between repaying the corporate revolver and paying down the expensive debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary in Brazil. With respect to share repurchases, since our last call, we have bought back more than 20 million shares for a total investment of $252 million. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since September to 29 million shares or about 4% of those outstanding. Our total investment in our stock since September is more than $341 million, implying an average purchase price of $11.57 per share. Additionally, last week, the board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, our first cash dividend payment in almost 20 years. We expect to grow the dividend over time in accordance with the performance of the company and market conditions. The dividend is and will remain an integral part of our total value proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 6. And let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. We've committed to achieving $50 million of cost savings at the parent level in 2012 and a total of $100 million in cost savings per year by the end of 2013. For 2012, we expect to exceed our target and are now projecting at least $65 million in savings this year as we've already reduced SG&A by $31 million during the first 6 months.
Moving to Slide 7. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through the asset sale program. Despite a challenging market, we have closed or signed additional deals, such as our French win and China portfolios for additional proceeds of $176 million. To date, we've closed our ninth asset sale since September for cumulative proceeds to AES of $932 million. Thus far, we've achieved attractive valuations for these assets with an average P/E multiple of more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. In summary, we believe that we're consistently executing on the plan that we laid out last November.
Next, on Slide 8, I'd like to briefly discuss important macroeconomic trends affecting our portfolio. We have seen a weakening of GDP growth in some of our markets, including Brazil, where the current year GDP growth rate is expected to be about 2% versus prior expectations of 4%. This is also reflected in a 19% year-over-year depreciation of the Brazilian real. Demand for electric power at Eletropaulo in Brazil this year is expected to grow only about 1%. Nonetheless, over the medium term, we expect growth in Brazil to recover to closer to 4% level and demand for power to grow in line with GDP. In many of our other markets, we are seeing more robust economic growth. For example, Chile and Colombia's economies are growing at nearly 5%, with power demand increasing at up to 7% on some of the grids. Regarding our key markets in the U.S., Ohio's economy is expected to grow in line with the overall U.S. economy at about 2%, while Indiana is slightly lower at about 1%. This year, power demand is increasing at roughly 1% to 1.5% at our Midwestern utilities and most forecasts expect a slight pickup next year.
Generally speaking, weaker commodity prices have negatively affected our results year-to-date. On the natural gas front, while we have seen a modest supply side correction and a fall in the gas-only rig count, prices remain near the $3 per million BTU range, a result at both of our utilities in the U.S. but much more so at DP&L or positively correlated to U.S. natural gas price. Regarding oil and coal prices, both have weakened over the past quarter. In broad brush strokes, although our portfolio is roughly 1/3 hydro and renewables, 1/3 natural gas and 1/3 coal, our results are positively correlated to oil price directly in those markets where fuel oil or diesel set the marginal price and in others where it is set by natural gas or LNG linked to oil prices. On the other hand, AES' results are negatively correlated to coal prices, and we're starting to see the benefit from recent price declines. Today, we're in a buyer's market, and we are leveraging our aggregated annual spend of nearly $2 billion on solid fuels to lock in attractive prices for the remainder of the year. To summarize, while both currency and commodity prices have rebounded slightly as of late, current forward curves still imply a negative EPS impact of around $0.04 relative to where forward curves were as of March 31. Despite this, we've taken the necessary actions to maintain our adjusted earnings per share forecast within our original guidance range.
Now I would like to give you an update on some of recent developments at our more prominent businesses. Let's start with Eletropaulo on Slide 9. ANEEL, the electricity regulator in Brazil, issued the final ruling on Eletropaulo's tariff reset on July 2. The final tariff reset represented a larger decline than the April preliminary proposal and is thus more negative than we had expected. The variance in the final ruling compared to the April proposal was mainly attributable to the change in the benchmark used to determine the level of non-technical energy losses included in the tariff. It is important to mention that we have a positive track record of improving Eletropaulo's operation through reduced energy losses, cost management and revenue enhancement. Since 2010, AES Brazil has implemented the creating value program, which has contributed approximately BRL 325 million or about $160 million to the bottom line through greater productivity and efficiency. Although we are disappointed with the regulatory outcome at Eletropaulo, I would like to point out that our 2 other Brazilian businesses, Tietê and Sul, are performing in line with expectations. These 2 businesses represent more than 80% of our earnings from Brazil as we only own 16% of Eletropaulo.
Now turning to Slide 10. I'd like to give you an update on DP&L. The business continues to perform this year in line with our expectations. In terms of customer switching, at the end of June, 56% of the load had switched to competitive providers, up 3% from the end of March. I would like to highlight that DPLER, our retail arm, captured more than 78% of the switched load through the second quarter. As you know, DP&L's current rate plan is set to expire on December 31, 2012. In March, DP&L filed for approval of its next standard service offering in the form of a market rate offer, or MRO, to determine its tariff for 2013 and beyond. At this point, we're in the midst of settlement discussion. The process is constructive but complex given the number of interveners and the diversity of positions. Combined with continued low natural gas prices, some of the potential regulatory outcome that have been proposed by various interveners could result in lower medium-term earnings and cash flows from this business. We continue to work towards an outcome that is fair and reasonable for all stakeholders, and we remain hopeful that we will have a resolution in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Overall contributions from this business will depend heavily on the final outcome of the MRO.
In the meantime, we're positioning this business for our success in the competitive marketplace by expanding our retail capabilities and enhancing the efficiency of our North American portfolio. DP&L's retail power marketing business, DPLER and MC Squared, are rapidly expanding in markets beyond DP&L's service territory. We are now serving more than 140,000 customers outside of our service area in Dayton, representing annual usage of about 2.5 million megawatt hours. This growth more than offsets 70,000 customers and 2.1 million megawatt hours that have switched to unaffiliated third parties on DP&L's system. Overall, for 2012, we're projecting that DP&L's retail business will serve approximately 200,000 customers, with combined annual retail sales of 8 million megawatt hours. In terms of reducing cost, AES is on track to achieve nearly $10 million in synergy savings across its North American portfolio businesses this year, and we are aggressively pursuing additional opportunities.
Moving to Slide 11. We're seeing positive momentum at some of our other businesses in the portfolio. For example, in the Philippines, our Masinloc plant achieved record performance in May and June. We have seen similar trends at our Kilroot plant in Northern Ireland, where we have benefited from lower coal prices.
Overall, while the last -- while in the last quarter we faced headwinds at some of our businesses, given the results of our portfolio, year-to-date, we are confident that we can deliver on our adjusted EPS and proportional cash flow guidance for 2012, which, as you know, represents a roughly 20% increase over 2011. Looking beyond 2012, as I discussed on our last call, we faced some challenges in 2013, including low capacity and natural gas prices at DP&L. In 2014 and '15, we see favorable trends, including improved capacity prices in PJM, greater demand growth in key markets such as Brazil, Chile and Colombia, improved earnings from our wind portfolio, contributions from our current construction projects and value creation through our capital allocation decisions.
Over the medium term, we remain optimistic about our earnings trajectory and business prospects. The new capital allocation strategy has improved returns on new projects by focusing on utilizing trapped cash and local leverage capacity and expanding on existing platform. We're focusing on those platform expansion projects that require little equity from AES, have shorter lead times and make the greatest contribution to the bottom line. Some near-term examples of these types of projects include Tunhita [ph], a 20-megawatt small hydro facility related to our 1,000-megawatt Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, and the 52 megawatts of lithium ion battery facilities colocated with the Angamos and Deepwater plants. Another potential project is the closing of the open cycle at the Los Mina plant and making greater use of our Andres regassification facility in the Dominican Republic. All of these projects could be constructed relatively quickly, require less equity from AES and would generate earnings faster than greenfield construction.
As far as 2013 is concerned, we will issue guidance no later than the fourth quarter earnings call.
Now Mary will review the drivers of our quarterly results and our 2012 guidance in more detail. Mary?"

This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: first, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and",1338,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: first, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and free cash flow; second, parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.
As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.18 of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and $0.55 for the first half of 2012. With our first half results, we are still in line with our internal expectations for the full year. Later in my remarks, I will walk through what we see as the key drivers of adjusted EPS for the second half of this year and why we believe that full year results will still be in line with our guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 although at the lower end.
Before covering the results in more detail, I would like to provide some perspective on the year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS we experienced this quarter. First, during the second quarter of 2011, Gener in Chile had a strong quarter due to significant spot sales at favorable prices. We did not expect that opportunity to reoccur in 2012 so we projected lower results from this business in the second quarter of this year. Gener also had some planned and unplanned outages at its coal-fired facilities during the second quarter of this year. The lower volume also contributed to the year-over-year trend. All affected plants are back on line and performing in line with our expectation. Second, our quarterly results include an additional and final adjustment to the new tariff for Eletropaulo recently approved by the regulator, which was a tougher outcome than anticipated and required a catch-up accrual. These factors affecting 2 of our more significant businesses explain much of the year-over-year decline. These headwinds were partially offset by contributions from our new businesses, which are expected to continue to make significant year-over-year contributions in the second half of 2012.
Now turning to Slide 13. Our proportional gross margin decreased by $56 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. Gener recorded a reduction of $60 million, approximately half due to lower spot sales and half due to lower plant availability. The proportional gross margin impact of the Eletropaulo tariff reset was $35 million for the quarter, including a catch-up accrual of $12 million. This represents the final adjustment for the tariff decision as we have been accruing for the outcome since the third quarter of 2011. In addition, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates had an impact of $20 million. These trends were partially offset by the contributions of new businesses in the United States, Bulgaria and Latin America.
Turning to adjusted earnings per share on Slide 14. Second quarter results decreased by $0.11 to $0.18. Gener in Chile accounted for $0.07 of the decline. Eletropaolo, primarily due to the final tariff reset, represented $0.04 of the reduction. Offsetting these declines, new businesses contributed $0.04 during the quarter. A reduction in SG&A also added $0.02 for the quarter. Foreign exchange headwinds reduced adjusted EPS by $0.02 for the quarter, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, which has depreciated by 19%. Together, the operating drivers accounted for $0.07 of the decline. In terms of non-operating drivers, the quarterly effective tax rate was higher than the rate from a year earlier due in part to a change in the book income mix, which resulted in a $0.03 reduction year-over-year. We expect a reduction in the effective tax rate on a full year basis.
Now turning to cash flow on Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased 44% compared to the second quarter of 2011. This was driven by contributions from new businesses and a higher cash flow from Latin American generation due to improved working capital, partially offset by a decline at Eletropaulo adjusted for a 16% ownership stake.
Now I will review our parent liquidity as of the end of June on Slide 16. During the quarter, we benefited from $677 million of inflows from our asset sales and cash from our subsidiaries. During the quarter, we invested $230 million in share repurchases. After $323 million of corporate interest, overhead and investment, we ended the second quarter with more than $1 billion of parent liquidity, up from $911 million at the end of the first quarter. We are pleased with our operating performance that provides us ample liquidity to increase value for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Although we have faced significant headwinds, we expect to offset most of these with new businesses, operational improvement, cost reductions and capital allocation initiatives that we have been discussing for the last few quarters. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance although we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range. Next, I will review the specific drivers of our second half 2012 performance and how we expect to achieve our adjusted EPS target, through year-over-year changes in our businesses, as well as proactive steps that we have taken to improve our earnings. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pro forma adjusted EPS was $0.56 in the second half of 2011, excluding the pre-closing interest cost on the $2 billion of parent debt that we issued to fund the acquisition of DP&L. We believe that the performance of our businesses will be largely consistent with the second half of 2011. Beyond this, we expect to generate an additional $0.11 to $0.15 of earnings, with approximately 70% or $0.09 of this expected increase, driven by contributions from new businesses. As a reminder, Maritza, Changuinola and Angamos achieved full commercial operations late in the second half of 2011 and DP&L was acquired in late November. In addition, our key initiatives, such as cost cutting, operational improvements and capital allocation, are expected to contribute roughly $0.06. These gains are partially offset by year-over-year commodity and foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $0.03 to $0.04. The $0.11 to $0.15 of improvement that we are targeting in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2011 should put us in the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for the year. Although we expect both the third and fourth quarters of 2012 to record gains year-over-year, the second half increase is more weighted towards the fourth quarter.
As discussed on our last call, our guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision, originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. Based on actions taken last Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee, which voted for a 2-year extension, we continue to expect that this will occur. If the CFC look-through rule is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion. Overall, we continue to project the tax rate in the low 30% range, generally in line with the rate we recorded in 2011.
Turning to our cash flow guidance on Slide 19. As we discussed on our last call, we expect our full year results to achieve the lower end of our range on proportional free cash flow primarily as the result of working capital changes and assets sold this year. We are also now guiding to the lower end of our range on subsidiary distributions as we may elect to retain some operating cash at our key platform businesses, such as Gener, for tax-efficient investment purposes. In summary, we are pulling all the levers available to us to meet our guidance despite the headwinds that we experienced in the last quarter.
Andres will now address our plans for capital allocation for the second half of 2012."

This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 61% to strengthening our balance sheet. We have used another $145 million or 9% towards our joint venture in Turkey and wind projects in the U.K. and Poland to realize the value of recent pipeline acquisitions. We expect to invest an additional $132 million in other growth opportunities during the second half of the year. This leaves us with roughly $350 million of discretionary cash that we have not yet allocated. We will continue to update you on our capital allocation plan as we receive the cash later this year.
Turning to Slide 21. In terms of future growth, our construction program remains on schedule. Construction work at our 270-megawatt Campiche project in Chile is progressing well, and it's expected to commence operations in early 2013. The Kribi project, a 216-megawatt power plant in Cameroon, is also expected to come online in 2013. Additionally, the 1,200-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam is scheduled for commercial operations in 2015, and civil and construction works are underway at the site. As a reminder, we have already made the necessary equity contributions and have committed nonrecourse debt financing for all of these construction projects.
In terms of future value creation, we will continue to focus on those markets and platforms where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. To that end, we're making progress on our advanced development pipelines in Chile, Colombia and the U.S. In Chile, we have the Cochrane project, a 532-megawatt expansion adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos plant. We're also progressing on Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro near Santiago that builds upon our existing Alpalpal [ph] facility. In the U.S., we will grow our platform at Indianapolis Power & Light with investments in environmental controls at some of our coal-fired generation units that will earn regulated returns. Outside of the 3 biggest markets, we also see growth opportunities in the Philippines and India. We are working on Masinloc 2, a brownfield expansion of our very successful Masinloc plant in the Philippines. In India, we're pursuing an expansion of our OPGC facility and expect to be able to fund a substantial portion of our equity with local liquidity. For all development projects, we will utilize the most capital-efficient funding sources, including local cash generation and leverage capacity wherever possible to reduce the required AES equity contribution and improve AES' capital efficiency. 
In closing, we believe that the successful execution of our strategy, consisting of disciplined capital allocation, platform expansions, cost cutting and efficiency initiatives, will allow us to create more value for our shareholders. With respect to the second half of 2012, we expect the contributions from our new plants and businesses, which came online late last year, plus better plant availability in Chile, will deliver strong growth this year. In summary, we expect to meet our commitment and achieve our adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance for 2012.
I look forward to visiting many of you with our newly appointed CFO, Tom O'Flynn, in the near future. Operator, we will now open the line for questions."

Also, realize that from an earnings perspective, due to the nature of the tax equity financing at our U.S. wind businesses, we have a substantial pickup in '14 and '15 in terms of earnings. So we do have those things coming on. We also expect more, say, demand growth in some of the markets. We know that there are better capacity prices in PJM, which will also be a big pickup. So it's not that we're just going to be relying on share buyback. I also think that we will have full years of the earning -- of the, sorry, cost savings from the programs that we implemented this year and next in terms of becoming more efficient, in terms of SG&A and other factors of cost. Because we are really looking at cost across our portfolio. So in the $65 million that we're talking about, that's really at the parent level. That does not include, for example, the efficiency initiatives on our North American portfolio. That does not include initiatives in Brazil, in other markets.

So you're correct in the sense that we had looked at renewables because they were low on earnings as we said that -- but, for example, if we look at U.S. wind today, we do really have that pickup in '14, '15, that's in terms of our earnings. We also do have our solar joint venture with Riverstone, and we'll be looking together ways of monetizing that over the future. So I wouldn't like to get into give specific cases prior to really having something concrete. But we are not really changing from our original position. I think we're executing well, but we're not going to do fire sales. We're going to make sure that we sell the assets in the right form to maximize price. For example, our China asset, there's one case where we did receive bids for it as one package and we realized we could do much better by selling it apart.

And we've actually taken the first step, which is to file for an administrative appeal and review. This is a normal process in Brazil after a tap [ph] -- really, to review things of errors or administrative procedural that may have gone wrong. In our administrative filing, which was filed shortly after the case came out, we basically raised 2 key points: One was the removal from the shielded asset -- excuse me, the shielded rate asset base of 2007 to 2011, of these particular cables. We believe that's a procedural and administrative violation to go in and take things out of a shielded asset -- shielded rate asset base, as well as the loss benchmark that Andres had referred to earlier. In Brazil, this loss benchmark is used for over 40% of the distribution businesses and our analysis shows that statistically, the benchmark was an outlier. And therefore, we're appealing both of those. The process for that is if there were to be a change or any benefit that would come out of that, it probably would be applied at the time of the next half adjustment, which would be July 2013 and be retroactive back to July 2011. We have done this in the past and we have had some movement. But given the size of the issues here, I don't want to raise false expectations but we've already taken that action.

I mean, we have -- in terms of the large markets where we're present, Brazil is a market with a rapidly growing energy demand and where we had a very substantial footprint. We still have a lot of unlevered capacity -- or leveraged capacity at Tietê, which is a contracted 3,000 megawatts of hydro. When we look at what Eletropaulo -- we do own 16%. We did develop the telecoms outside of Eletropaulo. And we also have the footprint in the south in the business of Sul. So our footprint in Brazil is more than just Eletropaulo. We are one of the players there. And we do have the capacity to grow. And we do have now very good relations with BNDES and can finance new projects. We will do projects, of course, that are good projects. So that's -- we have the capacity for growth, but we're making sure that we grow from good projects. Regarding Eletropaulo, we have in effect been in a process of reducing our position there since 2006. We sold down half of our holdings and we took out the telco. So the important thing for us is Eletropaulo is more -- it had, we felt, more regulatory challenges than our other businesses there. And that given -- we have, I think, given what we could do, we've managed it as well as possible. So right now, what we're focusing on is making sure that we make it as profitable a business as possible within the new guidelines. And this is our second major cost efficiency program that we're doing and that's creating value. We had done one prior to that. So I guess, in a nutshell, we still see Brazil as an interesting market. We still have the critical footprint. And we still have the unused leverage at Tietê, which are the things that we'd be focusing on. Eletropaulo has been challenging, and we've done everything we can to restore profitability of that business."

So I would probably say that there's still a desire by all parties, all 26 parties, some of whom are our competitors, that a settlement be reached and we are still hopeful, as Andres said in his opening remarks, end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter. And I think the suspension of the settlement -- I mean, of the schedule is a signal that, no, there is no new schedule. And the only time a new schedule will be put into place if the parties basically say they cannot get to a settlement. So we're still on the settlement path. I think on the other side, going into 2013, the forward curves with 2013 on average are about $2.50-plus. That's still low for that business given the range of outcomes.

Now turning to the third quarter results, I'm pleased to say that our financial performance this quarter improved over both the second quarter of this year, as well as the third quarter of 2011. This was expected and keeps us on track for our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.36 in the third quarter brings our year-to-date total to $0.91, which is $0.10 higher than what we earned in the first 9 months of 2011. The story is similar for our cash flow metrics. All in all, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance commitments for 2012.

These changes are in line with our strategy and built on the cost savings that we had implemented over the past year. I will discuss the financial benefits of this reorganization in some detail later on in my remarks.
Today, I'd like to focus on 2 main topics: First, an update on recent development in our core markets including DPL in the U.S., Brazil and Chile; and second, progress on our strategic plan to unlock shareholder value, including deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and improving profitability. Later, Tom will work you through the specific drivers of our results as well as our near-term outlook.
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to provide you with an update on recent developments at DPL. As we announced last week, we determined that a goodwill impairment of between $1.7 billion and $2 billion of DPL was required. As we have discussed in prior earnings call, the fundamentals of the business have been adversely affected since the acquisition was announced in April 2011. This is primarily the result of sustained lower natural gas prices and more customers moving to competitive retail providers, including our own, have reduced margins. Consequently, forecasted profitability and cash flows are lower resulting in the goodwill impairment in the range we have provided. 
Obviously, we are disappointed with these developments at DPL. That said, we are committed to reaching the most positive regulatory and business outcome possible. To that end, we're working to achieve a reasonable result in the rate case, and we continue to expand our retail customer base inside and outside of DP&L's service territory and we will strengthen DP&L's balance sheet by using its internally generated cash to pay down debt.
Our electric security plan or ESP application is that design to balance DP&L's need to maintain its financial integrity the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's desire for more rapid evolution to market-based rate. If approved, the proposed ESP will allow DP&L to collect a non-bypassable service stability right that will give the company an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity. The approval process is moving forward and the pre-hearings and technical conference have been scheduled for November 9. We are hopeful that the new ESP will be in place by no later than the first quarter of 2013. In the event that a decision or settlement is not reached by the end of 2012, we have also filed a motion with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio requesting an extension of DP&L's current rate until a final decision is reached.
Next, regarding our strategy to grow our retail customer base, we continue to expand our retail load inside and outside of DP&L's service territory in Ohio. Within DP&L's territory, we have retained roughly 75% of switch load although as I said earlier, at significantly lower margins.
The markets outside of DP&L's service territory, both in Ohio and Illinois, our retail business is currently serving more than 150,000 customers. By year's end, we are projecting that DPL's retail business will be serving approximately 200,000 customers, which represent a net increase of approximately 175,000 in the company's total number of customers during 2012. 
Finally, we are working to strengthen DPL's balance sheet through a multi-year deleveraging and refinancing program. In 2012, we expect that DPL will distribute to AES $122 million, of which we've already received $87 million as of the end of September. Over the next couple of years, however, we expect to use essentially all cash generated from operations within the DPL group of companies for debt reduction.
Next, turning to Slide 5 and our businesses in Brazil. As many of you are aware, in order to stimulate the economy, the government of Brazil recently announced an energy cost reduction program or Provisional Measure 579, which targets a 20% reduction in electricity prices. About 1/3 of this planned reduction is expected to be driven by lowering indirect taxes on the sector. The remaining 2/3 of this reduction is being targeted through negotiations with various generators and TND companies, whose concession contracts are up for renewal between 2015 and 2017. These rules are still pending congressional approval and implementation is scheduled for February of 2013. 
I would like to emphasize that the proposed rules are not expected to have any significant impact in the near term on our businesses in Brazil. Let me explain why. Tietê, our main generation business in Brazil, has a long-term concession expiring in 2029 and thus will not be subject to this regulation. Furthermore, we are insulated in the short term as 100% of Tietê's output is contacted with Eletropaulo through December 2015. Beyond 2015, it's still too early to tell what the incremental impact of MP 579 will be on energy prices in Brazil.
As far as the impact on our 2 distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul, we do not expect any meaningful impact on either. Both utilities earn our return on their regular asset base and energy purchases are treated as a cost -- On balance, the Brazilian government's initiative to stimulate economic growth should help increase demand for electricity, which will result in increased revenue for both Eletropaulo and Sul.
Now turning to Slide 6, I would like to give you a brief outlook on ASNL. I'm happy to report that all of our plants are fully available, including those that were offline in the second quarter for repair and maintenance. As discussed in our previous calls, our Angamos plant in the North of Chile is now 90% contracted and therefore it's exposure to low spot prices has been significantly reduced. In addition, we continue to see energy demand growth of between 4% and 6% in Chile. We have also seen positive results at some of our other important businesses, including Masinloc in the Philippines, -- in Bulgaria and south plant in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 7, I would like to provide you with an update on the strategic plan to unlock shareholder value that we laid out late last year. Just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for enhancing shareholder value are: First, optimizing capital allocation; second, improving the profitability of existing portfolio; and third, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets.
Now turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. As we have discussed in the past, our goal is to maximize risk adjusted returns on a per share basis by allocating our discretionary cash across various uses, including deleveraging, share buyback, offering a predictable and growing dividend and investing in platform expansions. Last month, the board approved the prepayment of $225 million of corporate debt, which we expect to complete later this year or early next. This will help us not only lower our interest expense but will also help us with our credit metrics by mitigating the impact of lost earnings in cash flows from assets that we have sold. Once completed, the prepayment will bring our total debt repayments to approximately $717 million since September of 2011, including both corporate level debt and expensive nonrecourse debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary. 
With respect to share repurchases, in the third quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $49 million, representing an average price of $11.38. This brings our total investment in our shares since September of 2011 to $390 million representing nearly 34 million shares or approximately 4% of shares outstanding.
Last but not least, we have also declared our first cash dividend in almost 20 years, which is set to be paid on November 15. The dividend is an important component of our total return proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 9 and let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. As you may recall, in late 2011, we announced an effort to reduce SG&A by $100 million by 2014. For 2012, we're ahead of our original goal of $50 million and we now expect to achieve at least $65 million in cost savings this year. As a result of the recently announced reorganization, we now expect to realize the full $100 million of savings in 2013. Ultimately, the reorganization will result in additional savings of $45 million to achieve a total reduction of $145 million in annual overhead expense relative to 2011. I would like to point out that the cost saving numbers I just mentioned only reflects savings in overhead at the AES level, and they do not include additional cost savings at our businesses, such as Brazil, where we are implementing our program to improve that company's performance by $224 million per year by 2015, of which $150 million will be achieved by the end of 2012. We see additional opportunities for savings in fuel sourcing and in operations and maintenance expenses. For example, we presently purchase $2 billion of coal a year and we're saving about $80 million as a result of implementing a comprehensive global sourcing framework, including the blending of coals and having the ability to redirect coal shipments. However, we believe we have not yet exploited all of the advantages from our global scale and possible synergies and are working hard to do so.
Moving to Slide 10. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales. Last quarter, we announced the sale of our China portfolio. I'm pleased to report that we have closed and received $86 million in the process for 2 of the 3 businesses. We expect the third transaction for $49 million to close within the next few weeks. To date, we have sold 9 assets for $933 million net equity proceeds at an average PE multiple of more than 20. We continue to seek additional opportunities to streamline our portfolio by exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or a strong platform with an opportunity for expansion. Once completed, we expect that this strategy will result in a lower overall risk profile and a more focused and efficient company.
In summary, we believe that we are consistently executing on the plans that we laid out in our first call last November.
Now Tom will review the drivers of our quarterly results, guidance and platform expansion projects in more detail."

Before I get into our results, I would first like to say that I'm very pleased to be here. In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the business. Like any company",1935,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning all. Before I get into our results, I would first like to say that I'm very pleased to be here. In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the business. Like any company, there are a number of exciting aspects and also some challenges. However, I've been impressed by the commitment of our people, as well as the potential for improving our portfolio, delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and the other things that Andres has laid out. 
This morning, beginning on Slide 11, I'll cover the following topics: first, our third quarter results and key drivers of gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax contribution and free cash flow and parent liquidity; second, our near-term capital allocation plans; and finally, an update on our guidance and total return expectations.
As Andres has mentioned, we reported $0.36 of adjusted EPS for the third quarter. This brings our 9-month earnings to $0.91 or about 3/4 at the low end of our full year 2012 guidance.
Now to Slide 12, our proportional gross margin increased by $168 million over the third quarter of 2011. The majority of this increase was driven by new businesses, such as Changuinola in Panama, Angamos in Chile and DPL in the U.S. In addition, we saw a favorable year-over-year trends at several of our larger generation businesses, such as Masinloc in the Philippines and Moritza in Bulgaria. These trends were partially offset by lower tariff rates and higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo in Brazil.
Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 13. Third quarter results increased by $0.08 or 29% to $0.36. This increase was primarily driven by $0.09 of contributions from new businesses I just covered, $0.01 from -- share count and $0.02 from our cost-cutting initiatives, which have lowered SG&A expense by $26 million in third quarter and $57 million year-to-date. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $0.03.
Now to Slide 14. I'd like to review our new earnings metrics we're introducing this quarter. We hear frequently from investors with a large number of businesses can be difficult to determine what is the biggest impact on the bottom line. In an effort to provide additional transparency, we are introducing adjusted pretax contribution, metric that we use internally to measure financial performance. This measure is calculated by taking the pretax earnings from each business, putting those accounted for as equity and earnings and adjusting for our ownership or segments. In addition, we make the same pro forma adjustments that we do for adjusted EPS. 
On Slide 14, we draft the relative contribution to each of our segments have made to year-to-date adjusted PTC of $1.5 billion. As you can see, for example, Latin America generation at 37% is the single largest contributor driven primarily by our generation flip at Chile, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. Our generation businesses in Europe and North America are also significant contributors. 
We measure also highlight of some of our business consolidated results are significantly different than the bottom line impact. This is most notable in Eletropaulo, which we control and consolidate but have an economic interest of only about 16%. As shown on the slide, our utility businesses in Latin America contribute only 8% of adjusted PTC. We hope this additional disclosure will help simplify the AES story and allow you to focus on the biggest value drivers.
Now to Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow is increased $41 million compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven primarily from contributions from new businesses partially offset by a decline in Eletropaulo.
Now on to Slide 16, in parent liquidity. During the quarter, we benefited from $426 million of inflows from asset sales and cash flow from our subsidiaries. Also during quarter, we returned 71 million to shareholders by share repurchases. After $157 million of corporate interest, overhead and investments, we ended the third quarter with more than $1.2 billion of parent liquidity, up from $1 billion at the end of last quarter.
Now to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our plans for capital allocation for the balance of the year. This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 67% to returning cash to shareholders in deleveraging, including the $225 million debt paydown expected later this year or early next. We've allocated another 17% or $262 million to growth investments. The remaining 16% or $258 million of year-end cash will be combined with parent free cash flows in 2013 to be allocated in line with our capital allocation framework.
Now let me take a minute to review a couple of the segments for 2013. On the source side, we expect parent free cash flow to be lower than the 2012 expectations of our $550 million. It'll be due to 2 major factors, the first in DPL and secondly from AES and air and IPL, that those businesses retain some cash to reinvest. In terms of the use of discretionary cash, we expect growth investments to be lower than the 2012 levels of $262 million. These 2013 investments, which could total up to $200 million, are largely impact from expansions that I'll discuss in a moment. 
Regarding the dividend and growth, we expect to evaluate the reasonable list of dividend increases on an annual basis in the beginning of the fourth quarter, consistent with the timing of our annual planning process. We appreciate the value of moving our dividend yield to be more in line with the S&P 500 and we'll factor that into our future deliberations.
Finally, the main cash will be invested in both debt reductions and share repurchases with more weighting towards debt reductions in 2013.
Now to Slide 18. We are reaffirming our 2012 guidance elements that discussed on our last quarter's call. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we expect to come in at the low end of the range of $1.22 to $1.30 adjusted EPS. Operational free cash flow and subsidiary distributions are also expected come in at the low end of our guidance range.
Now to Slide 19 and looking beyond 2012. We expect modest adjusted EPS growth in 2013 compared to our 2012 expectations. This modest growth is largely driven by improved operating performance at AES Gener in Chile, recovery at Eletropaulo in Brazil and the full year benefit in capital allocation and our cost savings initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by lower earnings in DPL and weaker foreign exchange. 
Please keep in mind this is based on foreign exchange and commodities as of September 30, our expectations of near-term regulatory and the current macro outlook each of our key markets. We expect these items change, our guidance could be impacted. This guidance assumes extension of the controlled foreign corporation or CFC provision recently enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. If the CFC tool is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this will be a non-cash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss carryforward of about $2.1 billion. 
Overall, we continue to project tax rate on adjusted earnings in the low 30% range.
Andres has discussed we continue to look for opportunities to streamline our business focus. Although most of our focus to date to have been EPS neutral to accretive, this may be more difficult as we monetize on assets. Prior to releasing a defined 2013 guidance range during our year-end call, we'll have an update view of relevant macro environments and the impact of potential portfolio de-risking activities.
Now to Slide 20. Earlier this year, we introduced a 3-year average annual total return target of 8% to 10% comprise of EPS growth and dividend yield. Since our last earnings call, we made considerable progress in our annual planning process and although not fully complete, it is evidence to us that our earnings growth rate in 2015 will likely be lower than previous estimates. This decline was driven by lower earnings from DPL in 2014 and '15 due to the issues that Andres has covered. We have been anticipating some improvement in DPL which is no longer the case. In addition, the compounding effect that produced cash flow also has an impact.
Secondly, lower-than-expected earnings in Brazil, driven largely by lower demand, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a more negative outcome than expected on the tariff reset in Eletropaulo. These are partially offset by improved performance in our businesses in Chile, IPL in the U.S. and the additional cost savings we recently announced. In light of these factors, we're now expecting an average total return through 2015 of 6% to 8%. We appreciate that this is a difficult provision but believe it is a more appropriate reflection of our current outlook.
Before turning the call back to Andres, I'd like to cover the progress we're making on our almost 1800 megawatts of projects under construction, as well as our platform expansions underdevelopment. Moving to Slide 21, our construction program remains on schedule. In addition, we've already secured the necessary financing and funded 100% of our equity commitments for these projects. In terms of progress on these specific projects, the work at our 270-megawatt coal-fired Campeche project in Chile is progressing well. I was in Chile a couple of weeks ago and had a good first-hand look at the progress. Synchronization of the unit is scheduled for November and commercial operation is expected in early 2013. The project at 216-megawatt gas power plant in Cameroon, we've energized a 60-mile transmission line and plan testing will begin in December. Finally, our 1240-megawatt coal-fired plant in Vietnam is progressing on time and on budget, and operations are expected to begin in 2015. We're especially pleased that this project has surpassed 5 million man-hours without a lost time incident and is achieving world-class EP standards.
Now to Slide 22. In terms of future value creation beyond these construction projects, we continue to move forward on developing powerplants in markets where we have a significant presence in a compelling competitive advantage. Our focus is to use most efficient source of capital, including bringing in strategic partners, using low-cost project financing, multilateral funding and operating cash flows generated at the existing businesses. For example, at Cochran, 530-megawatt coal-fired expansion in our Angamos platform at AES and Gener, we now place and place contract, long-term the majority output and are close to bringing in a strategic partner. We're focused on finalizing project financing and construction is expected to begin in 2013. 
With regard to Alto Maipo, the 530-megawatt under project also at Gener, we successfully executed the principal construction contracts, moved forward works, continue to work remaining project milestones and expect to begin construction also in 2013. Similarly, here in the U.S., we plan to upgrade 100% of baseload coal-fired fleet at IPL with investments in environmental controls to comply with MAPS. This investment will earn regulated returns and will also fulfill a majority of necessary environmental upgrades required for -- at all of our 7000 megawatts of coal-fired generating here in the U.S. We expect this investment to begin second half 2013 carrying on through 2016 with potential equity investment of up to $300 million.
In closing, I look forward to seeing many of you next week in the EI. I'll now turn it back over to Andres."

We're pleased with our third quarter results which are in line with expectations. We're on track to delivering 20% adjusted EPS growth this year in line with our guidance. Despite the challenges we have faced recently, the earning power of the company ring strong and we expect to deliver a 6% to 8% average annual return from 2012 through 2015, including dividend yield and EPS growth. Although we won't be satisfied with this rate of return, we believe it's prudent to lower expectations at this time primarily given lower forecast from DPL and Brazil. But we will, nonetheless, continue to strive for higher total returns for our shareholders. We have taken actions to significantly reduce our overhead and streamline our organization. We will also aggressively pursue additional operating cost savings. We will continue to de-risk the company to deleveraging and narrowing our geographic focus through asset sales and we're committed to pulling all levers to improve risk-adjusted returns from our platform businesses.

In terms of next year, I touched on it briefly but the 550 from the Slide 17 I think it was, will be lower next year really partially because of reduced cash coming from DPL. But also, we're making reinvestments in a couple of businesses. As I mentioned, IPL and secondly, Gener. The number of the-- so we expect that to be lower. We'll give you better idea of what our expectations will be on our year-end call, we'll be giving guidance. I think so the 500-ish range is a more indicative indication of a more normalized number. So this year would be closer to what we think would be a more normalized number. Next year, it'll be lower, below the let's say a 500 normalized number because of reinvestments we're making. In terms of the CapEx, I said up to 200, I do mean up to 200. One of the biggest things, it could be as little as half that amount. One of the issues is Gener has been a great performer for us, a great grower. They are building the 2 projects: coal in and the Hydro. Coal come first, Cochran I've mentioned. That issue was that they will need some equity at the Gener level to do that. And the 200 would contemplates of equity being put in by AES obviously, another alternative is them issuing shares in the market to do that. So well known company, good market cap, trades well, trades better than us. So as one of the things will think about is that the right funding is to the extent that they access the majority of the equity in the markets are so maybe there's splitting the baby concept and that 200 could be as low as 100 to 100 and a quarter. There's something we'll have to give thought to. In terms of go back to the third party question, the 6 -- I thing it's $6.2 billion of parent debt, including some trust preferreds but we will look for coverage ratios. I think we've said that we want to maintain our rating and work it up over time but the coverage ratio we look at in terms of debt to cash flow, can work use the range of 4.5 to 5.5, that continues to be a target that we've got. Near term, we're a little skewed towards the higher end of that range so 2015, some of our cash flow available may be weighted more towards a share repurchase but once again, we see that really as that 2013 only focus. We've got the ability to do both but we really focus kind of bottom-line. We focus on the leverage -- the coverage ratios. As you know, that's a more appropriate condition of credit quality."

So those things get corrected. We also have in terms of some of our wind projects in the U.S. as the tax equity say matures that we will have more earnings from those assets in the U.S. and we'll also have the new plants that have been brought on for the full year. So I think that those are some of the drivers that we have. We can give you perhaps some more specific breakdown of the small plants but it's a different situation than we were this year with a big driver, we had a lot of megawatts coming online at the beginning of the year."

I think that sort of go back to what we laid out, we said we had a universe of about $2 billion of equity in assets that we can sell and so we've executed about half of that and that we would be concentrating on those that weren't sort of platforms for growth that had unused leverage capacity or ability to raise money or really places we didn't feel they had sustainable competitive advantage. So I think we've done that pretty much to date. Now going forward, what we do the same framework is in place, we don't really like to really give specific names because, of course, we're operating these businesses and if we say they are for sale, it makes it more difficult to continue operating them at the optimal level. But again, there would be those where we have like 1 plant, one-off where we don't see a platform of growing. Regarding renewables, we have changed the way we think about most renewables certainly win. We're not thinking about a stand-alone wind business but really thinking of placing wind into sort of geographic units that we have. So wind becomes just another way of providing energy. And what we've seen is we really exploit the sort of platform concept there more successful. If you think of something like battery storage, we are leaders explaining let's say this technology and where we really been successful is where we apply it to our existing businesses. The one exception of this is solar. In solar, we have a 50-50 JV with Riverstone and, of course, both of us will be seeking to monetize this asset over time. But other than that, I really can't give you more specifics but I would say, you should expect over time, a continued asset sales. This will also help us reduce cost, help us reduce our focus and what we'll do is as soon as really have something firm, announce it and make it public but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here."

So that's really what's causing this step down of 2%. But I think that if you think of our portfolio, again, if you take a longer period, we do have very competitive growth rates. I think that we provide the advantages of a diversified portfolio. Obviously, we're concentrated in fewer markets. You have less of this but I do you think and we have said from day one that we do think that we're into many markets and so we do want to focus that we can have all the advantages of the portfolio diversification. We don't have to be in 30 countries as where we started. So yes, do expect us to reduce, do expect us to become more efficient as I think we're doing. I mean, we're -- we've reduced overhead. By next year, we'll be close to 25% and the longer term, it's more like 1/3. And that's just overhead in terms of managing these businesses. So regarding your question, I do think that we will provide compelling returns. We are in the right markets, markets where there's growth. Chile's growing 5% to 6%, Columbia is growing 5% to 6%, panama's growing 8%, even Brazil longer term is expected to be growing at 4% after 1.6% this year.

I think I mentioned on the last cost -- call, what will make us think about whether we need to go into rates or not is how we deal with potential retirements of older coal units. We are looking at and still evaluating whether we may have to retire up to coal orders, more coal units which represent about 15% of our generation. If we do that, we probably will have to bring on new capacity in the self builders through the RFP process that we engaged in earlier. As we come to that decision, we would only be able to recover costs associated with that expansion in a rate case, and that's really what's out there. And as we get further along that process, we'll update you probably in the next call where we are but that's really what Ton was alluding to the potential that if we have to do the retirements and we do added capacity at that point, we will need to consider going through rates so we can recover on that investment."

Now in terms of the sales, I mean we did sell those. I think that we're in a good position to sell for a very good multiples quickly and I think our market timing was very good. Now looking forward, we're going to sell judiciously in the sense that we really want to maximize that the value of this and I can give you just an illustration assume, we could have sold factories to all of our China assets and we did have offers to sell it right away but we took our time and sold those to separate buyers and we received the 40% premium versus the sort of altogether and that's how we're going to continue with these asset sales. So I think when we have several things under discussions and when we really do have something that we can bank on, then we will announce it. So we're working hard on this. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and say that we have something until we actually have it signed. So do I feel that if we reached to, say, $1.7 billion or $1.5 billion, if we got the right price then that's probably the right amount.

We also proposed somewhere to the AEP as a switching tracker so that fundamentally, we would be able to not have to forecast switching where forward but that you would be held sort of neutral to switching return forward to the outcomes of the rate case. That said, most of the battle right now is around residential customers. We have seen an increase in residential customer switching about 2.5% a month. We see an probably around 75% switched. We're seeing most of the category of customers other than residential reaching saturation levels, so that's really what we're seeing. It's mostly been increases organic switching because I think a lot of the aggregate have slowed downed pending the outcome of all the cases and actually the elections that we've just had. So we anticipate that we're going to see continued very intense competition in the residential class. We see that potentially saturated long term at about 80% -- 86% switched. So were competitions intense and, as Andre said, we are replacing more customers and we lost in more load than we've lost. But clearly, it's an extremely competitive environment."

We at AES have done as much as possible to help impacted areas, sending more than half of our available field resources from DP&L and IP&L (sic) [IPL] to help out affected service providers.
Now turning to the third quarter results. I'm pleased to say that our financial performance this quarter improved over both the second quarter of this year as well as the third quarter of 2011. This was expected and keeps us on track for our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.36 in the third quarter brings our year-to-date total to $0.91, which is $0.10 higher than what we earned in the first 9 months of 2011. The story is similar for our cash flow metrics. All in all, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance commitments for 2012.
Additionally, we recently announced organizational changes that will create greater efficiencies by placing functional and operational activities in the right place and eliminating overhead redundancies. These changes are in line with our strategy and build on the cost savings that we had implemented over the past year. I will discuss the financial benefits of this reorganization in some detail later on in my remarks.
Today, I'd like to focus on 2 main topics: first, an update on recent developments in our core markets, including DPL in the U.S., Brazil and Chile; and second, progress on our strategic plans to unlock shareholder value, including deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and improving profitability. Later, Tom will work you through the specific drivers of our results as well as our near-term outlook.
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to provide you with an update on recent developments at DPL. As we announced last week, we determined that a goodwill impairment of between $1.7 billion and $2 billion at DPL was required. As we have discussed on prior earnings call, the fundamentals of the business have been adversely affected since the acquisition was announced in April 2011. This is primarily a result of sustained lower natural gas prices and more customers moving to competitive retail providers, including our own, at reduced margins. Consequently, forecasted profitability and cash flows are lower, resulting in the goodwill impairment in the range we have provided. 
Obviously, we are disappointed with these developments at DPL. That said, we are committed to reaching the most positive regulatory and business outcome possible. To that end, we're working to achieve a reasonable result in the rate case, and we continue to expand our retail customer base inside and outside of DP&L's service territory. And we will strengthen DP&L's balance sheet by using its internally generated cash to pay down debt.
Our Electric Security Plan, or ESP, application is designed to balance DP&L's need to maintain its financial integrity with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's desire for a more rapid evolution to a market-based rate. If approved, the proposed ESP will allow DP&L to collect a non-bypassable Service Stability Rider that will give the company an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity. The approval process is moving forward, and the pre-hearings and technical conference have been scheduled for November 9. We are hopeful that the new ESP will be in place by no later than the first quarter of 2013. In the event that a decision or settlement is not reached by the end of 2012, we have also filed a motion with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio requesting an extension of DP&L's current rate until a final decision is reached.
Next, regarding our strategy to grow our retail customer base, we continue to expand our retail load inside and outside of DP&L's service territory in Ohio. Within DP&L's territory, we have retained roughly 75% of the switch load, although, as I said earlier, at significantly lower margins.
In markets outside of DP&L's service territory, both in Ohio and Illinois, our retail business is currently serving more than 150,000 customers. By year's end, we are projecting that DPL's retail business will be serving approximately 200,000 customers, which represent a net increase of approximately 175,000 in the company's total number of customers during 2012. 
Finally, we are working to strengthen DPL's balance sheet through a multiyear deleveraging and refinancing program. In 2012, we expect that DPL will distribute to AES $122 million, of which we've already received $87 million as of the end of September. Over the next couple of years, however, we expect to use essentially all cash generated from operations within the DPL group of companies for debt reduction.
Next, turning to Slide 5 and our businesses in Brazil. As many of you are aware, in order to stimulate the economy, the Government of Brazil recently announced an energy cost reduction program, or Provisional Measure 579, which targets a 20% reduction in electricity prices. About 1/3 of this planned reduction is expected to be driven by lowering indirect taxes on the sector. The remaining 2/3 of this reduction is being targeted through negotiations with various generators and T&D companies whose concession contracts are up for renewal between 2015 and 2017. These rules are still pending congressional approval, and implementation is scheduled for February of 2013. 
I would like to emphasize that the proposed rules are not expected to have any significant impact in the near term on our businesses in Brazil. Let me explain why. Tietê, our main generation business in Brazil, has a long-term concession expiring in 2029 and thus will not be subject to this regulation. Furthermore, we are insulated in the short term as 100% of Tietê's output is contracted with Eletropaulo through December 2015. Beyond 2015, it's still too early to tell what the incremental impact of MP 579 will be on energy prices in Brazil.
As far as the impact on our 2 distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul, we do not expect any meaningful impact on either. Both utilities earn a return on their regulated asset base, and energy purchases are treated as a cost pass-through. On balance, the Brazilian Government's initiatives to stimulate economic growth should help increase demand for electricity, which will result in increased revenue for both Eletropaulo and Sul.
Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to give you a brief update on AES Gener. I'm happy to report that all of our plants are fully available, including those that were offline in the second quarter for repairs and maintenance. As discussed on our previous calls, our Angamos plant in the north of Chile is now 90% contracted, and, therefore, it's exposure to low spot prices has been significantly reduced. In addition, we continue to see energy demand growth of between 4% and 6% in Chile. We've also seen positive results at some of our other important businesses, including Masinloc in the Philippines, Maritza in Bulgaria and Southland in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 7. I would like to provide you with an update on the strategic plan to unlock shareholder value that we laid out late last year. Just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for enhancing shareholder value are: first, optimizing capital allocation; second, improving the profitability of the existing portfolio; and third, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets.
Now turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. As we have discussed in the past, our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on a per share basis by allocating our discretionary cash across various uses, including deleveraging, share buyback, offering a predictable and growing dividend and investing in platform expansions. Last month, the Board approved the prepayment of $225 million of corporate debt, which we expect to complete later this year or early next. This will help us not only lower our interest expense but will also help us with our credit metrics by mitigating the impact of lost earnings and cash flows from assets that we have sold. Once completed, the prepayment will bring our total debt repayments to approximately $717 million since September of 2011, including both corporate-level debt and expensive nonrecourse debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary. 
With respect to share repurchases, in the third quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $49 million, representing an average price of $11.38. This brings our total investment in our shares since September of 2011 to $390 million, representing nearly 34 million shares or approximately 4% of shares outstanding.
Last but not least, we have also declared our first cash dividend in almost 20 years, which is set to be paid on November 15. The dividend is an important component of our total return proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 9, and let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. As you may recall, in late 2011, we announced an effort to reduce SG&A by $100 million by 2014. For 2012, we're ahead of our original goal of $50 million, and we now expect to achieve at least $65 million in cost savings this year. 
As a result of the recently announced reorganization, we now expect to realize the full $100 million of savings in 2013. Ultimately, the reorganization will result in additional savings of $45 million to achieve a total reduction of $145 million in annual overhead expense relative to 2011. 
I would like to point out that the cost saving numbers I just mentioned only reflects savings in overhead at the AES level, and they do not include additional cost savings at our businesses, such as Brazil, where we are implementing our Creando Valor [ph] program to improve that company's performance by $224 million per year by 2015, of which $150 million will be achieved by the end of 2012. We see additional opportunities for savings in fuel sourcing and in operations and maintenance expenses. For example, we presently purchase $2 billion of coal a year, and we're saving about $80 million as a result of implementing a comprehensive global sourcing framework, including the blending of coals and having the ability to redirect coal shipments. However, we believe we have not yet exploited all of the advantages from our global scale and possible synergies and are working hard to do so.
Moving to Slide 10. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales. Last quarter, we announced the sale of our China portfolio. I'm pleased to report that we have closed and received $86 million in the process for 2 of the 3 businesses. We expect the third transaction for $49 million to close within the next few weeks. To date, we have sold 9 assets for $933 million in net equity proceeds at an average PE multiple of more than 20. We continue to seek additional opportunities to streamline our portfolio by exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or a strong platform with an opportunity for expansion. Once completed, we expect that this strategy will result in a lower overall risk profile and a more focused and efficient company.
In summary, we believe that we are consistently executing on the plans that we laid out in our first call last November.
Now Tom will review the drivers of our quarterly results, guidance and platform expansion projects in more detail."

In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the businesses. Like any company, there are a number of exciting aspects and also some challenges. However, I've been impressed by the commitment of our people as well as the potential for improving our portfolio, delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and the other things that Andres has laid out. 
This morning, beginning on Slide 11, I'll cover the following topics: first, our third quarter results and key drivers of gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax contribution and free cash flow and parent liquidity; second, our near-term capital allocation plans; and finally, an update on our guidance and total return expectations.
As Andres has mentioned, we reported $0.36 of adjusted EPS for the third quarter. This brings our 9-month earnings to $0.91 or about 3/4 of the low end of our full year 2012 guidance.
Now to Slide 12. Our proportional gross margin increased by $168 million over the third quarter of 2011. The majority of this increase was driven by new businesses, such as Changuinola in Panama, Angamos in Chile and DPL in the U.S. In addition, we saw favorable year-over-year trends at several of our larger generation businesses, such as Masinloc in the Philippines and Maritza in Bulgaria. These trends were partially offset by lower tariff rates and higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo in Brazil.
Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 13. Third quarter results increased by $0.08, or 29%, to $0.36. This increase was primarily driven by $0.09 of contributions from new businesses I just covered, $0.01 from lower share count and $0.02 from our cost-cutting initiatives, which have lowered SG&A expense by $26 million in third quarter and $57 million year-to-date. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $0.03.
Now to Slide 14. I'd like to review a new earnings metric we're introducing this quarter. We hear frequently from investors that with a large number of businesses, it can be difficult to determine what has the biggest impact on the bottom line. In an effort to provide additional transparency, we are introducing adjusted pretax contribution, a metric that we use internally to measure financial performance. This measure is calculated by taking the pretax earnings from each business, including those accounted for as equity in earnings, and adjusting for our ownership percentage. In addition, we make the same pro forma adjustments that we do for adjusted EPS. 
On Slide 14, we draft the relative contribution that each of our segments has made to year-to-date adjusted PTC of $1.5 billion. As you can see, for example, Latin America generation at 37% is the single largest contributor driven primarily by our generation fleets at Chile, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. Our generation businesses in Europe and North America were also significant contributors. 
The measure also highlights that some of our businesses' consolidated results are significantly different than their bottom line impact. This is most notable in Eletropaulo, which we control and consolidate but have an economic interest of only about 16%. As shown on the slide, our utility businesses in Latin America contribute only 8% of adjusted PTC. We hope this additional disclosure will help to simplify the AES story and allow you to focus on the biggest value drivers.
Now to Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased $41 million compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses, partially offset by a decline in Eletropaulo.
Now on to Slide 16 and parent liquidity. During the quarter, we benefited from $426 million of inflows from asset sales and cash flow from our subsidiaries. Also during the quarter, we returned $71 million to shareholders via share repurchases. After $157 million of corporate interest, overhead and investments, we ended the third quarter with more than $1.2 billion of parent liquidity, up from $1 billion at the end of last quarter.
Now to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our plans for capital allocation for the balance of the year. This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 67% to returning cash to shareholders and deleveraging, including the $225 million debt paydown expected later this year or early next. We've allocated another 17%, or $262 million, to growth investments. The remaining 16%, or $258 million, of year-end cash will be combined with parent free cash flows in 2013 to be allocated in line with our capital allocation framework.
Now let me take a minute to review a couple of the segments for 2013. On the sources side, we expect parent free cash flow to be lower than the 2012 expectations of $550 million. It'll be due to 2 major factors, the first being DPL and secondly from AES Gener and IPL as those businesses retain some cash to reinvest. In terms of the use of discretionary cash, we expect growth investments to be lower than the 2012 levels of $262 million. These 2013 investments, which could total up to $200 million, are largely in fact from expansions that I'll discuss in a moment. 
Regarding the dividend and growth, we expect to evaluate the reasonableness of dividend increases on an annual basis in the beginning of the fourth quarter, consistent with the timing of our annual planning process. We appreciate the value of moving our dividend yield to be more in line with that of the S&P 500, and we'll factor that into our future deliberations. Finally, remaining cash will be invested in both debt reductions and share repurchases with more weighting towards debt reductions in 2013.
Now to Slide 18. We're reaffirming our 2012 guidance elements as discussed on last quarter's call. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we expect to come in at the low end of the range of $1.22 to $1.30 for adjusted EPS. Proportional free cash flow and subsidiary distributions are also expected to come in at the low end of our guidance range.
Now to Slide 19 and looking beyond 2012. We expect modest adjusted EPS growth in 2013 compared to our 2012 expectations. This modest growth is largely driven by improved operating performance at AES Gener in Chile, recovery at Eletropaulo in Brazil and the full year benefit of capital allocation and our cost savings initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by lower earnings in DPL and weaker foreign exchange. Please keep in mind that it's based on foreign exchange and commodities as of September 30, our expectations of near-term regulatory proceedings, particularly at DPL, and the current macro outlook in each of our key markets. To the extent these items change, our guidance could be impacted. 
This guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. If the CFC look-through is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this will be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss carryforward of about $2.1 billion. 
Overall, we continue to project a tax rate on adjusted earnings in the low 30% range.
As Andres discussed, we continue to look for opportunities to streamline our business focus. Although most of our efforts to date have been EPS neutral to accretive, this may be more difficult as we monetize some assets. Prior to releasing a defined 2013 guidance range during our year-end call, we'll have an updated view of relevant macro environments and the impact of potential portfolio de-risking activities.
Now to Slide 20. Earlier this year, we introduced a 3-year average annual total return target of 8% to 10% comprised of EPS growth and dividend yield. Since our last earnings call, we've made considerable progress on our annual planning process. And though not fully complete, it is evident to us that our earnings growth rate through 2015 will likely be lower than previous estimates. This decline was driven by lower earnings from DPL in 2014 and '15 due to the issues that Andres has covered. We had been anticipating some improvement at DPL, which is no longer the case. In addition, a compounding effect that reduced cash flow also has an impact. Secondly, lower-than-expected earnings in Brazil, driven largely by lower demand, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a more negative outcome than expected on the tariff reset in Eletropaulo. These will be partially offset by improved performance at our businesses in Chile, IPL in the U.S. and the additional cost savings we recently announced. In light of these factors, we're now expecting an average total return through 2015 of 6% to 8%. We appreciate that this is a difficult revision but believe it is a more appropriate reflection of our current outlook.
Before turning the call back to Andres, I'd like to cover the progress we're making on our almost 1,800 megawatts of projects under construction as well as our platform expansions under development. 
Looking at Slide 21, our construction program remains on schedule. In addition, we've already secured the necessary financing and funded 100% of our equity commitments for these projects. In terms of progress on these specific projects, work at our 270-megawatt, coal-fired Campiche project in Chile is progressing well. I was in Chile a couple of weeks ago and had a good first-hand look at the progress. Synchronization of the unit is scheduled for November, and commercial operation is expected in early 2013. In our Kribi project, a 216-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Cameroon, we've energized a 60-mile transmission line, and planned testing will begin in December. Finally, our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam is progressing on time and on budget, and operations are expected to begin in 2015. We're especially pleased that this project has surpassed 5 million man-hours without a lost time incident and is achieving world-class safety standards.
Now to Slide 22. In terms of future value creation beyond these construction projects, we continue to move forward on developing power plants in markets where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. Our focus is to use the most efficient source of capital, including bringing in strategic partners, using low-cost project financing, multilateral funding and operating cash flows generated at the existing businesses. For example, at Cochrane, 530-megawatt coal-fired expansion of our Angamos platform at AES Gener, we now have in place a construction contract, long-term power sales agreements for the majority output and are close to bringing in a strategic partner. We're focused on finalizing project financing, and construction is expected to begin in 2013. 
With regard to Alto Maipo, a 530-megawatt hydro project also at Gener, we've successfully executed the principal construction contracts, moved forward with preliminary works, continue to work on the remaining project milestones and expect to begin construction also in 2013. Similarly, here in the U.S., we plan to upgrade 100% of our baseload, coal-fired fleet at IPL with investments in environmental controls to comply with MATS. This investment will earn regulated returns and will also fulfill a majority of the necessary environmental upgrades required for MATS at all of our 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating here in the U.S. We expect this investment to begin in the second half 2013, carrying on through 2016, with potential equity investment of up to $300 million.
In closing, I look forward to seeing many of you next week in the EEI, and I'll now turn it back over to Andres."

We are pleased with our third quarter results, which were in line with expectations. We're on track to delivering 20% adjusted EPS growth this year, in line with our guidance. Despite the challenges we have faced recently, the earning power of the company remained strong, and we expect to deliver a 6% to 8% average annual return from 2012 through 2015, including dividend yield and EPS growth. Although we won't be satisfied with this rate of return, we believe it's prudent to lower expectations at this time primarily given lower forecasts from DPL and Brazil. But we will, nonetheless, continue to strive for higher total returns for our shareholders. We have taken actions to significantly reduce our overhead and streamline our organization. We will also aggressively pursue additional operating cost savings. We will continue to de-risk the company through deleveraging and narrowing our geographic focus through asset sales. And we're committed to pulling all levers to improve risk-adjusted returns from our platform businesses.

In terms of next year, I touched on it briefly, but the $550 million, back from the Slide 17, I think it was, will be lower next year really partially because of reduced cash coming from DPL. But also, we're making reinvestments in a couple of businesses. As I mentioned, IPL and, secondly, Gener. The number of the-- so we expect that to be lower. We'll give you a better idea of what our expectations will be at our year-end call when we give you guidance. I think, though, the $500 million-ish range is a more indicative indication of a more normalized number. So this year would be closer to what we think would be a more normalized number. Next year, it'll be lower, below the -- below, let's say, a $500 million normalized number really because of reinvestments we're making. In terms of the CapEx, I said up to $200 million. I do mean up to $200 million. One of the biggest things -- it could be as little as half that amount. One of the issues is that Gener, it's been a great performer for us, great grower. They are building the 2 projects: coal and the hydro. Coal come first, Cochrane I mentioned. But the issue was that they will need some equity at the Gener level to do that. And the $200 million would contemplate some equity being put in by AES. Obviously, another alternative is them issuing shares in the market to do that. So well-known company with good market cap, trades well, trades better than us. So as -- one of the things we'll think about is what the right funding is. To the extent that they access the majority of the equity they need in the markets, or maybe there's a splitting the baby concept, then that $200 million could be as low as $100 million to $125 million. That's just something we'll have to give some thought to. In terms of -- going back to the third part of your question, the 6 -- I think it's $6.2 billion of parent debt, including some trust preferreds, but we will look for coverage ratios. I think we've said that we want to maintain our rating and work it up over time. But the coverage ratio we'll look at in terms of debt-to-cash flow. I think we've used the range of 4.5 to 5.5. That continues to be a target that we've got. Near term, we're a little -- we're skewed towards the higher end of that range. That's why I said for '13, some of our cash flow available may be weighted more towards share repurchase. But once again, we see that as really a 2013-only focus. We've got the ability to do both, but we really focus -- kind of bottom line, We focus on the leverage, the coverage ratios. As you know, that's a more appropriate indication of credit quality."

Gener, will continue to do that. And I think the one change from the past is looking more at partners than we did, and that's partly due to project financing is getting tougher everywhere. So we'll continue to do at Gener what we've done and looking for the most tax-efficient way to do so and create the most value."

And we were actually somewhat less contracted than the -- our final objective in the north, and their prices were very low because of a -- basically, people had a take-or-pay gas contract. So those things get corrected. We also have, in terms of some of our wind projects in the U.S., as the tax equity, let's say, matures, that we will have more earnings from those assets in the U.S. And we'll also have the new plants that have been brought on for the full year.

I think that sort of going back to what we've laid out, we said we had a universe of about $2 billion of equity in assets that we could sell -- and so we've executed about half of that -- and that we would be concentrating on those that weren't sort of platforms for growth that had unused leverage capacity or the ability to raise our own money, or really places we didn't feel we had a sustainable competitive advantage. And so I think we've done that pretty much to date. Now going forward, what will we do? Well, look, the same framework is in place. We don't like to really give specific names because, of course, we're operating these businesses. And if we say they're up for sale, this -- it makes it more difficult to continue operating them at the optimal level. But again, there would be those where we have like one plant, one-off where we don't see a platform of growing. Regarding renewables, we have changed the way we think about those renewables, certainly wind. We're not thinking about a stand-alone wind business but really thinking of placing wind into the sort of geographic units that we have. So wind becomes just another way of providing energy. And what we've seen is where we really exploit the sort of platform concept, we're more successful. If you think of something like battery storage, we are leaders in exploiting, let's say, this technology. And where we've really been successful is where we apply it to our existing businesses. The one exception of this, of course, is solar. In solar, we have a 50-50 JV with Riverstone. And, of course, both of us will be seeking to monetize this asset over time. But other than that, I really can't give you more specifics. But I would say you should expect over time, a continued asset sales. This will also help us reduce cost, help us reduce our focus. And what we'll do is as soon as we really have something firm, announce it and make it public. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here."

So that's really what's causing this step-down of 2%. But I think that if you think of our portfolio, again if you take a longer period of view, we do have very competitive growth rates. I think that we provide the advantages of a diversified portfolio. Obviously, we're concentrated in fewer markets. You have less of this.

We don't have to be in 30 countries as where we started. So yes, do expect us to reduce, do expect us to become more efficient, as I think we're doing. I mean, we're -- we've reduced overhead. By next year, we'll be close to 25%. And the longer term, it's more like 1/3. And that's just overhead in terms of managing these businesses. So regarding your question, I do think that we will provide compelling returns. We are in the right markets, markets where there's growth. Chile's growing 5% to 6%. Columbia is growing 5% to 6%, Panama is growing 8%. Even Brazil longer term is expected to be growing at 4% after 1.6% this year.

We do have the tracker, and we believe the majority of those costs will be recovered, as Tom explained. It's pretty straightforward, and we've already submitted our certificate of public convenience and necessity and we're expecting that back relatively shortly. I think I mentioned on the last cost -- call what will make us think about whether we need to go into rates or not is how we deal with potential retirements of older coal units. We are looking at and still evaluating whether we may have to retire up to -- all the small coal units, which represent about 15% of our generation. If we do that, we probably will have to bring on new capacity and self-build it through the RFP process that we engaged in earlier. As we come to that decision, we would only be able to recover costs associated with that expansion in a rate case. And that's really what's out there. And as we get further along that process, we'll update you probably in the next call where we are, but that's really what Ton was alluding to, the potential that if we deem -- have to do the retirements and we do add in capacity, at that point we will need to consider going through rates so we -- to recover on that investment."

I always said that there was a universe of $2 billion and that we expect it -- to sell a high percentage of that but not 100% necessarily. So we never had a $2 billion target. Now in terms of the sales, I mean, I -- we did sell those. I think that we were in a good position to sell for very good multiples quickly, and I think our market timing was very good. Now looking forward, we're going to sell judiciously in the sense that we really want to maximize that the value of these. And I can give you just an illustration, is we could have sold and packaged all of our China assets, and we did have offers to sell it right away. But we took our time and sold to separate buyers, and we received a 40% premium versus the sort of altogether. And that's how we're going to continue with these asset sales. So I think that when we have several things under discussions that are -- and when we really do have something that we can bank on, then we will announce it. So we're working hard on this. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and say that we have something until we actually have it signed. So do I feel that if we reached, let's say, $1.7 billion or $1.5 billion, if we got the right price, then that's probably the right amount. I think what's important is that we got as much value out of it. And the second thing, which is also very important, is do we end up with the optimal company. Do we have the assets that we can administer efficiently that help add to the hole in terms of our synergies and our scale? So what's really important is not just the amount of money that's coming in, but do we end up with the right company at the end of the process."

Let me talk about our outlook on switching, and I want to sort of put this in the context of the ESP filing, which is essentially our view of Ohio. In the ESP filing, what we've done is we've locked in a view going forward of a switching rate of 62%. That is really what the switching was at the end of August. And we also had proposed somewhere through the AEP case a switching tracker so that fundamentally, we would be able to not have to forecast switching going forward, but that we would be held sort of neutral to switching rates forward to the outcomes of the rate case. That said, most of the battle right now is around residential customers. We have seen an increase in residential customers switching. It's about 2.5% a month. We see immediate probably around 75% switched. We're seeing most of the categories of customers, other than residential, reaching saturation levels. So that's really what we're seeing. It's mostly been increases or organic switching because I think a lot of the municipal aggregations have slowed down pending the outcome of all the cases and actually the elections that we've just had. So we anticipate that we're going to see continued, very intense competition in the residential class. We see that potentially saturating long term at about 80% -- 86% switched.

With that said, I think that answers part of the structural question. I going to ask Tom If he wants to answer the second part of your question."

We do have a refinancing of about $460 million at DP&L utility next year, and then the first major refinancing for the DPL -- I believe it's August of '14 -- of $400 million-plus.

We at AES have done as much as possible to help impacted areas, sending more than half of our available field resources from DP&L and IP&L (sic) [IPL] to help out affected service providers.
Now turning to the third quarter results. I'm pleased to say that our financial performance this quarter improved over both the second quarter of this year as well as the third quarter of 2011. This was expected and keeps us on track for our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.36 in the third quarter brings our year-to-date total to $0.91, which is $0.10 higher than what we earned in the first 9 months of 2011. The story is similar for our cash flow metrics. All in all, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance commitments for 2012.
Additionally, we recently announced organizational changes that will create greater efficiencies by placing functional and operational activities in the right place and eliminating overhead redundancies. These changes are in line with our strategy and build on the cost savings that we had implemented over the past year. I will discuss the financial benefits of this reorganization in some detail later on in my remarks.
Today, I'd like to focus on 2 main topics: first, an update on recent developments in our core markets, including DPL in the U.S., Brazil and Chile; and second, progress on our strategic plans to unlock shareholder value, including deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and improving profitability. Later, Tom will work you through the specific drivers of our results as well as our near-term outlook.
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to provide you with an update on recent developments at DPL. As we announced last week, we determined that a goodwill impairment of between $1.7 billion and $2 billion at DPL was required. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, the fundamentals of the business have been adversely affected since the acquisition was announced in April 2011. This is primarily the result of sustained lower natural gas prices and more customers moving to competitive retail providers, including our own, at reduced margins. Consequently, forecasted profitability and cash flows are lower, resulting in the goodwill impairment in the range we have provided. 
Obviously, we are disappointed with these developments at DPL. That said, we are committed to reaching the most positive regulatory and business outcome possible. To that end, we're working to achieve a reasonable result in the rate case, and we continue to expand our retail customer base inside and outside of DP&L's service territory. And we will strengthen DP&L's balance sheet by using its internally generated cash to pay down debt.
Our Electric Security Plan, or ESP, application is designed to balance DP&L's need to maintain its financial integrity with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's desire for a more rapid evolution to a market-based rate. If approved, the proposed ESP will allow DP&L to collect a non-bypassable Service Stability Rider that will give the company an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity. The approval process is moving forward, and the pre-hearings and technical conference have been scheduled for November 9. We are hopeful that the new ESP will be in place by no later than the first quarter of 2013. In the event that a decision or settlement is not reached by the end of 2012, we have also filed a motion with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio requesting an extension of DP&L's current rate until a final decision is reached.
Next, regarding our strategy to grow our retail customer base, we continue to expand our retail load inside and outside of DP&L's service territory in Ohio. Within DP&L's territory, we have retained roughly 75% of the switch load, although, as I said earlier, at significantly lower margins.
In markets outside of DP&L's service territory, both in Ohio and Illinois, our retail business is currently serving more than 150,000 customers. By year's end, we are projecting that DPL's retail business will be serving approximately 200,000 customers, which represent a net increase of approximately 175,000 in the company's total number of customers during 2012. 
Finally, we are working to strengthen DPL's balance sheet through a multiyear deleveraging and refinancing program. In 2012, we expect that DPL will distribute to AES $122 million, of which we've already received $87 million as of the end of September. Over the next couple of years, however, we expect to use essentially all cash generated from operations within the DPL group of companies for debt reduction.
Next, turning to Slide 5 and our businesses in Brazil. As many of you are aware, in order to stimulate the economy, the Government of Brazil recently announced an energy cost reduction program, or Provisional Measure 579, which targets a 20% reduction in electricity prices. About 1/3 of this planned reduction is expected to be driven by lowering indirect taxes on the sector. The remaining 2/3 of this reduction is being targeted through negotiations with various generators and T&D companies whose concession contracts are up for renewal between 2015 and 2017. These rules are still pending congressional approval and the implementation is scheduled for February of 2013. 
I would like to emphasize that the proposed rules are not expected to have any significant impact in the near term on our businesses in Brazil. Let me explain why. Tietê, our main generation business in Brazil, has a long-term concession expiring in 2029 and thus will not be subject to this regulation. Furthermore, we are insulated in the short term as 100% of Tietê's output is contracted with Eletropaulo through December 2015. Beyond 2015, it's still too early to tell what the incremental impact of MP 579 will be on energy prices in Brazil.
As far as the impact on our 2 distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul, we do not expect any meaningful impact on either. Both utilities earn a return on their regulated asset base, and energy purchases are treated as a cost pass-through. On balance, the Brazilian Government's initiatives to stimulate economic growth should help increase demand for electricity, which will result in increased revenue for both Eletropaulo and Sul.
Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to give you a brief update on AES Gener. I'm happy to report that all of our plants are fully available, including those that were offline in the second quarter for repairs and maintenance. As discussed on our previous calls, our Angamos plant in the north of Chile is now 90% contracted, and, therefore, it's exposure to low spot prices has been significantly reduced. In addition, we continue to see energy demand growth of between 4% and 6% in Chile. We've also seen positive results at some of our other important businesses, including Masinloc in the Philippines, Maritza in Bulgaria and Southland in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 7. I would like to provide you with an update on the strategic plan to unlock shareholder value that we laid out late last year. Just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for enhancing shareholder value are: first, optimizing capital allocation; second, improving the profitability of the existing portfolio; and third, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets.
Now turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. As we have discussed in the past, our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on a per share basis by allocating our discretionary cash across various uses, including deleveraging, share buyback, offering a predictable and growing dividend and investing in platform expansions. Last month, the Board approved the prepayment of $225 million of corporate debt, which we expect to complete later this year or early next. This will help us not only lower our interest expense but will also help us with our credit metrics by mitigating the impact of lost earnings and cash flows from assets that we have sold. Once completed, the prepayment will bring our total debt repayments to approximately $717 million since September of 2011, including both corporate-level debt and expensive nonrecourse debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary. 
With respect to share repurchases, in the third quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $49 million, representing an average price of $11.38. This brings our total investment in our shares since September of 2011 to $390 million, representing nearly 34 million shares or approximately 4% of shares outstanding.
Last but not least, we have also declared our first cash dividend in almost 20 years, which is set to be paid on November 15. The dividend is an important component of our total return proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 9, and let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. As you may recall, in late 2011, we announced an effort to reduce SG&A by $100 million by 2014. For 2012, we're ahead of our original goal of $50 million, and we now expect to achieve at least $65 million in cost savings this year. 
As a result of the recently announced reorganization, we now expect to realize the full $100 million of savings in 2013. Ultimately, the reorganization will result in additional savings of $45 million to achieve a total reduction of $145 million in annual overhead expense relative to 2011. 
I would like to point out that the cost saving numbers I just mentioned only reflect savings in overhead at the AES level, and they do not include additional cost savings at our businesses, such as Brazil, where we are implementing our Creando Valor [ph] program to improve that company's performance by $224 million per year by 2015, of which $150 million will be achieved by the end of 2012. We see additional opportunities for savings in fuel sourcing and in operations and maintenance expenses. For example, we presently purchase $2 billion of coal a year, and we're saving about $80 million as a result of implementing a comprehensive global sourcing framework, including the blending of coals and having the ability to redirect coal shipments. However, we believe we have not yet exploited all of the advantages from our global scale and possible synergies and are working hard to do so.
Moving to Slide 10. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales. Last quarter, we announced the sale of our China portfolio. I'm pleased to report that we have closed and received $86 million in the process for 2 of the 3 businesses. We expect the third transaction for $49 million to close within the next few weeks. To date, we have sold 9 assets for $933 million in net equity proceeds at an average PE multiple of more than 20. We continue to seek additional opportunities to streamline our portfolio by exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or a strong platform with an opportunity for expansion. Once completed, we expect that this strategy will result in a lower overall risk profile and a more focused and efficient company.
In summary, we believe that we are consistently executing on the plans that we laid out in our first call last November.
Now Tom will review the drivers of our quarterly results, guidance and platform expansion projects in more detail."

In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the businesses. Like any company, there are a number of exciting aspects and also some challenges. However, I've been impressed by the commitment of our people as well as the potential for improving our portfolio, delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and the other things that Andres laid out. 
This morning, beginning on Slide 11, I'll cover the following topics: first, our third quarter results and key drivers of gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax contribution and free cash flow and parent liquidity; second, our near-term capital allocation plans; and finally, an update on our guidance and total return expectations.
As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.36 of adjusted EPS for the third quarter. This brings our 9-month earnings to $0.91 or about 3/4 of the low end of our full year 2012 guidance.
Now to Slide 12. Our proportional gross margin increased by $168 million over the third quarter of 2011. The majority of this increase was driven by new businesses, such as Changuinola in Panama, Angamos in Chile and DPL in the U.S. In addition, we saw favorable year-over-year trends at several of our larger generation businesses, such as Masinloc in the Philippines and Maritza in Bulgaria. These trends were partially offset by lower tariff rates and higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo in Brazil.
Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 13. Third quarter results increased by $0.08, or 29%, to $0.36. This increase was primarily driven by $0.09 of contributions from the new businesses I just covered, $0.01 from lower share count and $0.02 from our cost-cutting initiatives, which have lowered SG&A expense by $26 million in the third quarter and $57 million year-to-date. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $0.03.
Now to Slide 14. I'd like to review a new earnings metric that we're introducing this quarter. We hear frequently from investors that with a large number of businesses, it can be difficult to determine what has the biggest impact on the bottom line. In an effort to provide additional transparency, we are introducing adjusted pretax contribution, a metric that we use internally to measure financial performance. This measure is calculated by taking the pretax earnings from each business, including those accounted for as equity in earnings, and adjusting for our ownership percentage. In addition, we make the same pro forma adjustments that we do for adjusted EPS. 
On Slide 14, we've graphed the relative contribution that each of our segments has made to year-to-date adjusted PTC of $1.5 billion. As you can see, for example, Latin America generation at 37% is the single largest contributor, driven primarily by our generation fleets at Chile, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. Our generation businesses in Europe and North America were also significant contributors. 
The measure also highlights that some of our businesses' consolidated results are significantly different than their bottom line impact. This is most notable in Eletropaulo, which we control and consolidate but have an economic interest of only about 16%. As shown on the slide, our utility businesses in Latin America contribute only 8% of adjusted PTC. We hope this additional disclosure will help to simplify the AES story and allow you to focus on the biggest value drivers.
Now to Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased $41 million compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses, partially offset by a decline in Eletropaulo.
Now on to Slide 16 and parent liquidity. During the quarter, we benefited from $426 million of inflows from asset sales and cash flow from our subsidiaries. Also during the quarter, we returned $71 million to shareholders via share repurchases. After $157 million of corporate interest, overhead and investments, we ended the third quarter with more than $1.2 billion of parent liquidity, up from $1 billion at the end of last quarter.
Now to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our plans for capital allocation for the balance of the year. This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 67% to returning cash to shareholders and deleveraging, including the $225 million debt paydown expected later this year or early next. We've allocated another 17%, or $262 million, to growth investments. The remaining 16%, or $258 million, of year-end cash will be combined with parent free cash flows in 2013 to be allocated in line with our capital allocation framework.
Now let me take a minute to review a couple of the segments for 2013. On the sources side, we expect parent free cash flow to be lower than the 2012 expectations of $550 million. It'll be due to 2 major factors, the first being DPL and secondly from AES Gener and IPL as those businesses retain some cash to reinvest. In terms of the use of discretionary cash, we expect growth investments to be lower than the 2012 levels of $262 million. These 2013 investments, which could total up to $200 million, are largely in platform expansions that I'll discuss in a moment. 
Regarding the dividend and growth, we expect to evaluate the reasonableness of dividend increases on an annual basis in the beginning of the fourth quarter, consistent with the timing of our annual planning process. We appreciate the value of moving our dividend yield to be more in line with that of the S&P 500, and we'll factor that into our future deliberations. Finally, the remaining cash will be invested in both debt reductions and share repurchases with more weighting towards debt reductions in 2013.
Now to Slide 18. We're reaffirming our 2012 guidance elements as discussed on last quarter's call. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we expect to come in at the low end of the range of $1.22 to $1.30 for adjusted EPS. Proportional free cash flow and subsidiary distributions are also expected to come in at the low end of our guidance range.
Now to Slide 19 and looking beyond 2012. We expect modest adjusted EPS growth in 2013 compared to our 2012 expectations. This modest growth is largely driven by improved operating performance at AES Gener in Chile, recovery at Eletropaulo in Brazil and the full year benefits of capital allocation and our cost savings initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by lower earnings from DPL and weaker foreign exchange. Please keep in mind that it's based on foreign exchange and commodities as of September 30, our expectations of near-term regulatory proceedings, particularly at DPL, and the current macro outlook in each of our key markets. To the extent these items change, our guidance could be impacted. 
This guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. If the CFC look-through rule is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss carryforward of about $2.1 billion. 
Overall, we continue to project a tax rate on adjusted earnings in the low 30% range.
As Andres discussed, we continue to look for opportunities to streamline our business focus. Although most of our efforts to date have been EPS neutral to accretive, this may be more difficult as we monetize some assets. Prior to releasing a defined 2013 guidance range during our year-end call, we'll have an updated view of relevant macro environments and the impact of potential portfolio de-risking activities.
Now to Slide 20. Earlier this year, we introduced a 3-year average annual total return target of 8% to 10% comprised of EPS growth and dividend yield. Since our last earnings call, we've made considerable progress on our annual planning process. And though not fully complete, it is evident to us that our earnings growth rate through 2015 will likely be lower than previous estimates. This decline is driven by lower earnings from DPL in 2014 and '15 due to the issues that Andres has covered. We had been anticipating some improvement at DPL, which is no longer the case. In addition, the compounding effect that reduced cash flow also has an impact. Secondly, lower-than-expected earnings in Brazil, driven largely by lower demand, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a more negative outcome than expected on the tariff reset at Eletropaulo. These will be partially offset by improved performance at our businesses in Chile, IPL in the U.S. and the additional cost savings we recently announced. In light of these factors, we're now expecting an average total return through 2015 of 6% to 8%. We appreciate that this is a difficult revision but believe it is a more appropriate reflection of our current outlook.
Before turning the call back to Andres, I'd like to cover the progress we're making on our almost 1,800 megawatts of projects under construction as well as our platform expansions under development. 
Looking at Slide 21, our construction program remains on schedule. In addition, we've already secured the necessary financing and funded 100% of our equity commitments for these projects. In terms of progress on these specific projects, work at our 270-megawatt, coal-fired Campiche project in Chile is progressing well. I was in Chile a couple of weeks ago and had a good first-hand look at the progress. Synchronization of the unit is scheduled for November, and commercial operation is expected in early 2013. At our Kribi project, a 216-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Cameroon, we've energized a 60-mile transmission line, and plant testing will begin in December. Finally, our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam is progressing on time and on budget, and operations are expected to begin in 2015. We're especially pleased that this project has surpassed 5 million man-hours without a lost time incident and is achieving world-class safety standards.
Now to Slide 22. In terms of future value creation beyond these construction projects, we continue to move forward on developing power plants in the markets where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. Our focus is to use the most efficient source of capital, including bringing in strategic partners, using low-cost project financing, multilateral funding and operating cash flows generated at the existing businesses. For example, at Cochrane, 530-megawatt coal-fired expansion of our Angamos platform at AES Gener, we now have in place a construction contract, long-term power sales agreements for the majority of output and are close to bringing in a strategic partner. We're focused on finalizing project financing, and construction is expected to begin in 2013. 
With regard to Alto Maipo, a 530-megawatt hydro project also at Gener, we've successfully executed the principal construction contracts, moved forward with preliminary works, continue to work on the remaining project milestones and expect to begin construction also in 2013. Similarly, here in the U.S., we plan to upgrade 100% of our baseload, coal-fired fleet at IPL with investments in environmental controls to comply with MATS. This investment will earn regulated returns and will also fulfill a majority of the necessary environmental upgrades required for MATS at all of our 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating here in the U.S. We expect this investment to begin in the second half 2013, carrying on through 2016, with potential equity investment of up to $300 million.
In closing, I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI, and I'll now turn it back over to Andres."

Although we won't be satisfied with this rate of return, we believe it's prudent to lower expectations at this time primarily given lower forecasts from DPL and Brazil. But we will, nonetheless, continue to strive for higher total returns for our shareholders. We have taken actions to significantly reduce our overhead and streamline our organization. We will also aggressively pursue additional operating cost savings. We will continue to de-risk the company through deleveraging and narrowing our geographic focus through asset sales.

In terms of next year, I touched on it briefly, but the $550 million, back from the Slide 17, I think it was, will be lower next year really partially because of reduced cash coming from DPL. But also, we're making reinvestments in a couple of businesses. As I mentioned, IPL and, secondly, Gener. The number of the-- so we expect that to be lower. We'll give you a better idea of what our expectations will be at our year-end call when we give you guidance. I think, though, the $500 million-ish range is a more indicative indication of a more normalized number. So this year would be closer to what we think would be a more normalized number. Next year, it'll be lower, below the -- below the, let's say, a $500 million normalized number really because of the reinvestments we're making. In terms of the CapEx, I said up to $200 million. I do mean up to $200 million. One of the biggest things -- it could be as little as half that amount. One of the issues is that Gener, it's been a great performer for us, great grower. They are building the 2 projects: coal and the hydro. Coal will come first, Cochrane I mentioned. But the issue was that they will need some equity at the Gener level to do that. And the $200 million would contemplate some equity being put in by AES. Obviously, another alternative is them issuing shares in the market to do that. So well-known company with good market cap, trades well, trades better than us. So as -- one of the things we'll think about is what the right funding is. To the extent that they access the majority of the equity they need in the markets, or maybe there's a splitting the baby concept, then that $200 million could be as little as $100 million to $125 million. That's just something we'll have to give some thought to. In terms of -- going back to the third part of your question, the 6 -- I think it's $6.2 billion of parent debt, including some trust preferreds, but we will look for coverage ratios. I think we've said that we want to maintain our rating and work it up over time. But the coverage ratio we look at in terms of debt-to-cash flow. I think we've used the range of 4.5 to 5.5. That continues to be a target that we've got. Near term, we're a little -- we're skewed towards the higher end of that range. That's why I said for '13, some of our cash flow available may be weighted more towards share repurchase. But once again, we see that as really a 2013-only focus. We've got the ability to do both, but we really focus -- kind of bottom line, We focus on the leverage, the coverage ratios. As you know, that's a more appropriate indication of credit quality."

So we'll continue to do at Gener what we've done and looking for the most tax-efficient way to do so and create the most value."

And we were actually somewhat less contracted than the -- our final objective in the north, and their prices were very low because of a -- basically, people had a take-or-pay gas contract. So those things get corrected. We also have, in terms of some of our wind projects in the U.S., as the tax equity, let's say, matures, that we will have more earnings from those assets in the U.S. And we'll also have the new plants that have been brought on for the full year. And so I think that, that -- those are some of the main drivers that we have. We can give you perhaps a more -- a specific breakdown of the small plants.

I think that sort of going back to what we've laid out, we said we had a universe of about $2 billion of equity in assets that we could sell -- and so we've executed about half of that -- and that we would be concentrating on those that weren't sort of platforms for growth that had unused leverage capacity or the ability to raise our own money, or really places we didn't feel we had a sustainable competitive advantage. And so I think we've done that pretty much to date. Now going forward, what will we do? Well, look, the same framework is in place. We don't like to really give specific names because, of course, we're operating these businesses. And if we say they're up for sale, this -- it makes it more difficult to continue operating them at the optimal level. But again, there would be those where we have like one plant, one-off where we don't see a platform of growing. Regarding renewables, we have changed the way we think about most renewables, certainly wind. We're not thinking about a stand-alone wind business but really thinking of placing wind into the sort of geographic units that we have. So wind becomes just another way of providing energy. And what we've seen is where we really exploit the sort of platform concept, we're more successful. If you think of something like battery storage, we are leaders in exploiting, let's say, this technology. And where we've really been successful is where we apply it to our existing businesses. The one exception of this, of course, is solar. In solar, we have a 50-50 JV with Riverstone. And, of course, both of us will be seeking to monetize this asset over time. But other than that, I really can't give you more specifics. But I would say you should expect over time, a continued asset sales. This will also help us reduce cost, help us reduce our focus. And what we'll do is as soon as we really have something firm, announce it and make it public. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here."

So I think that would probably certainly rank us among the top of our peers in this space. So I think what we're doing is coming off a growth of 20%. Now what we have done is really look at adapting to what we see as the new forecast for DP&L, some of the FX and some of the tariffs in Brazil and just saying we want to be prudent, we want to overachieve whatever we give out there as guidance. So that's really what's causing this step-down of 2%. But I think that if you think of our portfolio, again if you take a longer period of view, we do have very competitive growth rates. I think that we provide the advantages of a diversified portfolio. Obviously, we're concentrated in fewer markets. You have less of this. But I do think -- and we have said from day 1 that we do think that we're in too many markets. And so we do want to focus, and then we can have all the advantages of a portfolio diversification. We don't have to be in 30 countries as where we started. So yes, do expect us to reduce, do expect us to become more efficient, as I think we're doing. I mean, we're -- we've reduced overhead. By next year, we'll be close to 25%. And the longer term, it's more like 1/3. And that's just overhead in terms of managing these businesses. So regarding your question, I do think that we will provide compelling returns. We are in the right markets, markets where there's growth. Chile's growing 5% to 6%. Columbia is growing 5% to 6%, Panama is growing 8%. Even Brazil longer term is expected to be growing at 4% after 1.6% this year. So I think it's hard for you to find another portfolio that has these growth rates, and I think we have a clear strategy for executing on them.

We have a very constructive regulatory environment with the environmental trackers. We've managed our costs very well. We have the -- among the highest level of reliability in the state, and we have among the lowest cost of service in Indiana. I think that when we talk about the current investment that we have, which is to meet the federal regulations on hazardous emissions, that's not driving us anywhere near rates. We do have the tracker, and we believe the majority of those costs will be recovered, as Tom explained. It's pretty straightforward, and we've already submitted our certificate of public convenience and necessity and we're expecting that back relatively shortly. I think I mentioned on the last cost -- call what will make us think about whether we need to go into rates or not is how we deal with potential retirements of older coal units. We are looking at and still evaluating whether we may have to retire up to -- older small coal units, which represent about 15% of our generation. If we do that, we probably will have to bring on new capacity, either self-build or through the RFP process that we engaged in earlier. Once we come to that decision, we would only be able to recover costs associated with that expansion in a rate case. And that's really what's out there. And as we get further along that process, we'll update you probably in the next call where we are, but that's really what Ton was alluding to, the potential that if we deem -- have to do the retirements and we do add in capacity, at that point we will need to consider going through rates so we -- to recover on that investment."

No, no, I would like to just make one clarification. I never said there was a $2 billion target. I always said that there was a universe of $2 billion and that we expect it -- to sell a high percentage of that but not 100% necessarily. So we never had a $2 billion target. Now in terms of the sales, I mean, I -- we did sell those. I think that we were in a good position to sell for very good multiples quickly, and I think our market timing was very good. Now looking forward, we're going to sell judiciously in the sense that we really want to maximize that -- the value of these. And I can give you just an illustration, is we could have sold and packaged all of our China assets, and we did have offers to sell it right away. But we took our time and sold to separate buyers, and we received a 40% premium versus the sort of altogether. And that's how we're going to continue with these asset sales. So I think that when we have several things under discussions that are -- and when we really do have something that we can bank on, then we will announce it. So we're working hard on this. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and say that we have something until we actually have it signed. So do I feel that if we reached, let's say, $1.7 billion or $1.5 billion, if we got the right prices, then that's probably the right amount. I think what's important is that we got as much value out of it. And the second thing, which is also very important, is do we end up with the optimal company. Do we have the assets that we can administer efficiently that help add to the whole in terms of our synergies and our scale? So what's really important is not just the amount of money that's coming in, but do we end up with the right company at the end of the process."

Let me talk about our outlook on switching, and I want to sort of put this in the context of the ESP filing, which is essentially our view of Ohio. In the ESP filing, what we've done is we've locked in a view going forward of a switching rate of 62%. That is really what the switching was at the end of August. And we also had proposed somewhere through the AEP case a switching tracker so that fundamentally, we would be able to not have to forecast switching going forward, but that we would be held sort of neutral to switching rates going forward to the outcomes of the rate case. That said, most of the battle right now is around residential customers. We have seen an increase in residential customers switching. It's about 2.5% a month. We see, ending the year, probably around 75% switched. We're seeing most of the categories of customers, other than residential, reaching saturation levels. So that's really what we're seeing. It's mostly been increases in organic switching because I think a lot of the municipal aggregations have slowed down pending the outcome of all the cases and actually the elections that we've just had. So we anticipate that we're going to see continued very intense competition in the residential class. We see that potentially saturating long term at about 80% -- 86% switched. So where competition is intense, so as Andre said, we are replacing more customers than we've lost,  more load than we've lost. But clearly, it's an extremely competitive environment."

And emerging during those initial settlement discussions have been this question of legal separation of the generation assets even though we believe that the functional separation that we have today actually is fighting competition. What we've done in the filing is we addressed all these issues. We have made -- we are not asking for any approvals to separate generation in the current ESP filing. And as you know, we filed ESP on October 5. What we have done is we made a commitment in the current filing that we will come back by the end of the year with another filing specifically talking about the transition of generation and looking towards legal separation by the end of 2017.

We at AES have done as much as possible to help impacted areas, sending more than half of our available field resources from DP&L and IP&L (sic) [IPL] to help out affected service providers.
Now turning to the third quarter results. I'm pleased to say that our financial performance this quarter improved over both the second quarter of this year as well as the third quarter of 2011. This was expected and keeps us on track for our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.36 in the third quarter brings our year-to-date total to $0.91, which is $0.10 higher than what we earned in the first 9 months of 2011. The story is similar for our cash flow metrics. All in all, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance commitments for 2012.
Additionally, we recently announced organizational changes that will create greater efficiencies by placing functional and operational activities in the right place and eliminating overhead redundancies. These changes are in line with our strategy and build on the cost savings that we had implemented over the past year. I will discuss the financial benefits of this reorganization in some detail later on in my remarks.
Today, I'd like to focus on 2 main topics: first, an update on recent developments in our core markets, including DPL in the U.S., Brazil and Chile; and second, progress on our strategic plans to unlock shareholder value, including deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and improving profitability. Later, Tom will work you through the specific drivers of our results as well as our near-term outlook.
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to provide you with an update on recent developments at DPL. As we announced last week, we determined that a goodwill impairment of between $1.7 billion and $2 billion at DPL was required. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, the fundamentals of the business have been adversely affected since the acquisition was announced in April 2011. This is primarily the result of sustained lower natural gas prices and more customers moving to competitive retail providers, including our own, at reduced margins. Consequently, forecasted profitability and cash flows are lower, resulting in the goodwill impairment in the range we have provided. 
Obviously, we are disappointed with these developments at DPL. That said, we are committed to reaching the most positive regulatory and business outcome possible. To that end, we're working to achieve a reasonable result in the rate case, and we continue to expand our retail customer base inside and outside of DP&L's service territory. And we will strengthen DP&L's balance sheet by using its internally generated cash to pay down debt.
Our Electric Security Plan, or ESP, application is designed to balance DP&L's need to maintain its financial integrity with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's desire for a more rapid evolution to a market-based rate. If approved, the proposed ESP will allow DP&L to collect a non-bypassable Service Stability Rider that will give the company an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity. The approval process is moving forward, and the pre-hearings and technical conference have been scheduled for November 9. We are hopeful that the new ESP will be in place by no later than the first quarter of 2013. In the event that a decision or settlement is not reached by the end of 2012, we have also filed a motion with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio requesting an extension of DP&L's current rate until a final decision is reached.
Next, regarding our strategy to grow our retail customer base, we continue to expand our retail load inside and outside of DP&L's service territory in Ohio. Within DP&L's territory, we have retained roughly 75% of the switch load, although, as I said earlier, at significantly lower margins.
In markets outside of DP&L's service territory, both in Ohio and Illinois, our retail business is currently serving more than 150,000 customers. By year's end, we are projecting that DPL's retail business will be serving approximately 200,000 customers, which represent a net increase of approximately 175,000 in the company's total number of customers during 2012. 
Finally, we are working to strengthen DPL's balance sheet through a multiyear deleveraging and refinancing program. In 2012, we expect that DPL will distribute to AES $122 million, of which we've already received $87 million as of the end of September. Over the next couple of years, however, we expect to use essentially all cash generated from operations within the DPL group of companies for debt reduction.
Next, turning to Slide 5 and our businesses in Brazil. As many of you are aware, in order to stimulate the economy, the Government of Brazil recently announced an energy cost reduction program, or Provisional Measure 579, which targets a 20% reduction in electricity prices. About 1/3 of this planned reduction is expected to be driven by lowering indirect taxes on the sector. The remaining 2/3 of this reduction is being targeted through negotiations with various generators and T&D companies whose concession contracts are up for renewal between 2015 and 2017. These rules are still pending congressional approval and the implementation is scheduled for February of 2013. 
I would like to emphasize that the proposed rules are not expected to have any significant impact in the near term on our businesses in Brazil. Let me explain why. Tietê, our main generation business in Brazil, has a long-term concession expiring in 2029 and thus will not be subject to this regulation. Furthermore, we are insulated in the short term as 100% of Tietê's output is contracted with Eletropaulo through December 2015. Beyond 2015, it's still too early to tell what the incremental impact of MP 579 will be on energy prices in Brazil.
As far as the impact on our 2 distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul, we do not expect any meaningful impact on either. Both utilities earn a return on their regulated asset base, and energy purchases are treated as a cost pass-through. On balance, the Brazilian Government's initiatives to stimulate economic growth should help increase demand for electricity, which will result in increased revenue for both Eletropaulo and Sul.
Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to give you a brief update on AES Gener. I'm happy to report that all of our plants are fully available, including those that were offline in the second quarter for repairs and maintenance. As discussed on our previous calls, our Angamos plant in the north of Chile is now 90% contracted, and, therefore, it's exposure to low spot prices has been significantly reduced. In addition, we continue to see energy demand growth of between 4% and 6% in Chile. We've also seen positive results at some of our other important businesses, including Masinloc in the Philippines, Maritza in Bulgaria and Southland in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 7. I would like to provide you with an update on the strategic plan to unlock shareholder value that we laid out late last year. Just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for enhancing shareholder value are: first, optimizing capital allocation; second, improving the profitability of the existing portfolio; and third, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets.
Now turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. As we have discussed in the past, our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on a per share basis by allocating our discretionary cash across various uses, including deleveraging, share buyback, offering a predictable and growing dividend and investing in platform expansions. Last month, the Board approved the prepayment of $225 million of corporate debt, which we expect to complete later this year or early next. This will help us not only lower our interest expense but will also help us with our credit metrics by mitigating the impact of lost earnings and cash flows from assets that we have sold. Once completed, the prepayment will bring our total debt repayments to approximately $717 million since September of 2011, including both corporate-level debt and expensive nonrecourse debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary. 
With respect to share repurchases, in the third quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $49 million, representing an average price of $11.38. This brings our total investment in our shares since September of 2011 to $390 million, representing nearly 34 million shares or approximately 4% of shares outstanding.
Last but not least, we have also declared our first cash dividend in almost 20 years, which is set to be paid on November 15. The dividend is an important component of our total return proposition.
Now please turn to Slide 9, and let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. As you may recall, in late 2011, we announced an effort to reduce SG&A by $100 million by 2014. For 2012, we're ahead of our original goal of $50 million, and we now expect to achieve at least $65 million in cost savings this year. 
As a result of the recently announced reorganization, we now expect to realize the full $100 million of savings in 2013. Ultimately, the reorganization will result in additional savings of $45 million to achieve a total reduction of $145 million in annual overhead expense relative to 2011. 
I would like to point out that the cost saving numbers I just mentioned only reflect savings in overhead at the AES level, and they do not include additional cost savings at our businesses, such as Brazil, where we are implementing our Creando Valor [ph] program to improve that company's performance by $224 million per year by 2015, of which $150 million will be achieved by the end of 2012. We see additional opportunities for savings in fuel sourcing and in operations and maintenance expenses. For example, we presently purchase $2 billion of coal a year, and we're saving about $80 million as a result of implementing a comprehensive global sourcing framework, including the blending of coals and having the ability to redirect coal shipments. However, we believe we have not yet exploited all of the advantages from our global scale and possible synergies and are working hard to do so.
Moving to Slide 10. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales. Last quarter, we announced the sale of our China portfolio. I'm pleased to report that we have closed and received $86 million in the process for 2 of the 3 businesses. We expect the third transaction for $49 million to close within the next few weeks. To date, we have sold 9 assets for $933 million in net equity proceeds at an average PE multiple of more than 20. We continue to seek additional opportunities to streamline our portfolio by exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or a strong platform with an opportunity for expansion. Once completed, we expect that this strategy will result in a lower overall risk profile and a more focused and efficient company.
In summary, we believe that we are consistently executing on the plans that we laid out in our first call last November.
Now Tom will review the drivers of our quarterly results, guidance and platform expansion projects in more detail."

Before I get into our results, I'd first like to say that I'm very pleased to be here. In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the businesses. Like any company,",1969,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning all. Before I get into our results, I'd first like to say that I'm very pleased to be here. In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the businesses. Like any company, there are a number of exciting aspects and also some challenges. However, I've been impressed by the commitment of our people as well as the potential for improving our portfolio, delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and the other things that Andres laid out. 
This morning, beginning on Slide 11, I'll cover the following topics: first, our third quarter results and key drivers of gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax contribution and free cash flow and parent liquidity; second, our near-term capital allocation plans; and finally, an update on our guidance and total return expectations.
As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.36 of adjusted EPS for the third quarter. This brings our 9-month earnings to $0.91 or about 3/4 of the low end of our full year 2012 guidance.
Now to Slide 12. Our proportional gross margin increased by $168 million over the third quarter of 2011. The majority of this increase was driven by new businesses, such as Changuinola in Panama, Angamos in Chile and DPL in the U.S. In addition, we saw favorable year-over-year trends at several of our larger generation businesses, such as Masinloc in the Philippines and Maritza in Bulgaria. These trends were partially offset by lower tariff rates and higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo in Brazil.
Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 13. Third quarter results increased by $0.08, or 29%, to $0.36. This increase was primarily driven by $0.09 of contributions from the new businesses I just covered, $0.01 from lower share count and $0.02 from our cost-cutting initiatives, which have lowered SG&A expense by $26 million in the third quarter and $57 million year-to-date. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $0.03.
Now to Slide 14. I'd like to review a new earnings metric that we're introducing this quarter. We hear frequently from investors that with a large number of businesses, it can be difficult to determine what has the biggest impact on the bottom line. In an effort to provide additional transparency, we are introducing adjusted pretax contribution, a metric that we use internally to measure financial performance. This measure is calculated by taking the pretax earnings from each business, including those accounted for as equity in earnings, and adjusting for our ownership percentage. In addition, we make the same pro forma adjustments that we do for adjusted EPS. 
On Slide 14, we've graphed the relative contribution that each of our segments has made to year-to-date adjusted PTC of $1.5 billion. As you can see, for example, Latin America generation at 37% is the single largest contributor, driven primarily by our generation fleets at Chile, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. Our generation businesses in Europe and North America were also significant contributors. 
The measure also highlights that some of our businesses' consolidated results are significantly different than their bottom line impact. This is most notable in Eletropaulo, which we control and consolidate but have an economic interest of only about 16%. As shown on the slide, our utility businesses in Latin America contribute only 8% of adjusted PTC. We hope this additional disclosure will help to simplify the AES story and allow you to focus on the biggest value drivers.
Now to Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased $41 million compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses, partially offset by a decline in Eletropaulo.
Now on to Slide 16 and parent liquidity. During the quarter, we benefited from $426 million of inflows from asset sales and cash flow from our subsidiaries. Also during the quarter, we returned $71 million to shareholders via share repurchases. After $157 million of corporate interest, overhead and investments, we ended the third quarter with more than $1.2 billion of parent liquidity, up from $1 billion at the end of last quarter.
Now to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our plans for capital allocation for the balance of the year. This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 67% to returning cash to shareholders and deleveraging, including the $225 million debt paydown expected later this year or early next. We've allocated another 17%, or $262 million, to growth investments. The remaining 16%, or $258 million, of year-end cash will be combined with parent free cash flows in 2013 to be allocated in line with our capital allocation framework.
Now let me take a minute to review a couple of the segments for 2013. On the sources side, we expect parent free cash flow to be lower than the 2012 expectations of $550 million. It'll be due to 2 major factors, the first being DPL and secondly from AES Gener and IPL as those businesses retain some cash to reinvest. In terms of the use of discretionary cash, we expect growth investments to be lower than the 2012 levels of $262 million. These 2013 investments, which could total up to $200 million, are largely in platform expansions that I'll discuss in a moment. 
Regarding the dividend and growth, we expect to evaluate the reasonableness of dividend increases on an annual basis in the beginning of the fourth quarter, consistent with the timing of our annual planning process. We appreciate the value of moving our dividend yield to be more in line with that of the S&P 500, and we'll factor that into our future deliberations. Finally, the remaining cash will be invested in both debt reductions and share repurchases with more weighting towards debt reductions in 2013.
Now to Slide 18. We're reaffirming our 2012 guidance elements as discussed on last quarter's call. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we expect to come in at the low end of the range of $1.22 to $1.30 for adjusted EPS. Proportional free cash flow and subsidiary distributions are also expected to come in at the low end of our guidance range.
Now to Slide 19 and looking beyond 2012. We expect modest adjusted EPS growth in 2013 compared to our 2012 expectations. This modest growth is largely driven by improved operating performance at AES Gener in Chile, recovery at Eletropaulo in Brazil and the full year benefits of capital allocation and our cost savings initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by lower earnings from DPL and weaker foreign exchange. Please keep in mind that it's based on foreign exchange and commodities as of September 30, our expectations of near-term regulatory proceedings, particularly at DPL, and the current macro outlook in each of our key markets. To the extent these items change, our guidance could be impacted. 
This guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. If the CFC look-through rule is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss carryforward of about $2.1 billion. 
Overall, we continue to project a tax rate on adjusted earnings in the low 30% range.
As Andres discussed, we continue to look for opportunities to streamline our business focus. Although most of our efforts to date have been EPS neutral to accretive, this may be more difficult as we monetize some assets. Prior to releasing a defined 2013 guidance range during our year-end call, we'll have an updated view of relevant macro environments and the impact of potential portfolio de-risking activities.
Now to Slide 20. Earlier this year, we introduced a 3-year average annual total return target of 8% to 10% comprised of EPS growth and dividend yield. Since our last earnings call, we've made considerable progress on our annual planning process. And though not fully complete, it is evident to us that our earnings growth rate through 2015 will likely be lower than previous estimates. This decline is driven by lower earnings from DPL in 2014 and '15 due to the issues that Andres has covered. We had been anticipating some improvement at DPL, which is no longer the case. In addition, the compounding effect that reduced cash flow also has an impact. Secondly, lower-than-expected earnings in Brazil, driven largely by lower demand, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a more negative outcome than expected on the tariff reset at Eletropaulo. These will be partially offset by improved performance at our businesses in Chile, IPL in the U.S. and the additional cost savings we recently announced. In light of these factors, we're now expecting an average total return through 2015 of 6% to 8%. We appreciate that this is a difficult revision but believe it is a more appropriate reflection of our current outlook.
Before turning the call back to Andres, I'd like to cover the progress we're making on our almost 1,800 megawatts of projects under construction as well as our platform expansions under development. 
Looking at Slide 21, our construction program remains on schedule. In addition, we've already secured the necessary financing and funded 100% of our equity commitments for these projects. In terms of progress on these specific projects, work at our 270-megawatt, coal-fired Campiche project in Chile is progressing well. I was in Chile a couple of weeks ago and had a good first-hand look at the progress. Synchronization of the unit is scheduled for November, and commercial operation is expected in early 2013. At our Kribi project, a 216-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Cameroon, we've energized a 60-mile transmission line, and plant testing will begin in December. Finally, our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam is progressing on time and on budget, and operations are expected to begin in 2015. We're especially pleased that this project has surpassed 5 million man-hours without a lost time incident and is achieving world-class safety standards.
Now to Slide 22. In terms of future value creation beyond these construction projects, we continue to move forward on developing power plants in the markets where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. Our focus is to use the most efficient source of capital, including bringing in strategic partners, using low-cost project financing, multilateral funding and operating cash flows generated at the existing businesses. For example, at Cochrane, 530-megawatt coal-fired expansion of our Angamos platform at AES Gener, we now have in place a construction contract, long-term power sales agreements for the majority of output and are close to bringing in a strategic partner. We're focused on finalizing project financing, and construction is expected to begin in 2013. 
With regard to Alto Maipo, a 530-megawatt hydro project also at Gener, we've successfully executed the principal construction contracts, moved forward with preliminary works, continue to work on the remaining project milestones and expect to begin construction also in 2013. Similarly, here in the U.S., we plan to upgrade 100% of our baseload, coal-fired fleet at IPL with investments in environmental controls to comply with MATS. This investment will earn regulated returns and will also fulfill a majority of the necessary environmental upgrades required for MATS at all of our 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating here in the U.S. We expect this investment to begin in the second half 2013, carrying on through 2016, with potential equity investment of up to $300 million.
In closing, I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI, and I'll now turn it back over to Andres."

We are pleased with our third quarter results, which were in line with expectations. We're on track to deliver a 20% adjusted EPS growth this year, in line with our guidance. Despite the challenges we have faced recently, the earning power of the company remained strong, and we expect to deliver a 6% to 8% average annual return from 2012 through 2015, including dividend yield and EPS growth. Although we won't be satisfied with this rate of return, we believe it's prudent to lower expectations at this time primarily given lower forecasts from DPL and Brazil. But we will, nonetheless, continue to strive for higher total returns for our shareholders. We have taken actions to significantly reduce our overhead and streamline our organization. We will also aggressively pursue additional operating cost savings. We will continue to de-risk the company through deleveraging and narrowing our geographic focus through asset sales. And we're committed to pulling all levers to improve risk-adjusted returns from our platform businesses.

First of all, is there a good way of thinking about what the long-term parent free cash flow contribution from the subsidiaries is? Is that something less than $500 million? I mean, how do we think about what that's going to be longer term? And secondly, of your $6 billion of recourse debt, do you have a target in mind of what you want to get  that down to?

But also, we're making reinvestments",496,"Okay, Jon, good questions. In terms of next year, I touched on it briefly, but the $550 million, back from the Slide 17, I think it was, will be lower next year really partially because of reduced cash coming from DPL. But also, we're making reinvestments in a couple of businesses. As I mentioned, IPL and, secondly, Gener. The number of the-- so we expect that to be lower. We'll give you a better idea of what our expectations will be at our year-end call when we give you guidance. I think, though, the $500 million-ish range is a more indicative indication of a more normalized number. So this year would be closer to what we think would be a more normalized number. Next year, it'll be lower, below the -- below the, let's say, a $500 million normalized number really because of the reinvestments we're making. In terms of the CapEx, I said up to $200 million. I do mean up to $200 million. One of the biggest things -- it could be as little as half that amount. One of the issues is that Gener, it's been a great performer for us, great grower. They are building the 2 projects: coal and the hydro. Coal will come first, Cochrane I mentioned. But the issue was that they will need some equity at the Gener level to do that. And the $200 million would contemplate some equity being put in by AES. Obviously, another alternative is them issuing shares in the market to do that. So well-known company with good market cap, trades well, trades better than us. So as -- one of the things we'll think about is what the right funding is. To the extent that they access the majority of the equity they need in the markets, or maybe there's a splitting the baby concept, then that $200 million could be as little as $100 million to $125 million. That's just something we'll have to give some thought to. In terms of -- going back to the third part of your question, the 6 -- I think it's $6.2 billion of parent debt, including some trust preferreds, but we will look for coverage ratios. I think we've said that we want to maintain our rating and work it up over time. But the coverage ratio we look at in terms of debt-to-cash flow. I think we've used the range of 4.5 to 5.5. That continues to be a target that we've got. Near term, we're a little -- we're skewed towards the higher end of that range. That's why I said for '13, some of our cash flow available may be weighted more towards share repurchase. But once again, we see that as really a 2013-only focus. We've got the ability to do both, but we really focus -- kind of bottom line, we focus on the leverage, the coverage ratios. As you know, that's a more appropriate indication of credit quality."

And as Tom mentioned in his speech, we're also looking at partners, partners that bring not only financing, but they bring access to bilaterals, Exims, et cetera. So really, we're optimizing. Gener, will continue to do that. And I think the one change from the past is looking more at partners than we did, and that's partly due to project financing is getting tougher everywhere. So we'll continue to do at Gener what we've done and looking for the most tax-efficient way to do so and create the most value."

I think that sort of going back to what we've laid out, we said we had a universe of about $2 billion of equity in assets that we could sell -- and so we've executed about half of that -- and that we would be concentrating on those that weren't sort of platforms for growth that had unused leverage capacity or the ability to raise our own money, or really places we didn't feel we had a sustainable competitive advantage. And so I think we've done that pretty much to date. Now going forward, what will we do? Well, look, the same framework is in place. We don't like to really give specific names because, of course, we're operating these businesses. And if we say they're up for sale, this -- it makes it more difficult to continue operating them at the optimal level. But again, there would be those where we have like one plant, one-off where we don't see a platform of growing. Regarding renewables, we have changed the way we think about most renewables, certainly wind. We're not thinking about a stand-alone wind business but really thinking of placing wind into the sort of geographic units that we have. So wind becomes just another way of providing energy. And what we've seen is where we really exploit the sort of platform concept, we're more successful. If you think of something like battery storage, we are leaders in exploiting, let's say, this technology. And where we've really been successful is where we apply it to our existing businesses. The one exception of this, of course, is solar. In solar, we have a 50-50 JV with Riverstone. And, of course, both of us will be seeking to monetize this asset over time. But other than that, I really can't give you more specifics. But I would say you should expect over time, a continued asset sales. This will also help us reduce cost, help us reduce our focus. And what we'll do is as soon as we really have something firm, announce it and make it public. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here."

Now what we have done is really look at adapting to what we see as the new forecast for DP&L, some of the FX and some of the tariffs in Brazil and just saying we want to be prudent, we want to overachieve whatever we give out there as guidance. So that's really what's causing this step-down of 2%. But I think that if you think of our portfolio, again if you take a longer period of view, we do have very competitive growth rates. I think that we provide the advantages of a diversified portfolio. Obviously, we're concentrated in fewer markets. You have less of this. But I do think -- and we have said from day 1 that we do think that we're in too many markets. And so we do want to focus, and then we can have all the advantages of a portfolio diversification. We don't have to be in 30 countries as where we started. So yes, do expect us to reduce, do expect us to become more efficient, as I think we're doing. I mean, we're -- we've reduced overhead. By next year, we'll be close to 25%. And the longer term, it's more like 1/3. And that's just overhead in terms of managing these businesses. So regarding your question, I do think that we will provide compelling returns. We are in the right markets, markets where there's growth. Chile's growing 5% to 6%. Columbia is growing 5% to 6%, Panama is growing 8%. Even Brazil longer term is expected to be growing at 4% after 1.6% this year. So I think it's hard for you to find another portfolio that has these growth rates, and I think we have a clear strategy for executing on them. So yes, we're not where we want to be at the end, but we've certainly taken big steps in the right direction."

But we've been very successful in mitigating that down and we'll continue to do that. I think in general, our view of -- there has been good support, in our view, of the election results last night.

We do have the tracker, and we believe the majority of those costs will be recovered, as Tom explained. It's pretty straightforward, and we've already submitted our certificate of public convenience and necessity and we're expecting that back relatively shortly. I think I mentioned on the last cost -- call what will make us think about whether we need to go into rates or not is how we deal with potential retirements of older coal units. We are looking at and still evaluating whether we may have to retire up to -- older small coal units, which represent about 15% of our generation. If we do that, we probably will have to bring on new capacity, either self-build or through the RFP process that we engaged in earlier. Once we come to that decision, we would only be able to recover costs associated with that expansion in a rate case. And that's really what's out there. And as we get further along that process, we'll update you probably in the next call where we are, but that's really what Ton was alluding to, the potential that if we deem -- have to do the retirements and we do add in capacity, at that point we will need to consider going through rates so we -- to recover on that investment."

Now in terms of the sales, I mean, I -- we did sell those. I think that we were in a good position to sell for very good multiples quickly, and I think our market timing was very good. Now looking forward, we're going to sell judiciously in the sense that we really want to maximize that -- the value of these. And I can give you just an illustration, is we could have sold and packaged all of our China assets, and we did have offers to sell it right away. But we took our time and sold to separate buyers, and we received a 40% premium versus the sort of altogether. And that's how we're going to continue with these asset sales. So I think that when we have several things under discussions that are -- and when we really do have something that we can bank on, then we will announce it. So we're working hard on this. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and say that we have something until we actually have it signed. So do I feel that if we reached, let's say, $1.7 billion or $1.5 billion, if we got the right prices, then that's probably the right amount. I think what's important is that we got as much value out of it. And the second thing, which is also very important, is do we end up with the optimal company. Do we have the assets that we can administer efficiently that help add to the whole in terms of our synergies and our scale? So what's really important is not just the amount of money that's coming in, but do we end up with the right company at the end of the process."

This is our first dividend, and we will reevaluate it towards the second half of next year. We had always indicated moving towards more sort of an average for the S&P. And I also said that we had a lot of new businesses coming online and that we wanted to see how they all performed before reviewing this. So that was basically it. We're basically looking at what are our cash flows, how are the businesses performing. But I think our intention of giving a portion of our free cash flow back to our investors in the form of a dividend remains strong, and that those are -- that is our objective longer term."

You had indicated that part of the reason why you were changing the growth outlook was DPL and what's going on with the new ESP and also different switching level assumptions. Can you clarify a little bit more? What level of retail switching are you assuming at DPL in your now new outlook? And can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there with regards to switching? I mean, we hear a lot of competitive dynamics coming from FirstEnergy and Exelon and other folks out there, in the space. So what are you guys seeing out there right now?"

Let me talk about our outlook on switching, and I want to sort of put this in the context of the ESP filing, which is essentially our view of Ohio. In the ESP filing, what we've done is we've locked in a view going forward of a switching rate of 62%. That is really what the switching was at the end of August. And we also had proposed somewhere through the AEP case a switching tracker so that fundamentally, we would be able to not have to forecast switching going forward, but that we would be held sort of neutral to switching rates going forward to the outcomes of the rate case. That said, most of the battle right now is around residential customers. We have seen an increase in residential customers switching. It's about 2.5% a month. We see, ending the year, probably around 75% switched. We're seeing most of the categories of customers, other than residential, reaching saturation levels. So that's really what we're seeing. It's mostly been increases in organic switching because I think a lot of the municipal aggregations have slowed down pending the outcome of all the cases and actually the elections that we've just had. So we anticipate that we're going to see continued very intense competition in the residential class. We see that potentially saturating long term at about 80% -- 86% switched. So where competition is intense, so as Andre said, we are replacing more customers than we've lost,  more load than we've lost. But clearly, it's an extremely competitive environment."

Well, this is Andy, and I will talk a little bit about the first part of your question and let Tom talk about the issues around generation restructuring. Getting right to that piece, as you know, the issues that have been around the discussions in the beginning when we filed the MRO and have the settlement discussion, there are 3 main issues. It's time to market of our loads before competitive. It's been the non-bypassable charge. And emerging during those initial settlement discussions have been this question of legal separation of the generation assets even though we believe that the functional separation that we have today actually is fighting competition. What we've done in the filing is we addressed all these issues. We have made -- we are not asking for any approvals to separate generation in the current ESP filing. And as you know, we filed ESP on October 5. What we have done is we made a commitment in the current filing that we will come back by the end of the year with another filing specifically talking about the transition of generation and looking towards legal separation by the end of 2017. With that said, I think that answers part of the structural question. I'm going to ask Tom If he wants to answer the second part of your question."

In general, we've -- we do have debt at DPL, as you probably know, about $900 million at the DP&L level and about $1.7 billion at the DPL holdco level. At least for the next couple of years, we're in reasonably good shape on maturities. We do have a refinancing of about $460 million at DP&L utility next year, and then the first major refinancing for the DPL -- I believe it's August of '14 -- of $400 million-plus. So that's something that we'll look to get ahead on. Obviously, we -- you may have seen that we did have some discussions with the banks before our release last week on modifying some covenants, and that's consistent with our theme of trying to get ahead of things on the financing side."
