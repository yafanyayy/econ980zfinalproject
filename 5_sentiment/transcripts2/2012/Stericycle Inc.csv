Domestic revenues were $316.9 million, of which $287.5 million was domestic-regulated waste and compliance services revenue, and $29.4 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns recalls revenue, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity up 9% and Large Quantity up 6%. International revenues were $129.6 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $2.5 million was up 5%. 
Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $48.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $201.5 million or 45.1% of revenues. SG&A expense was $84.3 million or 18.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.7 million. We have the full quarter impact of the renewal of the senior revolver facility for $1 billion at a spread of 137.5 basis points over LIBOR versus 75 basis points over LIBOR on our prior facility. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $64.3 million or $0.74 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.76 adjusted for acquisition expenses and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $528 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $313 million. In the quarter, we repurchased over 549,000 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $42.9 million. And we have authorization to purchase an additional $4.3 million shares. Capital spending was $16.3 million in the quarter. Our DSO was 59 days. Excluding the third quarter acquisitions, the DSO was 53 days.

For our SQ customers, the growth drivers remain Steri-Safe and Clinical Service compliance programs. And for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste services. 
Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 5 of which were domestic and 3 international. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at -- in the range of 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $150 million.

At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 522,000 accounts, of which over 506,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. We continued to see strong worldwide growth driven by the expanding portfolio services that complement our core regulated waste service. For our SQ customers, the growth drivers remain Steri-Safe and Clinical Service compliance programs. And for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste services. 
Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 5 of which were domestic and 3 international. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at -- in the range of 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. 
I want to close by thanking each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. And now I'll turn it over to Mark."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $2.2 million, and annualized are approximately $10 million. Keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses. 
For 2012, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.21 to $3.26, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on their assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $320 million and $325 million with CapEx anticipated between $60 million and $65 million. 
In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond. We thank you for your time. And operator, we'll now switch over to Q&A."

Domestic revenues were $316.9 million, of which $287.5 million was domestic-regulated waste and compliance services revenue, and $29.4 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns recalls revenue, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity up 9% and Large Quantity up 6%. International revenues were $129.6 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $2.5 million was up 5%. 
Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $48.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $201.5 million or 45.1% of revenues. SG&A expense was $84.3 million or 18.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.7 million. We have the full quarter impact of the renewal of the senior revolver facility for $1 billion at a spread of 137.5 basis points over LIBOR versus 75 basis points over LIBOR on our prior facility. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $64.3 million or $0.74 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.76 adjusted for acquisition expenses and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $528 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $313 million. In the quarter, we repurchased over 549,000 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $42.9 million. And we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares. Capital spending was $16.3 million in the quarter. Our DSO was 59 days. Excluding the third quarter acquisitions, the DSO was 53 days.

For our SQ customers, the growth drivers remain Steri-Safe and Clinical Service compliance programs. And for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste services. 
Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 5 of which were domestic and 3 international. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at -- in the range of 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings.

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $0.7 million, and annualized are approximately $20 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisitions expenses. For 2012, we believe the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $3,24 to $3.28 which we are comfortable with. We believe the analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $320 million to $325 million with CapEx anticipated between $60 million to $65 million. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our Q1 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond. Thank you for your time today. We will now answer any questions. Mike, you can open the Q&A line."

In the quarter, we closed 11 transactions, 6 domestic and 5 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 528,000 accounts, of which over 512,000 were small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. For our LQ customers, the growth drivers were Sharps Management, pharma waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings, and as customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. 
For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for Small Quantity to be at 8% to 10%; Large quantity, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million.

The Pharma Waste, for instance, the multi-site national kind of services that we have, the Integrated Waste Solutions, they don't have the kind of CapEx that goes with the rest of the business. So overall, the cash flow is good that the return we get on those. Yes, it does have that impact on the gross margin, and overall total, it goes up and down a little bit with that and then you get, like you said, the impact in the prior quarters because of the acquisitions."

If you think about EBITDA margins, that trend has also been sort of flat-to-down over sort of a multi-quarter period.

And the gross we said, at that time in the quarter, was about a 40, 50 bp and then an additional 40, 50 bps in the quarter thereafter. So in total, a cumulative 80-bp impact on that acquisition. We do these acquisitions not just based on their contribution, positive or negative to gross margin, we do them based to their good IRR deals, so at the end, it's really a cash flow orientation. So each quarter does have its impact. You can't just generalize and say, hey, if I look back a couple of quarters, because that was a quarter in which we bought 100 million-plus in revenues, and yes, that will change the mix in our business.

In the quarter, we closed 11 transactions, 6 domestic and 5 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 528,000 accounts, of which over 512,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. For our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, pharma waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings, and as customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. 
For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for Small Quantity to be at 8% to 10%; Large Quantity, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million.

The Pharma Waste, for instance, the multi-site national kind of services that we have, the Integrated Waste Solutions, they don't have the kind of CapEx that goes with the rest of the business.

We do these acquisitions not just based on their contribution, positive or negative, to gross margin, we do them based that they’re good IRR deals, so at the end, it's really a cash flow orientation. So each quarter does have its impact.

In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 3 domestic and 5 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 535,000 accounts, of which over 519,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. And for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings. 
We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt a multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million.

In Q2 of 2011, an internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues was up 8%. Domestic revenues were $337.9 million of which $308.9 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues, and $29 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues was up 9%, consisting of SQ, up 10%, and LQ, up 8%; International revenues were $131.1 million and internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $8.1 million, was up 5%. Acquisitions contributed $36.6 million to the growth in the quarter, of which $2.7 million related to the Recalls and Returns business. 
Gross profit was $209.5 million, or 44.7% of revenues. SG&A expense was $88 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.7 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $67.6 million or $0.78 per share on an as-reported basis, and 81% adjusted for acquisition and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $516 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $328 million. Our capital spend in the quarter was $16.8 million. And our DSO was 58 days.

In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 3 domestic and 5 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 535,000 accounts, of which over 519,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. And for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings. 
We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; International, 5% to 8%; and Recall and Returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million.

Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 535,000 accounts, of which over 519,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. And for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings. 
We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; International, 5% to 8%; and Recall and Returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million. 
We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. A special thanks to our Spanish team for their great cash collections efforts in the quarter. I'll turn it over to Charlie."

Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $3 million and annualized are approximately $41 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses. 
For 2012, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.26 to $3.29, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $322 million to $330 million, with CapEx anticipated between $63 million to $65 million. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our Q2 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond. Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Mike, you can open up the Q&A queue."

Domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues was up 9%, consisting of SQ, up 10%, and LQ, up 8%; International revenues were $131.1 million and internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $8.1 million, was up 5%. Acquisitions contributed $36.6 million to the growth in the quarter, of which $2.7 million related to the Recalls and Returns business. 
Gross profit was $209.5 million, or 44.7% of revenues. SG&A expense was $88 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.7 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $67.6 million or $0.78 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.81 adjusted for acquisition and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $516 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $328 million. Our capital spend in the quarter was $16.8 million. And our DSO was 58 days.

In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 3 domestic and 5 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 535,000 accounts, of which over 519,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. And for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings. 
We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; International, 5% to 8%; and Recall and Returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million.

Keep in mind, our 2012 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses. For 2012, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.27 to $3.29, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.87 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $319 million to $327 million, with CapEx anticipated between $65 million to $68 million. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary outlook for 2013. Keep in mind our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. We believe analyst's EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.62 to $3.67, including the impact of the private placement and a share count of $87.5 million, which we are comfortable with. 
We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.09 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; International, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $105 million and $120 million. 
We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $350 million to $355 million. CapEx is anticipated to be between $65 million to $70 million.

The returns management internal growth was $3 million, positive, so you deduct that because we did the calculation excluding the recalls so that get you to $32.9 million in kind of the growth year-over-year. And then you divide that by a number that you first look at your total revenues for '11, you again deduct that $11 million on acquisitions from it and then the internal RMS number, which is $23.1 million, and that get you to then $386.8 million, so $32.9 million divided by the $386.8 million, that gives you 8.5%."

And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 8.5%. Domestic revenues were $348.2 million, of which $319.5 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services and $28.7 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls revenues, was up over 10% consisting of SQ, up 11%, and LQ up 9%. International revenues were $132.3 million and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $8 million, was up 4%. Acquisitions contributed $31.5 million to the growth in the quarter, of which $0.6 million related to the recalls and returns business. 
Gross profit was $215.6 million or 44.9% of revenues. And SG&A expense was $90.2 million, or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.9 million and the net income attributable to Stericycle was $65.5 million or $0.75 per share on a reported basis and $0.84 adjusted for acquisitions and other non-recurring expenses. 
Now the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.22 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $610 million. On October 22, we signed 2 private placements for a total of $250 million. This includes $125 million, 7-year note at a rate of 2.68% and $125 million 10-year note at a rate of 3.26%. The proceeds will be used to reduce existing borrowings. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 43,500 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $3.9 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.2 million shares. Our capital spending was $17.8 million, our DSO was 60 days and Q3 year-to-date cash provided from operations was $277 million.

In the quarter, we closed 12 transactions, 3 domestic and 9 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool room remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 537,000 accounts, of which over 521,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. 
The strong internal growth rates we experienced in this quarter resulted from more and more customers adopting our expanding portfolio of offerings. For our SQ customers, these include Steri-Safe and other compliance services; and for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Solutions. We remain very excited about our future growth because today, 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. And as customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. 
We want to take this opportunity to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Charlie."

I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2012 and 2013. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.
Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $3.8 million, and annualized, are approximately $33.7 million. Keep in mind, our 2012 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. For 2012, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.27 to $3.29, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.87 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $319 million to $327 million, with CapEx anticipated between $65 million to $68 million. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary outlook for 2013. Keep in mind our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. We believe analyst's EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.62 to $3.67, including the impact of the private placement and a  share count of 87.5 million, which we are comfortable with. 
We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.09 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; International, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $105 million and $120 million. 
We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $350 million to $355 million. CapEx is anticipated to be between $65 million to $70 million. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond. Thank you for your time. We'll now open it up to Q&A. Mike, you can open up the Q&A line."

Now the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.22 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $610 million.

The proceeds will be used to reduce existing borrowings. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 43,500 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $3.9 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.2 million shares.

I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2012 and 2013. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.
Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $3.8 million, and annualized, are approximately $33.7 million. Keep in mind, our 2012 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. For 2012, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.27 to $3.29, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.87 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $319 million to $327 million, with CapEx anticipated between $65 million to $68 million. 
Now I'd like to provide a preliminary outlook for 2013. Keep in mind our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses.
We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.62 to $3.67, including the impact of the private placement and a share count of 87.5 million, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.09 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $105 million and $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $350 million to $355 million. CapEx is anticipated to be between $65 million to $70 million. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond. Thank you for your time. We'll now open it up to Q&A. Mike, you can open up the Q&A line."
