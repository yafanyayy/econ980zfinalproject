The cyclical recovery in commercial real estate is now entering its third year. As we predicted in late 2010, the current recovery is slower, more uneven and more difficult to forecast than those we've experienced in the past. As a result, the relative contributions from our various service lines and geographies in 2011 were a bit different than we had originally envisioned.
Nevertheless, we provided earnings guidance at the outset of 2011, reaffirmed that guidance during the course of the year and now have produced full year results at the high end of our guidance range.
We are pleased with this outcome. It underscores our ability to deliver on the expectations we set for our shareholders as we do for our clients. And we thank and acknowledge our CBRE colleagues around the world for another in a series of terrific years.
For the full year 2011, revenue increased 15% to almost $6 billion. And normalized EBITDA increased to $803 million both second best in company history behind 2007. Normalized EBITDA margin for the year grew to 13.6%. Normalized diluted earnings per share came in at $1.03 which is almost 40% above full year 2010 and as I mentioned near the top end of our $0.95 to $1.05 guidance range. Total Q4 2011 revenues were $1.8 billion, a 7% increase over Q4 2010, with positive revenue growth in every region.
Outsourcing growth continued its strong pace with a total increase of 14% and double-digit contributions from all regions. Investment sales revenue increased 10%, driven by continued growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, while EMEA remained relatively flat in light of continued sovereign debt issues in the region.
While recent revenues exceeded 2007 peak levels for the full year, in Q4 2011 they declined 4% as compared to Q4 2010. This decline resulted from a decrease in the Americas, while EMEA and Asia-Pacific leasing continued to grow. The decrease in Americas leasing compares to Q4 2010 that grew 45% versus Q4 2009 and was also indicative of the continued lack of meaningful U.S. job growth.
Asset management fees more than doubled, primarily due to contributions from businesses acquired from ING during the year. These revenue gains were partially offset by a lack of carried interest revenue, which was almost $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Normalized EBITDA increased to $350 million in Q4 2011 from $253 million in Q4 2010. Our Q4 normalized EBITDA margin was 17.8% versus 15.3% in Q4 2010. This very impressive 250 basis point margin expansion was partially attributable to cost reduction actions we took during and preceding Q4 2011, some of which were reflected in the $31 million cost containment charge we recorded during the quarter.
We are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will improve in 2012, but our onboarding new expense at a measured pace, in order to protect and enhance margins and profitability in 2012. Some have been most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on Slide 5. As usual, I will not go through them individually, but we have included them for your review.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Gil to go over the financial results in detail. Gil?

As Brett already mentioned, total revenue was $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up 7% from last year. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management, commercial mortgage brokerage and development services.
Normalized EBITDA grew at a much faster pace than revenue, up 24% to $314.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $253.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 17.8%, our highest quarterly normalized EBITDA margin since the second quarter of 2007.
In the fourth quarter of 2011 in our regional segments, we recognized cost containment expenses totaling $31.1 million, of which $20 million was in cost of services and $11.1 million was in operating expenses. The Americas totaled $15.6 million, EMEA totaled $11.1 million and Asia-Pacific totaled $4.4 million.
These costs were predominantly related to severance for approximately 500 positions globally. This action was taken to calibrate our staffing levels to the current market environment and was executed with care to among other things and showed no impact on the delivery of client service. We expect resulting savings of approximately $40 million in 2012 from these actions.
Our cost of services increased to 57.2% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus 56.4% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the cost containment expenses just mentioned, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 56.1% for the fourth quarter of 2011, a slight decrease versus 56.3% in the prior-year quarter.
Fourth quarter 2011 operating expenses were 34.2% of total revenue versus 31.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the cost containment expenses and integration in other costs related to ING REIM, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 31% for the fourth quarter of 2011, a slight decrease versus 31.2% in the prior-year quarter. This decrease was despite the inclusion of ING REIM operating expenses all of which flow to the operating expense line as oppose to cost of services.
Interest expense increased slightly by $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the ING REIM and sterling term loan A1 financings, partially offset by lower interest rates, resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our fourth quarter 2011 tax rate was approximately 38%, resulting in a full year tax rate of approximately 40%. We expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be slightly below 2011's rate, primarily due to a mix shift from the inclusion of ING REIM for a full year. Our Q4 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.25 versus $0.30 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.46 versus $0.36 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Please turn to Slide 7. Due in part to seasonality and even with a 4% percent decline on a year-over-year basis, leasing was our largest service line in the fourth quarter of 2011, with revenue of $590.8 million and represented 33% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 4% decrease was partly due to a tough comparison in the U.S. versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
Leasing revenue for the full year 2011 set a new record for the company at $1.91 billion, surpassing the 2007 peak revenue year of $1.87 billion. Property and facilities management was our second largest service line in the fourth quarter of 2011, representing 31% of total revenue in the quarter with a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010.
Investment sales showed a solid increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and accounted for 18% of fourth quarter 2011 revenues in its seasonally strongest quarter. Appraisal and valuation revenue was relatively flat as compared to last year at $108.9 million due to an outside valuation fee recorded in China in the prior year fourth quarter, largely offset by an acquisition in Asia-Pacific in the second quarter of 2011 and higher revenues in EMEA.
Global investment and management revenue increased 44% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in asset management fees, largely attributable to the ING REIM businesses that we acquired. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue posted one of our strongest quarterly year-over-year increases with 25% growth driven by strong capital availability, also low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors continued search for yield. Development services revenue was up 7%.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 56% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 8. Outsourcing business growth remains strong this quarter with revenue up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. This was driven by new account growth, client renewals and expansions, as well as acquisitions in EMEA. Strong performance was evident across all regions particularly EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, contract activity remains solid with 13 year account signed, 10 renewals and 10 expansions.
We are very pleased to cross a major performance milestone in outsourcing in 2011 that being the $2 billion revenue mark. We are even more pleased that there is plenty of room to grow this business line particularly outside the Americas. And we continue to target higher milestone.
Slide 9 demonstrate the stabilized or improving vacancy rates and positive absorption in all three market sectors depicted, along with our forecasted improvement over the next two years. Average national office cap rates remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2011 and showed slight year-over-year improvement primarily due to strength in core and Class A property sales.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sales revenue in the Americas continued to be strong with a 15% increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our U.S. Investment Sales market shared totaled 16.4% for the fourth quarter of 2011 according to real capital analytics which represented a significant 110 basis points improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2010 market share of 15.3%. Our lead over the number two firm was more than 500 basis points.
Our Americas leasing revenue decreased 9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, largely due to a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of 2010 when revenue rose 45% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and as a result of our lack of meaningful employment growth. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the U.S. occupancy rates fell by 20 basis points to 16% from the third quarter of 2011. The Americas outsourcing business grew 10% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and full year Americas outsourcing revenue improved 12% in 2011.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our EMEA investment sales revenue was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Pockets of strength were evident in Northern Europe. CBRE's EMEA leasing revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These positive results were achieved despite heightened macro economic issues in the region and were driven by Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.
Outsourcing continued its strong rate with revenue increasing 17% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010 driven by new assignment. However, revenue mix shift into outsourcing did have a slightly negative impact on EMEAs normalized EBITDA margins this quarter which was mitigated through cost controls resulting in an overall normalized EBITDA margin increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Please turn to Slide 12. CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily driven by China and Japan. CBRE’s leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The strongest gains came from Australia, Japan and India partially offset by Singapore where the market has cooled as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Asia Pacific saw outsourcing growth of 36% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010, as it continues to gain adoption in this region. The strongest contributions were from Australia, China and India.
Asia Pacific's fourth quarter 2011 normalized EBITDA margin was negatively impacted as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the outsized valuation we recorded  in China in the prior year as well as the expansion in that country.
Please turn to slide 13. Revenue for the Development Services segment increased 15% to $22.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher development in project management fees.
Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2011 reflected normalized EBITDA of $52.1 million, a significant improvement over prior year that was driven by the sale of several high quality assets including two of particular note in the Houston and Dallas markets respectively. These two sales contributed approximately $33 million of net gain to the company in the fourth quarter of 2011.
At year end 2011, in process development totaled $4.9 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.2 billion. At the end of the year, our equity co-investments in the development services business totaled $79.2 million.
Please turn to Slide 14. Let me quickly recap for you the pertinent details of our ING REIM acquisition. On July 1, 2011, we closed on ING Clarion Real Estate Securities for $324 million and $59 million in co-investments. On October 3, 2011, we closed on ING REIM Asia for $46 million and $14 million in co-investments. On October 31, 2011, we closed on ING REIM Europe for $443 million and $7 million in co-investments. This totaled $813 million in purchase price and $80 million in co-investments as well as $67 million in transaction and integration costs through yearend.
The assets under management or AUM associated with this acquisition were $62.4 billion as calculated at yearend 2011. The remaining potential cash needs for this acquisition are additional purchase price of approximately $80 million, if certain assets are transferred to us, up to approximately $70 million in potential additional co-investments and approximately $79 million in additional transaction and integration costs. The total cost of this transaction, including these remaining potential costs, is in line with our original estimates.
As you may recall, we financed the acquisition with cash and two $400 million tranches of term loans during 2018 and 2019 respectively that are at terms of LIBOR plus 325 and 350 respectively and no liable floors.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, our global investment management segment's revenue was up 35% to $107.8 million from $79.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees primarily stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM, which contributed approximately $60 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. This contribution was partially offset by the absence of any carried interest revenue in the quarter. In last year's fourth quarter, we recognized $19.9 million of carried interest revenue as well as moderately higher acquisition fees and rental revenue.
AUM totaled $94.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, up about 150% from yearend 2010, primarily due to the inclusion of ING REIM assets added in the fourth quarter which totaled $41.1 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2011, total AUM in the direct real estate business was impacted by $1.2 billion of asset acquisitions other than ING REIM, $2.1 billion of dispositions and transfers and $100 million of improvement in asset values. In addition, currency fluctuations lowered AUM by $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011.
For the full year 2011, in the direct real estate business, we raised new capital of approximately $2.5 billion and had approximately $2.7 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Included in the $94.1 billion in AUM at the end of 2011 was $19.8 billion of listed securities. Net inflows and changes in market valuation of the securities portfolio increased AUM by $1.3 billion in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011. Our co-investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $169.6 million.
Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 15. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we incurred $45 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisitions primarily for legal and other professional services, retention and severance. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $10.5 million of carried interest compensation expense which relates to carried interest revenue that we expect to realize in future periods.
As of December 31, 2011, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $44 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 25% for the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 was a result of reduced carried interest revenue, the reversal of a significant provision for doubtful accounts related to a specific fund and larger equity earnings in the prior-year fourth quarter, partially offset by the EBITDA contribution from ING REIM.
Please turn to Slide 16. Slide 16 shows the amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. On November 10, 2011, we closed on a senior secured sterling-denominated term loan A1 facility in the amount of approximately $300 million due in May 2016 with favorable returns substantially similar to our existing term loan A facility.
We remain very comfortable with our balance debt maturity profile with no meaningful maturities until 2015. We're also please with our strong overall balance sheet position as it provides us the flexibility to capitalize on additional strategic growth opportunities and other corporate initiatives.
Please turn into Slide 17. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use, our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of 2011 was approximately $1.6 billion. This represents an increase from yearend 2010, primarily due to term loan borrowings to finance the acquisition of ING REIM.
At yearend 2011, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.3% compared to 5.5% at the end of the third quarter of 2011. The lower average interest rate was primarily driven by the senior secured sterling term loan A1 completed in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.53 times at the end of 2011 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to EBITDA stood at 2.05 times, which is significantly lower than the 2.5 times we projected that this ratio would be following the acquisition of all of ING REIM.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett.

We believe that the commercial real estate market will continue to recover in 2012 despite continued macro challenges. As for our business, we expect to grow both earnings and normalized EBITDA margins even in this soft transaction environment.
Outsourcing of revenue is likely to grow in the low-double digits, one of the faster growth rates among our service lines. Investment sales will grow in line with a broader economic recovery with core assets still being the driver, but with increasing contribution from secondary market recoveries.
Leasing growth rates will likely be modest and heavily weighted toward the third and fourth quarters. Any revenue increase in this business would be driven by meaningful employment growth and rental rate improvement in the Americas and elsewhere.
EBITDA in investment management will be higher than 2011 due to full year impact of the businesses acquired from ING, while development services EBITDA will be lower due to large gains Gil mentioned we achieved in 2011. By taking advantage of the revenue growth drivers just mentioned and continuing our focus on effective cost controls, our goal is to again achieve 2012 normalized EBITDA margins greater than we achieved in 2011.
It is important to note that 2012 performance is likely to be more backend loaded than usual due to the slow transaction environment we have experienced in the heightened market uncertainty. Our outlook for 2012 assumes a pickup in job growth, economic activity and sentiment by the summer.
Giving due consideration to all of these factors as well as anticipated higher interest depreciation and amortization expense mainly as a result of the inclusion of ING REIM for the full year, we currently anticipate that full year 2012 normalized earnings per share will be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25. As we told you last year, forecasting EPS in an environment such as this is exceptionally difficult. We may very well update this guidance throughout the year as full year trends become clear.
With that, operator, we're ready for questions.

I think the bottomline for us is we have a very, very strong commercial leasing business in most of the major world markets, but there is no doubt that it's getting more competitive everyday. And I think what you're going to see by the way is, and this is very consistent with what we've been talking about for years, this business is rapidly consolidating down to a very small number of players. And the trend you're referring to, that player along with us I believe is going to capture the vast majority of the available share going forward. And I suspect the quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, those numbers will move a bit back and forth.
That trend is absolute. And I suspect that the mid-tier firms and the smaller firms, you're just going to see them lose more and more share every quarter and every year and move more of that share on board to these two firms that are the demonstrated market leaders.
I think I'm pleased with the position we have in the major markets, and I think that at the same time, we've got a lot of work to do to retain that number one position in every major world market, because it's under attack everywhere and it's something that we pay attention to. But, yes, I'm generally pleased with results.

And I don't have the statistic for the fourth quarter. Our loss rate is almost zero. It's a very, very rare day that a client terminates us in that space and goes with somebody else and we un-board it, in 2011 and particularly in the fourth quarter, some very impressive clients. I think what you're going to see, Anthony, in 2012 and going forward is that this market is advancing much more quickly than we thought it would. That's good news and it's advancing globally, also more quickly than we thought it would and that's also very good news.
Yet its no secret to you, these contracts come with significant upfront cost and they can be punishing to short term margins, although we price them and make absolutely certain as we price them that one those accounts stabilize, their run rates margins are very good. But you're going to see I think forever and going forward and you've seen in 2011 that these are very expensive accounts that come in with real cost and for quarter or two they can materially hurt a margins a bit but if you have an no problem, they're hit and run rate we can cover all that more with the terrific performance of the existing accounts. But we're really, really excited about that business. And you saw that more than half of our gross in the fourth quarter came from outsourcing.

It's a rare day that our outsourcing contract renews and we get paid more for doing the same work. We got paid to time before. These clients are heavily, heavily focused on cost that's why they put the contracts out and every time you renew it they're grind. 
So I would just tell you that in this business the ability to push pricing is almost non-existent which wouldn't therefore extrapolate to that 14% being primarily new accounts or the addition of new services to existing accounts. Now that is where the renewals get exciting for us because once we prove ourselves with newer generation accounts, we are allowed to perform additional services to them and many times the additional services could bring in the great margins not the original services we were hired for.
I think, Anthony, we've gone over that with you and the other callers many times but facilities management many times is a lead. Facilities management is a decent margin business but nothing to get excited about. But it's the additional services that we can sell through that push those margins and those many times come at renewal or later.

I know you understand all this but we have some colors that are probably telling new story.

And also because we need to preserve a decent amount of cash to payout bonuses, we have 31,000 employees and many of those are bonusable and so, those numbers add up as Gil just mentioned.
Given where we are in the cycle, we see lots of opportunity out there to grow the business not just organically but through acquisitions and so having this cash on the balance sheet as opposed to using it for other things. To us, it's a wise move at the moment. And that's, as Gil mentioned, you're seeing that the combined dynamics of saving for bonuses plus opportunities in market moving up that cash number a bit higher than we usually have it.

However the pipeline beyond that is almost non existent because the way in which these company's higher services. This is not a business, it's very interesting actually, Sloan, this is not a business.
We have the big marketing force out cold calling major corporations and trying to convince them to outsource. But the process to get a company to do that is long-lived. And by the way the momentum to do it is so strong at the moment that most of our work is something responding to our fees that are coming in the door and making decisions around which I repeat we think are worth chasing and which we're just going to let go by the way side.
I would tell you that the short-term pipeline looks really good and all the trends, long-term trends that we would look at to support future growth in that business look very strong as well.
So said another way, it's purely subjective not objective. But I would tell you that if there were a 12-month or an 18-month pipeline, it would look very strong right now. And I get that by extrapolating the macros that we watch around that industry. We have a number of very significant contracts that we've won in the past two years. And we certainly expect those contracts at this point, it will be embedded down or getting close to be embedded down.
But because this business is growing so fast right now and this is what I was trying to lead to earlier in probably not very well, because it's growing so fast right now. We've go a lot of business coming to door right now, this going to require some upfront cost. And I think that what the net of impact on all that is that because so much new business is coming in, the margins in that business might be a little bit soft until this rate of new business coming in plateaus and we have a chance to bid down these many, many clients, we've got coming in the door.
I don't remember the specific number, and Gil, what comes to memory is something like a 173 accounts of one form or another that came-in in 2011. But you get a sense for the velocity this business and the way in which we have to approach those accounts and onboard cost for those accounts. And then manage them going forward.

We don't have any pricing power, none. And we get into the bid process and we know what the margins we want. As a client for whatever reason is unrolling to pay those margins we drop out. And so I suppose the net effect of all that is it kind of feels like pricing power but it's more turning down accounts that are not profitable in that force and only pursuing those that are. And I've talked about this I think it's going to be a long, long time before in the outsourcing business any provider really has a pricing power to speak of.
I do believe that even right now in the first quarter of 2012, I do believe that all the service providers have done a much better job of educating these clients around the idea that it makes sense to pay reasonable pricing with a reasonable margin for these services, because what's happened to number of these clients is they've done and they've hired or they're consulting even worse, they're consultants find out and hired a low margin, low cost bidder. Six months into the contract they calls up and ask them to help them out because there provider is failing miserably. They don't have the platform, they didn't price it right. We make sure we'll remind those clients that we're happy to do it, but there is a reason why we dropped out of the bid.
And that's happening less and less as those failures are more obvious and I think in public and that is allowing the marketplace I think the price, the business at our free process a bid better for us. They may did in the past. This is just not a business that I think any smart corporation or owner for that matter would want to choose a low cost provider. It is far too strategic to what they do. And the risks to choosing the wrong provider are far too large. And that helps pricing as well.

And as you well know and most of the callers are very well aware, we're in this very odd recovery. Its fits and starts, it's incremental. And it is so skeptical at the moment to settlement either positive or negative, settlement at house outsized impacts on the market. So when we see a shock to this system which may actually but not be material. It can freeze the credit market. And certainly you folks know this even better than I do. And when you see a single good jobs report like what came out last week, this is euphoria that everything is gotten entirely better, neither a true.
And so because of that what the capital markets need is just a period of time of quiet of no new big news. And I'm hopeful that 2012 may actually be the year where that happens and that what we get is a return to a more normal recovery/extension cycle, and we have not had one to date since the bottom of the downturn and that's what we need.
So when you begin to see financing loosen up fairly quickly, you may recall and our callers may recall that by the spring of 2011, a sentiment was things were getting better quickly, the first quarter and most of the second quarter. And the secondary property markets being to see a lot of action in that kind of May, June timeframe. And then we get a shock again and everything shut down again, and all the money went back to core.
That kind of bunker mentality, anytime there is a buy check, exists very much today, just as it did last year and the year before. And those secondary markets, I believe are not going to get real action and real traction until the recovery has a chance to operate in a normal fashion as without big negative shock.

And that was the entirety of the change quarter-over-quarter in the leasing revenues rents were it was very little change in rents in the quarter. And there was a very little change in square footage.
And by the way, what we're seeing in that marketplace, as you would expect with the type of economy we're dealing with right now is of all the business lines we have leasing in the U.S. is the one acting most abnormal through a typical recovery cycle. And the reason of course, and this is obviously, I know that you David and everyone else, the reason for that is the job growth is so muted.
So in a typical recovery you have a combined impact of rental rate growth, which tends to move very quickly, up in recovery cycle and wrap a job growth, which tends to move very quickly up. We don't have either of those right now, because of the type of very, very incremental recovery rent.
We believe both of those are coming. And I think as most of you know, in 2011, I believe the number was 56 million square feet of construction was brought to the market in United States, which is the absolute lowest amount of new constructions since the numbers were kept in 1960.
What it tells you is, you have a lot of people out there right now, who are not willing to build a new building and lenders unwilling to lend on one. But what also tells us is, is that when the recovery gets its legs and we get real job growth, rents could move up very, very quickly, because the inventory number is artificially constrained right now.
But, David, the answer to your question was, it was purely velocity. And our comments on the scripted portion of the call, way the leasing our expectation is, is that leasing is going to remain very muted until we see meaningful job growth. And our projections are based on a lot of different data points is that we think that's a Q3, Q4 event and Q1 and Q2 on leasing will be relatively flat perhaps nominally up or nominally down, it's not going to move much.
The surprise, if we get, one will be up. I think the level leasing we're seeing right now is pretty much dial tone. We're also now working off of compares that are quite strong, as you saw, the leasing number for 2011 was a record high. So we are at a high level. I don't see a lot of growth in that until we see real job growth. And hopefully, we're going to see that second-half figure.

The cyclical recovery in commercial real estate is now entering its third year. As we predicted in late 2010, the current recovery is slower, more uneven and more difficult to forecast than those we've experienced in the past. As a result, the relative contributions from our various service lines and geographies in 2011 were a bit different than we had originally envisioned.
Nevertheless, we provided earnings guidance at the outset of 2011, reaffirmed that guidance during the course of the year and now have produced full year results at the high end of our guidance range.
We are pleased with this outcome. It underscores our ability to deliver on the expectations we set for our shareholders as we do for our clients. And we thank and acknowledge our CBRE colleagues around the world for another in a series of terrific years.
For the full year 2011, revenue increased 15% to almost $6 billion. And normalized EBITDA increased to $803 million both second best in company history behind 2007. Normalized EBITDA margin for the year grew to 13.6%. Normalized diluted earnings per share came in at $1.03 which is almost 40% above full year 2010 and as I mentioned near the top end of our $0.95 to $1.05 guidance range. Total Q4 2011 revenues were $1.8 billion, a 7% increase over Q4 2010, with positive revenue growth in every region.
Outsourcing growth continued its strong pace with a total increase of 14% and double-digit contributions from all regions. Investment sales revenue increased 10%, driven by continued growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, while EMEA remained relatively flat in light of continued sovereign debt issues in the region.
While leasing revenues exceeded 2007 peak levels for the full year, in Q4 2011 they declined 4% as compared to Q4 2010. This decline resulted from a decrease in the Americas, while EMEA and Asia-Pacific leasing continued to grow. The decrease in Americas leasing compares to Q4 2010 that grew 45% versus Q4 2009 and was also indicative of the continued lack of meaningful U.S. job growth.
Asset management fees more than doubled, primarily due to contributions from businesses acquired from ING during the year. These revenue gains were partially offset by a lack of carried interest revenue, which was almost $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Normalized EBITDA increased to $315 million in Q4 2011 from $253 million in Q4 2010. Our Q4 normalized EBITDA margin was 17.8% versus 15.3% in Q4 2010. This very impressive 250 basis point margin expansion was partially attributable to cost reduction actions we took during and preceding Q4 2011, some of which were reflected in the $31 million cost containment charge we recorded during the quarter.
We are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will improve in 2012, but our onboarding new expense at a measured pace, in order to protect and enhance margins and profitability in 2012. Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on Slide 5. As usual, I will not go through them individually, but we have included them for your review.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Gil to go over the financial results in detail. Gil?"

As Brett already mentioned, total revenue was $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up 7% from last year. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management, commercial mortgage brokerage and development services.
Normalized EBITDA grew at a much faster pace than revenue, up 24% to $314.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $253.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 17.8%, our highest quarterly normalized EBITDA margin since the second quarter of 2007.
In the fourth quarter of 2011 in our regional segments, we recognized cost containment expenses totaling $31.1 million, of which $20 million was in cost of services and $11.1 million was in operating expenses. The Americas totaled $15.6 million, EMEA totaled $11.1 million and Asia-Pacific totaled $4.4 million.
These costs were predominantly related to severance for approximately 500 positions globally. This action was taken to calibrate our staffing levels to the current market environment and was executed with care to among other things ensure no impact on the delivery of client service. We expect resulting savings of approximately $40 million in 2012 from these actions.
Our cost of services increased to 57.2% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus 56.4% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the cost containment expenses just mentioned, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 56.1% for the fourth quarter of 2011, a slight decrease versus 56.3% in the prior-year quarter.
Fourth quarter 2011 operating expenses were 34.2% of total revenue versus 31.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the cost containment expenses and integration in other costs related to ING REIM, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 31% for the fourth quarter of 2011, a slight decrease versus 31.2% in the prior-year quarter. This decrease was despite the inclusion of ING REIM operating expenses all of which flow through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services.
Interest expense increased slightly by $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the ING REIM and sterling term loan A1 financings, partially offset by lower interest rates, resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our fourth quarter 2011 tax rate was approximately 38%, resulting in a full year tax rate of approximately 40%. We expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be slightly below 2011's rate, primarily due to a mix shift from the inclusion of ING REIM for a full year. Our Q4 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.25 versus $0.30 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.46 versus $0.36 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Please turn to Slide 7. Due in part to seasonality and even with a 4% percent decline on a year-over-year basis, leasing was our largest service line in the fourth quarter of 2011, with revenue of $590.8 million, it represented 33% of total company revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 4% decrease was partly due to a tough comparison in the U.S. versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
Leasing revenue for the full year 2011 set a new record for the company at $1.91 billion, surpassing the 2007 peak revenue year of $1.87 billion. Property and facilities management was our second largest service line in the fourth quarter of 2011, representing 31% of total revenue in the quarter with a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010.
Investment sales showed a solid increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and accounted for 18% of fourth quarter 2011 revenues in its seasonally strongest quarter. Appraisal and valuation revenue was relatively flat as compared to last year at $108.9 million due to an outside valuation fee recorded in China in the prior year fourth quarter, largely offset by an acquisition in Asia-Pacific in the second quarter of 2011 and higher revenues in EMEA.
Global investment and management revenue increased 44% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in asset management fees, largely attributable to the ING REIM businesses that we acquired. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue posted one of our strongest quarterly year-over-year increases with 25% growth driven by strong capital availability, ultra low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors continued search for yield. Development services revenue was up 7%.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 56% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 8. Outsourcing business growth remains strong this quarter with revenue up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. This was driven by new account growth, client renewals and expansions, as well as acquisitions in EMEA. Strong performance was evident across all regions particularly EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, contract activity remains solid with 13 year account signed, 10 renewals and 10 expansions.
We are very pleased to cross a major performance milestone in outsourcing in 2011 that being the $2 billion revenue mark. We are even more pleased that there is plenty of room to grow this business line particularly outside the Americas. And we continue to target higher milestones.
Slide 9 demonstrate the stabilized or improving vacancy rates and positive absorption in all 3 market sectors depicted, along with our forecasted improvement over the next 2 years. Average national office cap rates remained stable in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the third quarter of 2011 and showed slight year-over-year improvement primarily due to strength in core and Class A property sales.
Please turn to Slide 10. Sales revenue in the Americas continued to be strong with a 15% increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our U.S. Investment Sales market share totaled 16.4% for the fourth quarter of 2011 according to real capital analytics which represented a significant 110 basis points improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2010 market share of 15.3%. Our lead over the number 2 firm was more than 500 basis points.
Our Americas leasing revenue decreased 9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, largely due to a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of 2010 when revenue rose 45% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and as a result of a lack of meaningful employment growth. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the U.S. office vacancy rate fell by 20 basis points to 16% from the third quarter of 2011. The Americas outsourcing business grew 10% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and full year Americas outsourcing revenue improved 12% in 2011.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our EMEA investment sales revenue was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Pockets of strength were evident in Northern Europe. CBRE's EMEA leasing revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These positive results were achieved despite heightened macro economic issues in the region and were driven by Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.
Outsourcing continued its strong growth rate with revenue increasing 17% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010 driven by new assignment. However, revenue mix shift into outsourcing did have a slightly negative impact on EMEAs normalized EBITDA margins this quarter which was mitigated through cost controls resulting in an overall normalized EBITDA margin increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Please turn to Slide 12. CBRE sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily driven by China and Japan. CBRE’s leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The strongest gains came from Australia, Japan and India partially offset by Singapore where the market has cooled as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Asia Pacific saw outsourcing growth of 36% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010, as it continues to gain adoption in this region. The strongest contributions were from Australia, China and India.
Asia Pacific's fourth quarter 2011 normalized EBITDA margin was negatively impacted as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the outsized valuation fee recorded in China in the prior year as well as business expansion in that country.
Please turn to Slide 13. Revenue for the Development Services segment increased 15% to $22.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher development in project management fees.
Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2011 reflected normalized EBITDA of $52.1 million, a significant improvement over the prior year that was driven by the sale of several high quality assets including 2 of particular note in the Houston and Dallas markets respectively. These 2 sales contributed approximately $33 million of net gain to the company in the fourth quarter of 2011.
At year end 2011, in process development totaled $4.9 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.2 billion. At the end of the year, our equity co-investments in the development services business totaled $79.2 million.
Please turn to Slide 14. Let me quickly recap for you the pertinent details of our ING REIM acquisition. First, I'll review the businesses we bought and when each closed. On July 1, 2011, we closed on ING Clarion Real Estate Securities for $324 million and $59 million in co-investments. On October 3, 2011, we closed on ING REIM Asia for $46 million and $14 million in co-investments. On October 31, 2011, we closed on ING REIM Europe for $443 million and $7 million in co-investments. This totaled $813 million in purchase price and $80 million in co-investments as well as $67 million in transaction and integration costs through year end.
The assets under management or AUM associated with this acquisition were $62.4 billion as calculated at year end 2011. The remaining potential cash needs for this acquisition are additional purchase price of approximately $80 million, if certain assets are transferred to us, up to approximately $70 million in potential additional co-investments and approximately $79 million in additional transaction and integration costs. The total cost of this transaction, including these remaining potential costs, is in line with our original estimates.
As you may recall, we financed the acquisition with cash and 2, $400 million tranches of term loans during 2018 and 2019 respectively that have terms of LIBOR plus 325 and 350 respectively and no liable floors.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, our global investment management segment's revenue was up 35% to $107.8 million from $79.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees primarily stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM, which contributed approximately $60 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. This contribution was partially offset by the absence of any carried interest revenue in the quarter. In last year's fourth quarter, we recognized $19.9 million of carried interest revenue as well as moderately higher acquisition fees and rental revenue.
AUM totaled $94.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, up about 150% from year end 2010, primarily due to the inclusion of ING REIM assets added in the fourth quarter which totaled $41.1 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2011, total AUM in the direct real estate business was impacted by $1.2 billion of asset acquisitions other than ING REIM, $2.1 billion of dispositions and transfers and $100 million of improvement in asset values. In addition, currency fluctuations lowered AUM by $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011.
For the full year 2011, in the direct real estate business, we raised new capital of approximately $2.5 billion and had approximately $2.7 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Included in the $94.1 billion in AUM at the end of 2011 was $19.8 billion of listed securities. Net inflows and changes in market valuation of the securities portfolio increased AUM by $1.3 billion in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011. Our co-investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $169.6 million.
Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 15. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we incurred $45 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisitions primarily for legal and other professional services, retention and severance. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $10.5 million of carried interest compensation expense which relates to carried interest revenue that we expect to realize in future periods.
As of December 31, 2011, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $44 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 25% for the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 was a result of reduced carried interest revenue, the reversal of a significant provision for doubtful accounts related to a specific fund and larger equity earnings in the prior-year fourth quarter, partially offset by the EBITDA contribution from ING REIM.
Please turn to Slide 16. Slide 16 shows the amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. On November 10, 2011, we closed on a senior secured sterling-denominated term loan A1 facility in the amount of approximately $300 million due in May 2016 with favorable terms substantially similar to our existing term loan A facility.
We remain very comfortable with our balance debt maturity profile with no meaningful maturities until 2015. We're also pleased with our strong overall balance sheet position as it provides us the flexibility to capitalize on additional strategic growth opportunities and other corporate initiatives.
Please turn into Slide 17. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use, our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of 2011 was approximately $1.6 billion. This represents an increase from year end 2010, primarily due to term loan borrowings to finance the acquisition of ING REIM.
At year end 2011, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.3% compared to 5.5% at the end of the third quarter of 2011. The lower average interest rate was primarily driven by the senior secured sterling term loan A1 completed in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.53x at the end of 2011 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to EBITDA stood at 2.05x, which is significantly lower than the 2.5x we projected that this ratio would be following the acquisition of all of ING REIM.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

We believe that the commercial real estate market will continue to recover in 2012 despite continued macro challenges. As for our business, we expect to grow both earnings and normalized EBITDA margins even in this soft transaction environment.
Outsourcing of revenue is likely to grow in the low-double digits, one of the faster growth rates among our service lines. Investment sales will grow in line with a broader economic recovery with core assets still being the driver, but with increasing contribution from secondary market recoveries.
Leasing growth rates will likely be modest and heavily weighted toward the third and fourth quarters. Any revenue increase in this business would be driven by meaningful employment growth and rental rate improvement in the Americas and elsewhere.
EBITDA in investment management will be higher than 2011 due to the full year impact of the businesses acquired from ING, while development services EBITDA will be lower due to the large gains Gil mentioned we achieved in 2011. By taking advantage of the revenue growth drivers just mentioned and continuing our focus on effective cost controls, our goal is to again achieve 2012 normalized EBITDA margins greater than we achieved in 2011.
It is important to note that 2012 performance is likely to be more backend loaded than usual due to the slow transaction environment we have experienced in the heightened market uncertainty. Our outlook for 2012 assumes a pickup in job growth, economic activity and sentiment by the summer.
Giving due consideration to all of these factors as well as anticipated higher interest depreciation and amortization expense mainly as a result of the inclusion of ING REIM for a full year, we currently anticipate that full year 2012 normalized earnings per share will be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25. As we told you last year, forecasting EPS in an environment such as this is exceptionally difficult. We may very well update this guidance throughout the year as full year trends become clear.
With that, operator, we're ready for questions."

And that would take out what we've normalized essentially in the operating expense line. And in that line, I think we have $11 million of such costs. So whatever is on the P&L, you can take $11 million out for OpEx for cost containment.  And in addition, we have about $45 million of integration cost in that line associated with ING REIM.

It is no secret to you, these contracts come with significant upfront cost and they can be punishing to short term margins, although we price them and make absolutely certain as we price them that once those accounts stabilize, their run rate margins are very good. But you're going to see I think forever and going forward and you've seen it in 2011 that these are very expensive accounts that come in with real cost and for a quarter or 2 they can materially hurt margins a bit but if you have enough of them that are hitting run rate we can cover all that more with the terrific performance of the existing accounts.

Now that is where the renewals get exciting for us because once we prove ourselves with newer generation accounts, we are allowed to perform additional services to them and many times it's the additional services that bring in the great margins not the original services we were hired for.  I think, Anthony, we've gone over that with you and the other callers many times but facilities management many times is the lead.

It's in entities that are consolidated through investment management segment and so forth.  So there is about $800 million, a little bit over $800 million of which about $500 million is in the U.S., a big chunk goes out for bonuses. There will be some left over after that obviously and that would be held for now to assess opportunities in the market and given uncertainties in Europe and so forth.

I know you understand all this but we have some callers that are probably fairly new to the story. For folks to understand, first of all we're seasonal business and we tend to onboard cash heavily in the third and fourth quarters and very little in the first and second quarters. So we end up every year with a heavy cash balance, because of the seasonality. And also because we need to preserve a decent amount of cash to payout bonuses, we have 31,000 employees and many of those are bonusable and so, those numbers add up as Gil just mentioned.  Given where we are in the cycle, we see lots of opportunity out there to grow the business not just organically but through acquisitions and so having this cash on the balance sheet as opposed to using it for other things, to us, it's a wise move at the moment. And that's, as Gil mentioned, you're seeing that the combined dynamics of saving for bonuses plus opportunities in the market moving up that cash number a bit higher than we usually have it."

So first of all the pipeline information on outsourcing is very good for the next 60 days, because those are contracts that have been put out to the market for which we're competing presently. However the pipeline beyond that is almost nonexistent because the way in which these company's hire services. This is not a business -- it's very interesting actually, Sloan, this is not a business where you have the big marketing force out cold calling major corporations and trying to convince them to outsource. But the process to get a company to do that is long-lived. And by the way the momentum to do it is so strong at the moment that most of our work is simply responding to our fees that are coming in the door and making decisions around which RFPs we think are worth chasing and which we're just going to let go by the way side.  I would tell you that the short-term pipeline looks really good and all the trends, long-term trends that we would look at to support future growth in that business look very strong as well.  So said another way, it's purely subjective not objective. But I would tell you that if there were a 12-month or an 18-month pipeline, it would look very strong right now. And I get that by extrapolating the macros that we watch around that industry. We have a number of very significant contracts that we've won in the past 2 years. And we certainly expect those contracts at this point to either being bedded down or getting close to being bedded down.  But because this business is growing so fast right now and this is what I was trying to allude to earlier and probably not very well, because it's growing so fast right now. We've got a lot of business coming to the door right now, that's going to require some upfront cost. And I think that what the net of impact on all that is that because so much new business is coming in, the margins in that business might be a little bit soft until this rate of new business coming in plateaus and we have a chance to bed down these many, many clients, we've got coming in the door.  I don't remember the specific number, and Gil, what comes to memory is something like a 173 accounts of one form or another that came in, in 2011. But you get a sense for the velocity of this business and the way in which we have to approach those accounts and onboard cost for those accounts. And then manage them going forward. Gil, is that number relatively?"

We get there by not bidding on accounts that we think are priced too low. So that there is no way in a competitive market environment like this one and that business is super competitive. We don't have any pricing power, none. And we get into the bid process and we know what the margins we want. And the client for whatever reason is unwilling to pay those margins we drop out. And so I suppose the net effect of all that is it kind of feels like pricing power but it's more turning down accounts that are not profitable enough for us and only pursuing those that are. And I think, Sloan, and I've talked about this I think it's going to be a long, long time before in the outsourcing business any provider really has a pricing power to speak of.  I do believe that even right now in the first quarter of 2012, I do believe that all the service providers have done a much better job of educating these clients around the idea that it makes sense to pay reasonable pricing with a reasonable margin for these services, because what's happened to a number of these clients is they've gone and they've hired or their consultant, even worse, their consultants have gone out and hired a low margin, low cost bidder. Six months into the contract they call us up and ask them to help them out because that provider is failing miserably. They don't have the platform, they didn't price it right. We make sure and remind those clients that we're happy to do it, but there is a reason why we dropped out of the bid.  And that's happening less and less as those failures are more obvious and I think public and that is allowing the marketplace I think the price, the business after our fee process a bit better for us than they did in the past. This is just not a business that I think any smart corporation or owner for that matter would want to choose a low cost provider. It is far too strategic to what they do. And the risks to choosing the wrong provider are far too large. And that helps pricing as well."

And I think, as you well know and most of the callers are very well aware, we're in this very odd recovery. It's fits and starts, it's incremental. And it is so susceptible at the moment to sentiment either positive or negative, sentiment has outsized impacts on the market. So when we see a shock to this system which may actually not be material, it can freeze the credit market. And certainly you folks know this even better than I do. And when you see a single good jobs report like what came out last week, there's this euphoria that everything has gotten entirely better, neither are true.  And so because of that what the capital markets need is just a period of time of quiet, of no new big news. And I'm hopeful that 2012 may actually be the year where that happens and that what we get is a return to a more normal recovery expansion cycle, and we have not had one to date since the bottom of the downturn and that's what we need.  And when that happens you begin to see financing loosen up fairly quickly, you may recall and our callers may recall that by the spring of 2011, there was -- the sentiment was things were getting better quickly, the first quarter and most of the second quarter. And the secondary property markets began to see a lot of action in that kind of May, June timeframe. And then we got a shock again and everything shut down again, and all the money went back to core.  That kind of bunker mentality, anytime there is a body check, exists very much today, just as it did last year and the year before. And those secondary markets, I believe are not going to get real action and real traction until the recovery has a chance to operate in a normal fashion as without big negative shock."

And that was the entirety of the change quarter-over-quarter in the leasing revenues.  Rents were -- it was very little change in rents in the quarter. And there was very little change in square footage.  And by the way, what we're seeing in that marketplace, as you would expect with the type of economy we're dealing with right now is of all the business lines we have leasing in the U.S. is the one acting most abnormal to a typical recovery cycle. And the reason of course, and this is obvious, I know to you David, but everyone else, the reason for that is the job growth is so muted.  So in a typical recovery you have a combined impact of rental rate growth, which tends to move very quickly, up in recovery cycle and rapid job growth, which tends to move very quickly up. We don't have either of those right now, because of the type of very, very incremental recovery rent.  We believe both of those are coming. And I think as most of you know, in 2011, I believe the number was 56 million square feet of construction was brought to the market in the United States, which is the absolute lowest amount of new construction since the numbers were kept in 1960.  What it tells you is, you have a lot of people out there right now, who are not willing to build a new building and lenders unwilling to lend on one. But what it also tells us is, is that when the recovery gets its legs and we get real job growth, rents could move up very, very quickly, because the inventory number is artificially constrained right now.  But, David, the answer to your question was, it was purely velocity. And our comments on the scripted portion of the call, the way [ph] the leasing are, our expectation is, is that leasing is going to remain very muted until we see meaningful job growth. And our projections are based on a lot of different data points is that we think that's a Q3, Q4 event and that Q1 and Q2 on leasing will be relatively flat perhaps nominally up or nominally down, it's not going to move much.  The surprise, if we get one, will be up. I think the level of leasing we're seeing right now is pretty much dial tone. We're also now working off of compares that are quite strong, as you saw, the leasing number for 2011 was a record high. So we are at a high level. I don't see a lot of growth in that until we see real job growth. And we're hopeful we're going to see that second-half of the year."

The macro market trends that have prevailed for most of 2011 have generally continued in the first quarter of 2012. The market is recovering, but at an incremental and uneven pace. While no two recoveries are identical, this current one is marked by mixed performance across geographies and market sectors. 
That being said, our highly productive market-leading and diversified platform helped us deliver a strong opening quarter for 2012. We especially benefited from strong performance in the Americas, and in a moment Mike Lafitte, our president of the Americas, will describe our integrated Americas business platform in a bit more detail. 
Not unexpectedly, EMEA performance weakened versus the prior year first quarter, as transaction activity has slowed against tough economic conditions. In Asia Pacific, while there was overall revenue growth, investment sales in the region cooled a bit. We also saw material and immediate contributions from the addition of the ING Real Estate Investment Management people, programs and platform to our investment management business. We expect these positive contributions to continue as we complete our integration process. 
Our global outsourcing business continued to make strong gains, with revenue growing by double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. Both total contracts signed and new wins set records, and we surpassed the 3 billion square foot managed milestone. 
In our transaction businesses, leasing resumed growth with a 3% gain over the first quarter of 2011. Investment sales revenue increased 10%, and also deserving special mention is commercial mortgage brokerage, which jumped 46%. 
As a result of all this, we posted solid 14% revenue growth and even stronger, 25%, normalized EBITDA growth, during the quarter. And I am particularly pleased to report that our EBITDA margin expanded 90 BPs, to 11.1%. 
Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown on slide five. As is our practice, I will not go through them individually but we have included them here for your review. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Lafitte, our president of the Americas, to discuss his real strong performance in the Americas business. Mike?

As you have read in our earnings release and as Brett mentioned, our Americas business had excellent performance in the first quarter of 2012.

As you have read in our earnings release and as Brett mentioned, our Americas business had excellent performance in the first quarter of 2012. We are very pleased to achieve 13% revenue growth and 29% normalized EBITDA growth in a sluggish economic environment. Credit for this goes to our nearly 21,000 Americas employees, who are intensely focused on providing superior service to our clients and maintaining disciplined expense control. 
We took tough actions in 2011 to align our cost base to the difficult operating environment, and we are now seeing some benefits from those actions. 
In the Americas, we have built a very large, deep, diverse, highly-integrated and arguably unparalleled platform. It took many years and considerable investment to build this robust platform and to integrate its component parts so they worked together cohesively. We are focused on continuous improvement of our platform to stay ahead of our evolving client needs. 
Our financial business statistics for 2011 shown here were just published late last week. They underscore the magnitude of our platform. Even in a lukewarm market environment, we closed more than 38,000 sales and lease transactions in the Americas, valued at approximately $92 billion. You can see this activity was evenly split between sales and leasing. 
Our people specialize in each of the major product segments: office, industrial, retail and the multi-housing space. This specialization provides unique expertise and insight, which positions us very well to capture market opportunities. 
Our valuation platform is also robust. We maintain the largest market position in this space, serving financial institutions, corporations and special servicers, and there is great synergy with both our capital markets and our outsourcing business in the valuation space. 
Our commercial mortgage brokerage business involves loan origination and sales, which is growing well as liquidity returns to the investment markets. Americas’ loan origination volumes rose nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2012 versus a year earlier. We do significant work with government agencies. For 2011, the Mortgage Bankers Association ranked us number one originator of government agency loans. The volume of work with these agencies has continued to grow into 2012. 
Through our joint venture with GE Capital, GEMSA, we are also one of the industry’s largest loan servicers, with over $100 billion of loans being serviced today. 
In our 1.6 billion square foot Americas property and corporate facilities portfolio, we are achieving strong growth by focusing on winning trophy asset assignments from institutional loaners as well as occupiers. You saw an example on the previous slide, the 4.2 million square foot Houston center, which we are now managing for JP Morgan Investment Management. 
Project leasing is also a core offering in our outsourcing portfolio, and is highly synergistic with our leasing business. We managed over $13 billion in projects during 2011. Strong growth opportunities also exist for us throughout Latin America and our Canadian operations. They now account for 11% of the Americas revenue for the first quarter of 2012. 
Please turn to slide seven. These are new statistics published this month by National Real Estate Investor. You’ll see that our sales and lease transaction value in the Americas approaches or greatly exceeds the global activity for any other firm. We compete with many firms in different markets across the region. Many are focused on certain niches, such as tenant representation, or sales, or finance area. Few have the depth and breadth of our service platform, and none have achieved our scale or our market position. 
Please turn to slide eight. This slide illustrates how we put our powerful platform to work for our clients. In leasing, some of our largest 2012 closed transactions are depicted here. First, we represented Carter’s, an infant clothes retailer, in connection with a lease for a 1 million square foot distribution facility outside of Atlanta. Site selection was done with the assistance of our labor analytics group. You may know that we represented Condé Nast last year in its 1 million square foot lease at One World Trade Center in New York. Condé Nast continues to grow and has taken an additional 139,000 square feet in the building. Ceva Logistics and E*Trade are both broker-led outsourcing accounts. We have long-term contracts with them to perform transaction work across the region. Accounts like these generate approximately 15% of our Americas leasing revenue. In capital markets, Hess Tower is yet another example of a great platform story. This trophy office building in Houston was developed by the Trammell Crow Company along with principal real estate investors and sold recently for a record price. Seabury Service Platform played a key role in assisting the Trammell Crow Company in principal, first in managing the asset and serving as the agent in a lease to Hess, then in the sale to H&R REIT, a Canadian open-ended REIT. Our debt and equity finance team also arranged a $250 million loan for H&R to finance the purchase. The Mount Airy transaction noted here, which closed last week, is evidence of Seabury’s unique comprehensive capabilities. This is a $165 million recapitalization of a Poconos resort and casino. Our investment banking group, CBRE Capital Advisors, acted as exclusive financial advisor and co-arranger in a syndicated loan. The last example is representative of our growing impact in Latin America. We arranged a $100 million sale of a class A asset in the heart of Santiago’s business district. CBRE’s local team in Chile collaborated with our U.S. capital markets professionals in the sale of this tower on behalf of a German open-ended fund, a truly cross-border transaction. 
Please turn to slide nine. Outsourcing continues to be our single largest business line. Its 45% share of the Americas revenue in the first quarter is a little high due to seasonality, slower leasing and sales activity in the first quarter. For the full year in 2011, it accounted for 39% of the Americas revenue. The business continues to grow at a double digit pace. In asset services, we are focused on large, strategic accounts. Our goal is to deliver multiple synergistic services for those institutions and to be their preferred provider throughout the entire life cycle of their investment. There are currently about 30 strategic accounts in total. The five largest are listed here in alphabetical order. On the corporate services side, we are continuing to rapidly on-board new clients and expand our service offering with current clients. Of the record 58 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2012, more than 40 are in the Americas and others are global relationships, generally with significant Americas component. I’d like to comment on just a few of these. First, for Deloitte, we provide variable project management services for its space throughout the United States. We recently added and extended this nine-year relationship. Additionally, we won new facilities managements assignments with Microsoft and NYSE Euronext, demonstrating our ability to nurture and grow client relationships. Adventist Health Systems and the University of Cincinnati are emblematic of our increasing penetration of the healthcare and education markets. These sectors, as well as government, face enormous pressure to become more efficient, and we believe the opportunity is large as outsourcing adoption in this space is in its infancy. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Gil.

Total revenue was approximately $1.35 billion for the first quarter of 2012, up 14% from last year. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management, commercial mortgage brokerage and to a lesser degree, leasing. Normalized EBITDA grew at a stronger pace than revenue, up 25%, to $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, from $120.6 million in the first quarter of 2011, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 11.1% or an increase of 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2011. Our cost of services decreased to 58% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to 60.2% in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 operating expenses were 32.6% of total revenue, versus 31.8% in the first quarter of 2011. This offsetting impact on the cost of services and operating expenses resulted from the inclusion of ING REIM expenses, all of which flowed through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services. Interest expense increased by $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the ING REIM and Sterling Term Loan A-1 financings, which occurred after the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 42%. Consistent with prior years, this is seasonally higher than the anticipated full-year tax rate. We expect the full-year 2012 tax rate to be a little below 40%. First quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $.08 versus $.11 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $.14 versus $.13 in the first quarter of 2011. 
Please turn to slide 11. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the first quarter of 2012, representing 39% of total revenue in the quarter, with a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2011. Leasing was our second largest service line, representing 27% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2012, with increases in both Asia Pacific and the Americas. Investment sales showed a solid increase of 10% in the first quarter of 2012, driven by the Americas, and accounted for 13% of this quarter’s total revenue. Global investment management revenue more than doubled quarter over quarter, driven by increases in asset management and incentive fees, attributable to the ING REIM businesses. Appraisal and valuation revenue increased 6% to $79.7 million. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue jumped 46% year over year, driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads, and investors’ continued search for yield. Development services revenue was down approximately $3 million. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprises approximately 62% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2012. 
Slide 12 demonstrates stabilized vacancy rates and effective positive absorption in all three market sectors depicted, along with forecasted improvement over the next two years. The capital and investment sales volume data that we typically show is not yet available due to our slightly earlier reporting date this quarter. 
Please turn to slide 13. Sales revenue in the Americas increased 33% in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011, still driven by activities in core markets. Market share data for the first quarter of 2012 is not yet available, but we are pleased to note that late last week CBRE closed the largest single asset investment sale on the west coast since 2006, the $480 million sale of Russell Investment Center in Seattle. This transaction is indicative of the activity that appears to be surfacing in secondary markets. Our Americas leasing revenue increased modestly in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, in line with our expectations. During the first quarter of 2012, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained constant at 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The Americas outsourcing business grew a solid 11% in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011. 
Please turn to slide 14. Our EMEA investment sales revenue decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011. This weakness comes as no surprise, as economic challenges in the region persist, causing market-wide investment activity to decline 18%. CBRE’s EMEA leasing revenue decreased 6% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011. This weakness stems from caution around large space commitments, somewhat upset by stability and prime rent. It should be noted that France, which had an exceptional first quarter in 2011 in transaction activity, that tapered off as 2011 progressed, was largely responsible for the decrease in sales and leasing. Outsourcing slowed a bit, with revenue only increasing 6% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, driven by new assignment. EMEA decrease and normalized EBITDA resulted mainly from the reduction of the aforementioned higher-margin transaction revenues, the additional compensation expense associated with retention and severance, in part related to acquisitions, as well as slightly higher occupancy costs. 
Please turn to slide 15. CBRE’s sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased 34% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011, primarily driven by a cooling of activity across the region as decisions were delayed due to global economic uncertainty. CBRE’s leasing revenue in the Asia Pacific grew 8% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Some growth was evident in most markets, led by Australia and India. Asia Pacific saw outsourcing growth of 10% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011, as it continues to gain adoption in this region. Asia Pacific’s first quarter 2012 normalized EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by the aforementioned reduction in higher-margin investment sales revenue, investment in China and the favorable impact of a notable bonus accrual reversal in the first quarter of 2011 that did not recur this year. 
Please turn to slide 16. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2012, versus $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees and lower rental revenue, driven by property dispositions in the later quarters of 2011. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, in-process development totaled $4.8 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.3 billion. Our equity co-investments at the end of the first quarter of 2012 in the development services business totaled $93.6 million. 
Please turn to slide 17. First quarter 2012 global investment management revenue increased to $125.2 million, from $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from higher asset management and incentive fees, stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM, which contributed approximately $85 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Assets Under Management, or AUM, totaled $95.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2012, up about $1.8 billion from year-end 2011, primarily due to increases in valuation and benefits from currency fluctuations. In the first quarter of 2012, total AUM in the direct real estate business was impacted by $300 million of asset acquisitions, $1.1 billion of dispositions and transfers and $1.2 billion from improvement in asset values. 
In addition, currency fluctuations increased AUM by $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2012. Included in the $95.9 billion in AUM at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was $21.7 billion of listed securities. Changes in market valuation in this portfolio increased AUM by $1.9 billion in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, in the direct real estate business, we raised new capital of approximately $400 million and had approximately $2.8 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $176.9 million. 
Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on slide 18. In the first quarter of 2012, we incurred $10 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisitions, primarily for retention and severance. As of March 31, 2012, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $44 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 36% for the first quarter of 2012. If you recall, this is right within the range in which we anticipated we would operate at the time we announced the ING REIM acquisition. 
Slide 19 shows our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. This is virtually unchanged as compared to year-end 2011, and we remain very comfortable with this schedule and the flexibility it provides. 
Please turn to slide 20. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.9 billion. This represents an increase from year-end 2011, primarily due to incentive compensation payments, which are generally made in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.7%, similar to the end of 2011 when including interest rate swaps. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.81 times at the end of the first quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA stood at 2.29 times. I will now turn the call back over to Brett.

While the commercial real estate market recovery continues to be incremental and uneven, it is recovering nonetheless. Updates on our view for the year are that outsourcing is likely to continue strong growth. Recent growth rates across the globe will track job creation, and should continue to be modest for the time being. Investment sales growth is going to be dependent on specific regional market dynamics, noting that the economic climate in EMEA is challenged and there has been a recent cooling in Asia Pacific. 
And finally the investment management will benefit from a full-year contribution from the acquired ING Real Estate Investment Management businesses. With the first quarter now behind us, we are maintaining our view from year-end 2011. First, that our EPS guidance remains unchanged, and second, that we should see solid EBITDA margin expansion. 
And with that, Operator, we’d be happy to take questions.

It’s funny in the fourth quarter, we had a soft compare against one competitor on leasing numbers in a quarter.  And we spent some time talking about that and letting all of you know that this is a very big, very powerful, integrated business, and we focus on lots of things all the time. And any time we see a competitor for our competitive position at risk, or a competitor coming in and, as you said “nipping at our heels”, we redouble our efforts to correct that situation.  
Now, ironically or not, the bell of the ball this quarter is guess what?  Americas.  And by the way, that’s why we brought Michael Lafitte in, because that business is so much more than U.S. leasing. There’s no competitor even close to what we do in our U.S. integrated business, and that’s why we had Mike talk about it.
In terms of the competitive landscape on sales and leasing, you know this industry is, and we’ve been talking about this for so many years I can’t even remember when we started.  But this industry is rapidly consolidating down to two groups of players and we’ve got on the global landscape, I think we’ve got two big, high-quality, multinational integrated companies out there.  And we’ve got thousands of boutique firms out there that do whatever they do really, really well in single markets or single business lines.  And we’ve got these folks stuck in the middle, they’re going away so fast it’s almost hard to keep tract of it at this point.
By the way, we love that dynamic.  We love it because every day more and more of the accounts that we want to own, that we want to do business with, are turning to use for their services.
The competitive landscape on lease and sales in the U.S. and globally is really a tale of two stories, or two tales.
The first is, that in the U.S. the leasing landscape is a very, very competitive marketplace.  We are dominant in that marketplace and expect to remain so. However, the competitors that we had just three years ago, some of them are gone, and that share is going to be spread among other competitors in the business, and you should expect to see that going forward.
On the sale side, that marketplace is one we’ve dominated for many, many years and our competitive position in the sale space, if any, just gets better and better. 
So, we like where we sit.  As I said last quarter, we also like having a couple competitors nip a little bit at our heels, it makes us better, it gives us more focus. And as Mike talked about in his comments, it’s a good dynamic, and we welcome them to the party.

It sounds to me like the BCG, I think that’s right, it sounds like these players are sophisticated, they’re smart, they report to be well capitalized. I think that’s great.  And I think that this elimination of this middle group of firms, it’s just inevitable, it’s absolutely - it’s going to get done. We’re watching it get done. And the way that that’s going to happen is, there’s only a few choices.  They either go bankrupt and just disappear off the face of the earth, but these businesses have people in them. And so, if a good well-heeled company like BCG or another can come in and pick up the pieces of these failed firms, I think that’s great.  I know a lot of people inside those businesses, particularly Grub and Ellis, these are high-quality good people and the fact that they’ve found a home with an owner that’s excited about the industry, I think is a plus for everybody.  
I don’t think being owned by one type of owner or another is necessarily an advantage or a disadvantage. It all comes down to leadership, it all comes down to the people, and it all comes down to platform.  There’s a very, very long wave that any of these aggregators need the distance to go to, to get to the level where I think these couple big multinational firms are, is a huge distance.  But you know what?  Having folks that want to be there, having folks that are aspirational, having folks that are putting capital into this industry is a net benefit for everybody, they make us all better, and we welcome them to the dance.  It’s all good.
And by the way, it’s way better, that these firms that have gone through these horrible problems that they’ve had, again it’s way better that the good things inside those firms, which is the people, have found a place to land and do business and stay in the business in the marketplace.  That benefits all of us.

We get to capitalize those up front and then we have to amortize them over the service period.  So one is from the mortgage brokerage business servicing rights, one part of it is.  The other part of is the intangibles that we acquired in the ING acquisition for which we cannot normalize.  So we are - we have on a normalized basis about a $7 million increase year-over-year, and then on a GAAP basis it’s the 23 million and of that 16 million, about 10 of it is the result of incentive fees that we received during the quarter in the ING REIM business, so the normalization will go down as the year progresses.

And maybe this is what you were alluding to.  We did call out $32 million of development gains in the fourth quarter as being out sized, but that business has gains every year, and the guidance that we have this year would incorporate the gains that we think would be reoccurring.  So we had an outsided number, you know, in the 50 millions, but it’s not going to be that this year, and we said that on the last call, but there will be some runway of gains - that’s what that business does and that’s incorporated in the guidance.  
So it would only - the only things that would really stand out, and you really have to go back and analyze it quarter by quarter, I can’t do that on the call here, we could one-on-one if you need to, but is when the gains hit and when carried into it hits into the good and to the bad, those are the biggest things that would be [inaudible] to a quarter.

The first is our customers, you know, just landing new customers - we’re very active on that, both for on our investor side of our business as well as our occupiers.  We’re deep in mid-cash, we’re deep in healthcare, so, we’re very focused on landing new customers, and we’re doing that a lot.  
The second I would say is productivity advances that we’re focused on around our leasing professionals; training, specialty practice groups that are raising up in very specific niches, they are really take us into new areas, they can actually expand our own business.  
Certainly strategic hiring is part of it, and we’ve continued to remain very active on the hiring front through all of the down turn, we are always in the marketplace for great talent.  Through ’08, and ’09, and ’10, and ’11, we were adding and retracting great talent to our company at the mid and the higher levels for the most parts - always with a program to grow our own.  
And then, lastly, is improving fundamentals that I think will - that are ahead of us in some of those metrics that you asked about, and now Gil and Brett, you may want to comment on those metrics that we do track.  But then the fundamentals are improving and that is, I think, good news ahead, although it’s slower growth on the leasing side of what we are seeing certainly on the sales side.

And David, just on the numbers, let me fill in some numbers that Mike was referencing.  
First, on the fundamentals, as you saw from the deck, what we’re seeing in marketplaces, not surprising at all - we’re in, again, I think, early innings of a protract to a recovery, all though it’s uneven and incremental.  So they can see rates are very slowly coming down.  We’re seeing absorption, positive absorption bounce around, but it is positive.  And we’re seeing CAP rates on slowly coming down as well.  All of that, of course, is what Mike is referring to, and it augers towards an improving recovery as we look forward.  
On the actual sale and lease numbers for the U.S., I’ll give you a few numbers.  On the sale side, what we had was a fairly strong pick up in number of transactions first quarter 2011, or first quarter ’12, and in the U.S., for instance, that was 11% higher.  On the average transaction side, and again this is just U.S., it’s not Americas, what we saw there was a 25% increase in transaction size, and these together produce a 37% increase in reported sales revenue first-quarter-over-first-quarter, year-over-year.  Now, I want you to be careful, these numbers bounce around, because we are the early stages of recovery, but that’s what sales was for the first quarter.  
On the leasing side, it was generally flat year-over-year, and we look at office leasing and where the real pick up was, was actually in retail and industrial.  And those together gave us, in the U.S. at least, a 5% increase in reported leasing revenue year-over-year.  
Again, these numbers bounce around because that’s where we are at this point in the cycle, but as Mike said, and as we’ve mentioned in our deck here, the leasing business is all about job growth, and job growth has been true net job growth has not been anything to write home about for a while.  When that picks up and it will, leasing numbers will pick up along with it, and sometimes they pick up in an outsized way when you see real job growth.  The sale side actually is chugging along in the U.S. pretty well, and we talk about the slowness in Europe and Asia.

And I - the point that I’m trying to make, and not very well, is that in Europe you do have a couple of banks that are out - more than a couple that are out of the commercial real estate lending market.  There’s lots of capital flowing around the world that can support the purchase of high quality, investment grade, commercial real estate.  Now that having been said, you know, the real issue at the moment in Europe is just uncertainty, and it’s - you know, whenever we talk about this, we talk about it in 2008, 2009, 2010, and last year.  When you have uncertainty in a market place it makes it hard to find pricing, and - so, when there’s uncertainty in the market place, people just slow down and they take their time and they do a lot more work to make sure that they have got a view on pricing, and right now in Europe, I think the story is more about uncertainty in the market place which slows down transaction volume, if it is a lack of financing to buy an asset.  If you and I want to go out to London, or to Paris, or to Amsterdam, or for that matter New York, or Huston, or L.A., and buy a high quality asset, we’ll get the financing to do it.  It’s - that’s not really the major driver of the slowing that we’re seeing - it’s a piece of it.

It’s one that we talked about at the Q4 2011 call.  And we’re in an interesting environment in that we’re winning so much business right now that it’s actually hurting the margin a bit because these are big, big accounts and they come in, you know, depending on the account, they could turn run rate margin level and profitable six months in, but more likely, it might be a year in or even a bit more.  
So it’s an interesting - it’s a high-class problem to have that we’re winning so much new business that this now is impactful in a negative way on the margins.  And as I said on the fourth quarter call, if you just kind of do the math in your head, if you want the margins to move up nicely, you actually stop winning new business and then you’d get there in 8 to 12 months.  We’re not going to stop winning new business.  But I do think that this pace of winning, it’s unprecedented.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  
And I think that that will normalize and become a steadier process for us in the last couple of years.  But the margins will get back to a number that I think is more typical for us; part of it will be these accounts, these big, big accounts we’re getting, seasoning in, part will be just a change in marketplace.  
Again, we’ve got an expert on the phone that might want to speak with us.  Mike, you understand the question well, and this is the issue of we bring in these huge accounts, we don’t necessarily lose money on them in the early days, but we certainly aren’t making a lot of money.  And the question, I think, the analyst-investors are trying to get their head around is, you know, how does that play out in the midterm?  And the answer you heard what we’re saying.  Any opinions on this, Mike?

I just want to stress it for our callers, which is the way in which we account within our P&L the various revenues that flow off of various business can be a little tricky.  And so when you look at a single line and you look at the outsourcing business, for instance, and you all know this on the phone call.  It is not the entire picture.  Lots of the higher margin revenues that flow off these accounts aren’t captured in that segment.  They’re captured in leasing, they’re captured in - as Mike just said, they’re captured in sales, they’re captured in valuation.  And so just to paraphrase or say a different way from what Mike said, when we tell you that in 2012, in a very tricky global economic environment, that our margins will see solid growth, part of the story there is higher margin work flowing from these corporate accounts, even though the corporate account segment you’re looking at, but it looked like the margins went down a bit because these businesses came in, transient costs, et cetera.  
So I think Mike makes a very good point.  The big picture story here is that this business, the other businesses we have all play a role in a firm that’s been able to grow margins quarter, over quarter, over quarter in up cycles and we intend to continue that going forward.  
And by the way, you know, if having growth like this in the outsourcing business is one of the things we take massive pride in.  These are the absolute best in class world corporations who are trusting with us the facilities they work in.  This is great, great stuff we’re seeing here.

I can’t help myself.  But here’s what I would say.  Again, I want to go back to the same thing, which is we’re in the early quarters of what I think is going to be a very exciting attractive recovery in the asset class.  And this is a particularly rocky, uneven recovery.  So - and you know this as well as anyone on the phone call, where we saw recovery start was in the safest places, whether it was leasing or sales, what we saw when the recover was people begin to make investments whether they’re owners or occupiers in those places they thought were bulletproof.  If they’re buying an asset, it was made in Manhattan, you’re going to open a data center or you were going to expand a corporate office, you were doing it in the places where you felt most certain about your business.  
As this recovery seasons, that recovery, and Gil referenced this earlier, that recovery begins to move a bit up the risk spectrum.  And so what you see is, you see assets and you’ve probably seen this personally, you’ve seen assets begin to trade in areas outside of Main and Main in Manhattan.  You see corporate, whether it’s retailer or industrial logistics firms, or big office clients, they begin to do things in markets outside of the major world financial centers.  It’s absolutely typical for an early-stage recovery and what we said a couple quarters ago, I just want to remind you again is, let’s look forward a year from now, or whether it’s three quarters or five quarters or whatever it’s going to be, this - the strength you see in the major markets in both leasing and sales will have spread out to the secondary and even some of the tertiary markets.  That’s just a cycle this business goes through and will go through for a very long time, I think.

And what you saw in the results was that we saw in Europe and Asia accruing of the investment property markets.  So definitionally what - let me translate that for you.  What you saw was hesitancy in closings.  What you saw was protracted closings.  What you saw was canceled closings.  When you see an investment - capital market cool down, that’s what’s going on.  On the leasing side, it’s a little bit different.  On the leasing side, generally speaking, when occupiers launch a property search and they get into a negotiation to lease 20,000 square feet of retail or 100,000 square feet of office, they don’t generally collapse negotiations and walk away.  It’s a little more - I guess it’s a little more sticky and that’s why, by the way, the leafing - if you look over the last 20 years, just look at the deltas in leasing revenues, they are much, much less volatile than what you see in the capital markets and it’s a lot about that.  I think anecdotally, what I would say to you is that for the last eight quarters, what we’ve seen is [inaudible] and starts.  And you and I have talked about it, it’s, you know, you get some traction going in the spring of 2011 and people feel that things are a lot better and then there’s a shock to the system, the euro sovereign debt issue.  And the suddenly the brakes are put on again.  And then you get some traction again and then there’s China housing bubble issue.  
I think that we’re going to continue to see these kinds of things through the business until this recovery really gets it’s sea legs and it’s not there.  It’s getting incrementally better every quarter.  The fundamentals that Mike Lafitte referenced are getting better every quarter.  But it’s going to be a bumpy ride I think for a bit.  
But again, I want to put that in context.  You know, if I’m describing a bumpy ride and revenues are up 14% for the quarter and EBITDA is up 25% for the quarter and we’re reaffirming guidance, we’re telling you our margins are going to expand, I’ll take that bumpy ride all day long.

I’ll just add to this that at - in a market environment like we’re in, M&A is something that, first of all, it’s dial tone for us.  So we’re always looking at what’s out there and available.  You’re just going to see probably a little bit less of it in a marketplace like this.  If Gil said, you know, de-levering is certainly at the top of our list, there’s a lot of movement in the market right now in terms of very small M&A, but not much is very attractive.  And we have our priorities at the moment that are not really built around doing 100 M&A deals this year.  We’ve got this world class platform now, top business line in every business line we’re in and really leveraging the synergies of this business lines and growing our business now with this great platform, it’s a very, very exciting proposition.  
If an opportunity arises out in the marketplace, as we’ve always said before, you know, in a good market or bad, and this I would describe as a pretty good market, we’re going to look at it.  But the high-quality opportunities are few and far between at the moment.

The macro market trends that have prevailed for most of 2011 have generally continued in the first quarter of 2012. The market is recovering, but at an incremental and uneven pace. While no 2 recoveries are identical, this current one is marked by mixed performance across geographies and market sectors.
That being said, our highly productive market-leading and diversified platform helped us deliver a strong opening quarter for 2012. We especially benefited from strong performance in the Americas, and in a moment Mike Lafitte, our president of the Americas, will describe our integrated Americas business platform in a bit more detail.
Not unexpectedly, EMEA performance weakened versus the prior year first quarter, as transaction activity has slowed against tough economic conditions. In Asia Pacific, while there was overall revenue growth, investment sales in the region cooled a bit. We also saw material and immediate contributions from the addition of the ING Real Estate Investment Management people, programs and platform to our investment management business. We expect these positive contributions to continue as we complete our integration process.
Our global outsourcing business continued to make strong gains, with revenue growing by double digits for the 6th consecutive quarter. Both total contracts signed and new wins set records, and we surpassed the 3 billion square foot managed milestone.
In our transaction businesses, leasing resumed growth with a 3% gain over the first quarter of 2011. Investment sales revenue increased 10%, and also deserving special mention is commercial mortgage brokerage, which jumped 46%.
As a result of all this, we posted solid 14% revenue growth and even stronger, 25%, normalized EBITDA growth, during the quarter. And I am particularly pleased to report that our EBITDA margin expanded 90 bps, to 11.1%.
Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown on Slide 5. As is our practice, I will not go through them individually but we have included them here for your review. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Lafitte, our president of the Americas, to discuss his real strong performance in the Americas business. Mike?"

As you have read in our earnings release and as Brett mentioned, our Americas business had excellent performance in the first quarter of 2012. We are very pleased to achieve 13% revenue growth and 29% normalized EBITDA growth in a sluggish economic environment. Credit for this goes to our nearly 21,000 Americas employees, who are intensely focused on providing superior service to our clients and maintaining disciplined expense control.
We took tough actions in 2011 to align our cost base to the difficult operating environment, and we are now seeing some benefits from those actions.
In the Americas, we have built a very large, deep, diverse, highly-integrated and arguably unparalleled platform. It took many years and considerable investment to build this robust platform and to integrate its component parts so they worked together cohesively. We are focused on continuous improvement of our platform to stay ahead of our evolving client needs.
Our financial business statistics for 2011 shown here were just published late last week. They underscore the magnitude of our platform. Even in a lukewarm market environment, we closed more than 38,000 sales and lease transactions in the Americas, valued at approximately $92 billion. You can see this activity was evenly split between sales and leasing.
Our people specialize in each of the major product segments: office, industrial, retail and the multi-housing space. This specialization provides unique expertise and insight, which positions us very well to capture market opportunities.
Our valuation platform is also robust. We maintain the largest market position in this space, serving financial institutions, corporations and special servicers, and there is great synergy with both our capital markets and our outsourcing business in the valuation space.
Our commercial mortgage brokerage business involves loan origination and sales, which is growing well as liquidity returns to the investment markets. Americas’ loan origination volumes rose nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2012 versus a year earlier. We do significant work with government agencies. For 2011, the Mortgage Bankers Association ranked us number one originator of government agency loans. The volume of work with these agencies has continued to grow into 2012.
Through our joint venture with GE Capital, GEMSA, we are also one of the industry’s largest loan servicers, with over $100 billion of loans being serviced today.
In our 1.6 billion square foot Americas property and corporate facilities portfolio, we are achieving strong growth by focusing on winning trophy asset assignments from institutional loaners as well as occupiers. You saw an example on the previous Slide, the 4.2 million square foot Houston center, which we are now managing for JP Morgan Investment Management.
Project leasing is also a core offering in our outsourcing portfolio, and is highly synergistic with our leasing business. We managed over $13 billion in projects during 2011. Strong growth opportunities also exist for us throughout Latin America and our Canadian operations. They now account for 11% of the Americas revenue for the first quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 7. These are new statistics published this month by National Real Estate Investor. You’ll see that our sales and lease transaction value in the Americas approaches or greatly exceeds the global activity for any other firm. We compete with many firms in different markets across the region. Many are focused on certain niches, such as tenant representation, or sales, or finance area. Few have the depth and breadth of our service platform, and none have achieved our scale or our market position.
Please turn to Slide 8. This slide illustrates how we put our powerful platform to work for our clients. In leasing, some of our largest 2012 closed transactions are depicted here. First, we represented Carter’s, an infant clothes retailer, in connection with a lease for a 1 million square foot distribution facility outside of Atlanta. Site selection was done with the assistance of our labor analytics group. You may know that we represented Condé Nast last year in its 1 million square foot lease at One World Trade Center in New York. Condé Nast continues to grow and has taken an additional 139,000 square feet in the building. Ceva Logistics and E*Trade are both broker-led outsourcing accounts. We have long-term contracts with them to perform transaction work across the region. Accounts like these generate approximately 15% of our Americas leasing revenue. In capital markets, Hess Tower is yet another example of a great platform story. This trophy office building in Houston was developed by the Trammell Crow Company along with principal real estate investors and sold recently for a record price. Seabury Service Platform played a key role in assisting the Trammell Crow Company in principal, first in managing the asset and serving as the agent in a lease to Hess, then in the sale to H&R REIT, a Canadian open-ended REIT. Our debt and equity finance team also arranged a $250 million loan for H&R to finance the purchase. The Mount Airy transaction noted here, which closed last week, is evidence of Seabury’s unique comprehensive capabilities. This is a $165 million recapitalization of a Poconos resort and casino. Our investment banking group, CBRE Capital Advisors, acted as exclusive financial advisor and co-arranger in a syndicated loan. The last example is representative of our growing impact in Latin America. We arranged a $100 million sale of a class A asset in the heart of Santiago’s business district. CBRE’s local team in Chile collaborated with our U.S. capital markets professionals in the sale of this tower on behalf of a German open-ended fund, a truly cross-border transaction.
Please turn to Slide 9. Outsourcing continues to be our single largest business line. Its 45% share of the Americas revenue in the first quarter is a little high due to seasonality, slower leasing and sales activity in the first quarter. For the full year in 2011, it accounted for 39% of the Americas revenue. The business continues to grow at a double digit pace. In asset services, we are focused on large, strategic accounts. Our goal is to deliver multiple synergistic services for those institutions and to be their preferred provider throughout the entire life cycle of their investment. There are currently about 30 strategic accounts in total. The 5 largest are listed here in alphabetical order. On the corporate services side, we are continuing to rapidly on-board new clients and expand our service offering with current clients. Of the record 58 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2012, more than 40 are in the Americas and others are global relationships, generally with significant Americas component. I’d like to comment on just a few of these. First, for Deloitte, we provide variable project management services for its space throughout the United States. We recently added and extended this nine-year relationship. Additionally, we won new facilities managements assignments with Microsoft and NYSE Euronext, demonstrating our ability to nurture and grow client relationships. Adventist Health Systems and the University of Cincinnati are emblematic of our increasing penetration of the healthcare and education markets. These sectors, as well as government, face enormous pressure to become more efficient, and we believe the opportunity is large as outsourcing adoption in this space is in its infancy. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Gil."

Total revenue was approximately $1.35 billion for the first quarter of 2012, up 14% from last year. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management, commercial mortgage brokerage and to a lesser degree, leasing. Normalized EBITDA grew at a stronger pace than revenue, up 25%, to $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, from $120.6 million in the first quarter of 2011, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 11.1% or an increase of 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2011. Our cost of services decreased to 58% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to 60.2% in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 operating expenses were 32.6% of total revenue, versus 31.8% in the first quarter of 2011. This offsetting impact on the cost of services and operating expenses resulted from the inclusion of ING REIM expenses, all of which flowed through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services. Interest expense increased by $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the ING REIM and Sterling Term Loan A-1 financings, which occurred after the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 42%. Consistent with prior years, this is seasonally higher than the anticipated full-year tax rate. We expect the full-year 2012 tax rate to be a little below 40%. First quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $.08 versus $.11 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $.14 versus $.13 in the first quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 11. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the first quarter of 2012, representing 39% of total revenue in the quarter, with a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2011. Leasing was our second largest service line, representing 27% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2012, with increases in both Asia Pacific and the Americas. Investment sales showed a solid increase of 10% in the first quarter of 2012, driven by the Americas, and accounted for 13% of this quarter’s total revenue. Global investment management revenue more than doubled quarter over quarter, driven by increases in asset management and incentive fees, attributable to the ING REIM businesses. Appraisal and valuation revenue increased 6% to $79.7 million. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue jumped 46% year over year, driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads, and investors’ continued search for yield. Development services revenue was down approximately $3 million. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprises approximately 62% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2012.
Slide 12 demonstrates stabilized vacancy rates and effective positive absorption in all 3 market sectors depicted, along with forecasted improvement over the next 2 years. The capital and investment sales volume data that we typically show is not yet available due to our slightly earlier reporting date this quarter.
Please turn to Slide 13. Sales revenue in the Americas increased 33% in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011, still driven by activities in core markets. Market share data for the first quarter of 2012 is not yet available, but we are pleased to note that late last week CBRE closed the largest single asset investment sale on the west coast since 2006, the $480 million sale of Russell Investment Center in Seattle. This transaction is indicative of the activity that appears to be surfacing in secondary markets. Our Americas leasing revenue increased modestly in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, in line with our expectations. During the first quarter of 2012, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained constant at 16% compared to the 4th quarter of 2011. The Americas outsourcing business grew a solid 11% in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 14. Our EMEA investment sales revenue decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011. This weakness comes as no surprise, as economic challenges in the region persist, causing market-wide investment activity to decline 18%. CBRE’s EMEA leasing revenue decreased 6% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011. This weakness stems from caution around large space commitments, somewhat upset by stability and prime rent. It should be noted that France, which had an exceptional first quarter in 2011 in transaction activity, that tapered off as 2011 progressed, was largely responsible for the decrease in sales and leasing. Outsourcing slowed a bit, with revenue only increasing 6% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, driven by new assignment. EMEA decrease and normalized EBITDA resulted mainly from the reduction of the aforementioned higher-margin transaction revenues, the additional compensation expense associated with retention and severance, in part related to acquisitions, as well as slightly higher occupancy costs.
Please turn to Slide 15. CBRE’s sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased 34% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011, primarily driven by a cooling of activity across the region as decisions were delayed due to global economic uncertainty. CBRE’s leasing revenue in the Asia Pacific grew 8% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Some growth was evident in most markets, led by Australia and India. Asia Pacific saw outsourcing growth of 10% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011, as it continues to gain adoption in this region. Asia Pacific’s first quarter 2012 normalized EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by the aforementioned reduction in higher-margin investment sales revenue, investment in China and the favorable impact of a notable bonus accrual reversal in the first quarter of 2011 that did not recur this year.
Please turn to Slide 16. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2012, versus $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees and lower rental revenue, driven by property dispositions in the later quarters of 2011. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, in-process development totaled $4.8 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.3 billion. Our equity co-investments at the end of the first quarter of 2012 in the development services business totaled $93.6 million.
Please turn to Slide 17. First quarter 2012 global investment management revenue increased to $125.2 million, from $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from higher asset management and incentive fees, stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM, which contributed approximately $85 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Assets Under Management, or AUM, totaled $95.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2012, up about $1.8 billion from year-end 2011, primarily due to increases in valuation and benefits from currency fluctuations. In the first quarter of 2012, total AUM in the direct real estate business was impacted by $300 million of asset acquisitions, $1.1 billion of dispositions and transfers and $1.2 billion from improvement in asset values.
In addition, currency fluctuations increased AUM by $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2012. Included in the $95.9 billion in AUM at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was $21.7 billion of listed securities. Changes in market valuation in this portfolio increased AUM by $1.9 billion in the quarter versus the 4th quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, in the direct real estate business, we raised new capital of approximately $400 million and had approximately $2.8 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $176.9 million.
Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 18. In the first quarter of 2012, we incurred $10 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisitions, primarily for retention and severance. As of March 31, 2012, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $44 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 36% for the first quarter of 2012. If you recall, this is right within the range in which we anticipated we would operate at the time we announced the ING REIM acquisition.
Slide 19 shows our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. This is virtually unchanged as compared to year-end 2011, and we remain very comfortable with this schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to Slide 20. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.9 billion. This represents an increase from year-end 2011, primarily due to incentive compensation payments, which are generally made in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.7%, similar to the end of 2011 when including interest rate swaps. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.81 times at the end of the first quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA stood at 2.29 times. I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

It’s funny in the 4th quarter, we had a soft compare against one competitor on leasing numbers in a quarter.  And we spent some time talking about that and letting all of you know that this is a very big, very powerful, integrated business, and we focus on lots of things all the time. And any time we see a competitor or our competitive position at risk, or a competitor coming in and, as you said “nipping at our heels”, we redouble our efforts to correct that situation. Now, ironically or not, the belle of the ball this quarter is guess what?  Americas.  And by the way, that’s why we brought Michael Lafitte in, because that business is so much more than U.S. leasing. There’s no competitor even close to what we do in our U.S. integrated business, and that’s why we had Mike talk about it. In terms of the competitive landscape on sales and leasing, you know this industry is, and we’ve been talking about this for so many years I can’t even remember when we started.  But this industry is rapidly consolidating down to 2 groups of players and we’ve got on the global landscape, I think we’ve got 2 big, high-quality, multinational integrated companies out there.  And we’ve got thousands of boutique firms out there that do whatever they do really, really well in single markets or single business lines.  And we’ve got these folks stuck in the middle, they’re going away so fast it’s almost hard to keep track of it at this point. By the way, we love that dynamic.  We love it because every day more and more of the accounts that we want to own, that we want to do business with, are turning to use for their services.
The competitive landscape on lease and sales in the U.S. and globally is really a tale of 2 stories, or 2 tales. The first is, that in the U.S. the leasing landscape is a very, very competitive marketplace.  We are dominant in that marketplace and expect to remain so. However, the competitors that we had just 3 years ago, some of them are gone, and that share is going to be spread among other competitors in the business, and you should expect to see that going forward. On the sale side, that marketplace is one we’ve dominated for many, many years and our competitive position in the sale space, if any, just gets better and better. So, we like where we sit.  As I said last quarter, we also like having a couple competitors nip a little bit at our heels, it makes us better, it gives us more focus. And as Mike talked about in his comments, it’s a good dynamic, and we welcome them to the party."

And I think that this elimination of this middle group of firms, it’s just inevitable, it’s absolutely -- it’s going to get done. We’re watching it get done. And the way that that’s going to happen is, there’s only a few choices.  They either go bankrupt and just disappear off the face of the earth, but these businesses have people in them. And so, if a good well-heeled company like BCG or another can come in and pick up the pieces of these failed firms, I think that’s great.  I know a lot of people inside those businesses, particularly Grub and Ellis, these are high-quality good people and the fact that they’ve found a home with an owner that’s excited about the industry, I think is a plus for everybody. I don’t think being owned by one type of owner or another is necessarily an advantage or a disadvantage. It all comes down to leadership, it all comes down to the people, and it all comes down to platform.  There’s a very, very long wave that any of these aggregators need the distance to go to, to get to the level where I think these couple big multinational firms are, is a huge distance.  But you know what?  Having folks that want to be there, having folks that are aspirational, having folks that are putting capital into this industry is a net benefit for everybody, they make us all better, and we welcome them to the dance.  It’s all good. And by the way, it’s way better, that these firms that have gone through these horrible problems that they’ve had, again it’s way better that the good things inside those firms, which is the people, have found a place to land and do business and stay in the business in the marketplace.

So vacancy rates are very slowly coming down.  We’re seeing absorption, positive absorption bounce around, but it is positive.  And we’re seeing CAP rates on slowly coming down as well.  All of that, of course, is what Mike is referring to, and it augers towards an improving recovery as we look forward. On the actual sale and lease numbers for the U.S., I’ll give you a few numbers.  On the sale side, what we had was a fairly strong pick up in number of transactions first quarter 2011, or first quarter ’12, and in the U.S., for instance, that was 11% higher.  On the average transaction side, and again this is just U.S., it’s not Americas, what we saw there was a 25% increase in transaction size, and these together produce a 37% increase in reported sales revenue first-quarter-over-first-quarter, year-over-year.  Now, I want you to be careful, these numbers bounce around, because we are the early stages of recovery, but that’s what sales was for the first quarter. On the leasing side, it was generally flat year-over-year, and we look at office leasing and where the real pick up was, was actually in retail and industrial.  And those together gave us, in the U.S. at least, a 5% increase in reported leasing revenue year-over-year. Again, these numbers bounce around because that’s where we are at this point in the cycle, but as Mike said, and as we’ve mentioned in our deck here, the leasing business is all about job growth, and job growth has been true net job growth has not been anything to write home about for a while.  When that picks up and it will, leasing numbers will pick up along with it, and sometimes they pick up in an outsized way when you see real job growth.  The sale side actually is chugging along in the U.S. pretty well, and we talk about the slowness in Europe and Asia."

And I -- the point that I’m trying to make, and not very well, is that in Europe you do have a couple of banks that are out -- more than a couple that are out of the commercial real estate lending market.  There’s lots of capital flowing around the world that can support the purchase of high quality, investment grade, commercial real estate.  Now that having been said, you know, the real issue at the moment in Europe is just uncertainty, and it’s -- you know, whenever we talk about this, we talk about it in 2008, 2009, 2010, and last year.  When you have uncertainty in a market place it makes it hard to find pricing, and -- so, when there’s uncertainty in the market place, people just slow down and they take their time and they do a lot more work to make sure that they have got a view on pricing, and right now in Europe, I think the story is more about uncertainty in the market place which slows down transaction volume, if it is a lack of financing to buy an asset.  If you and I want to go out to London, or to Paris, or to Amsterdam, or for that matter New York, or Huston, or L.A., and buy a high quality asset, we’ll get the financing to do it.  It’s -- that’s not really the major driver of the slowing that we’re seeing -- it’s a piece of it."

It’s one that we talked about at the Q4 2011 call.  And we’re in an interesting environment in that we’re winning so much business right now that it’s actually hurting the margin a bit because these are big, big accounts and they come in, you know, depending on the account, they could turn run rate margin level and profitable 6 months in, but more likely, it might be a year in or even a bit more. So it’s an interesting -- it’s a high-class problem to have that we’re winning so much new business that this now is impactful in a negative way on the margins.  And as I said on the 4th quarter call, if you just kind of do the math in your head, if you want the margins to move up nicely, you actually stop winning new business and then you’d get there in 8 to 12 months.  We’re not going to stop winning new business.  But I do think that this pace of winning, it’s unprecedented.  I’ve never seen anything like it. And I think that that will normalize and become a steadier process for us in the last couple of years.  But the margins will get back to a number that I think is more typical for us; part of it will be these accounts, these big, big accounts we’re getting, seasoning in, part will be just a change in marketplace. Again, we’ve got an expert on the phone that might want to speak with us.  Mike, you understand the question well, and this is the issue of we bring in these huge accounts, we don’t necessarily lose money on them in the early days, but we certainly aren’t making a lot of money.  And the question, I think, the analyst-investors are trying to get their head around is, you know, how does that play out in the midterm?  And the answer you heard what we’re saying. Any opinions on this, Mike?"

So when you consider the margins of the entire business and you think about our higher margin business lines, certainly investment management, certainly capital markets when it is stabilized and going into markets like we’re in today, which we’re still operating at 60 to 70% of where we were in peak of ’07.  I would submit to you that the overall margins of the business, given the diversification of the entire pie really don’t dilute. Yes, on the front end, there’s transition costs on these GSC accounts, but we’ve been able to manage that year after year into the business, we plan for it.  It’s the investments that then also fuel the growth of our business.  So we are investing back into our platform in a big way; in people and in technology and all those things.  I would submit to you that our corporate services professionals would say yes, the more GCS business we’re going to add in overall relative to all of our lines of business may not be the highest margin business, but I would submit that they’re all still -- you know, have nice trajectories -- trajectory of growth.  And our margins are pretty consistent year over year in that business.  It’s not a loss leader by any stretch.  We’re in that business to make money and find new ways to serve our clients in the higher-end margin pieces too.  So if we land an FM account, it’s not unusual to find ourselves in a consulting role, doing capital markets transactions, doing sale leaseback transactions and adding on other services that can bolt onto those relationships. So often times they are the gateway to just tremendous activity down the road with very, very long, 15-20 year, relationships."

I just want to stress it for our callers, which is the way in which we account within our P&L the various revenues that flow off of various business can be a little tricky.  And so when you look at a single line and you look at the outsourcing business, for instance, and you all know this on the phone call.  It is not the entire picture.  Lots of the higher margin revenues that flow off these accounts aren’t captured in that segment.  They’re captured in leasing, they’re captured in -- as Mike just said, they’re captured in sales, they’re captured in valuation.  And so just to paraphrase or say a different way from what Mike said, when we tell you that in 2012, in a very tricky global economic environment, that our margins will see solid growth, part of the story there is higher margin work flowing from these corporate accounts, even though the corporate account segment you’re looking at, but it looked like the margins went down a bit because these businesses came in, transition costs, et cetera. So I think Mike makes a very good point.  The big picture story here is that this business, the other businesses we have all play a role in a firm that’s been able to grow margins quarter, over quarter, over quarter in up cycles and we intend to continue that going forward. And by the way, you know, if having growth like this in the outsourcing business is one of the things we take massive pride in.  These are the absolute best in class world corporations who are trusting with us the facilities they work in.  This is great, great stuff we’re seeing here."

I can’t help myself.  But here’s what I would say.  Again, I want to go back to the same thing, which is we’re in the early quarters of what I think is going to be a very exciting protracted recovery in the asset class.  And this is a particularly rocky, uneven recovery.  So -- and you know this as well as anyone on the phone call, where we saw recovery start was in the safest places, whether it was leasing or sales, what we saw when the recovery was people begin to make investments whether they’re owners or occupiers in those places they thought were bulletproof.  If they’re buying an asset, it was made in Manhattan, you’re going to open a data center or you were going to expand a corporate office, you were doing it in the places where you felt most certain about your business. As this recovery seasons, that recovery, and Gil referenced this earlier, that recovery begins to move a bit up the risk spectrum.  And so what you see is, you see assets and you’ve probably seen this personally, you’ve seen assets begin to trade in areas outside of Main and Main in Manhattan.  You see corporate, whether it’s retailer or industrial logistics firms, or big office clients, they begin to do things in markets outside of the major world financial centers.  It’s absolutely typical for an early-stage recovery and what we said a couple quarters ago, I just want to remind you again is, let’s look forward a year from now, or whether it’s 3 quarters or 5 quarters or whatever it’s going to be, this -- the strength you see in the major markets in both leasing and sales will have spread out to the secondary and even some of the tertiary markets.  That’s just a cycle this business goes through and will go through for a very long time, I think."

And what you saw in the results was that we saw in Europe and Asia accruing of the investment property markets.  So definitionally what -- let me translate that for you.  What you saw was hesitancy in closings.  What you saw was protracted closings.  What you saw was canceled closings.  When you see an investment -- capital market cool down, that’s what’s going on.  On the leasing side, it’s a little bit different.  On the leasing side, generally speaking, when occupiers launch a property search and they get into a negotiation to lease 20,000 square feet of retail or 100,000 square feet of office, they don’t generally collapse negotiations and walk away.  It’s a little more -- I guess it’s a little more sticky and that’s why, by the way, the leafing -- if you look over the last 20 years, just look at the deltas in leasing revenues, they are much, much less volatile than what you see in the capital markets and it’s a lot about that.  I think anecdotally, what I would say to you is that for the last eight quarters, what we’ve seen is [inaudible] and starts.  And you and I have talked about it, it’s, you know, you get some traction going in the spring of 2011 and people feel that things are a lot better and then there’s a shock to the system, the euro sovereign debt issue.  And the suddenly the brakes are put on again.  And then you get some traction again and then there’s China housing bubble issue. I think that we’re going to continue to see these kinds of things through the business until this recovery really gets it’s sea legs and it’s not there.  It’s getting incrementally better every quarter.  The fundamentals that Mike Lafitte referenced are getting better every quarter.  But it’s going to be a bumpy ride I think for a bit. But again, I want to put that in context.  You know, if I’m describing a bumpy ride and revenues are up 14% for the quarter and EBITDA is up 25% for the quarter and we’re reaffirming guidance, we’re telling you our margins are going to expand, I’ll take that bumpy ride all day long."

And it is, again, something that is on the menu of items.  But short of something that is going to be accretive and very positive for us and strategic, de-levering is really the order of the day.

The macro market trends that have prevailed for most of 2011 have generally continued in the first quarter of 2012. The market is recovering, but at an incremental and uneven pace. While no 2 recoveries are identical, this current one is marked by mixed performance across geographies and market sectors.
That being said, our highly productive market-leading and diversified platform helped us deliver a strong opening quarter for 2012. We especially benefited from strong performance in the Americas, and in a moment Mike Lafitte, our president of the Americas, will describe our integrated Americas business platform in a bit more detail.
Not unexpectedly, EMEA performance weakened versus the prior year first quarter, as transaction activity has slowed against tough economic conditions. In Asia Pacific, while there was overall revenue growth, investment sales in the region cooled a bit. We also saw material and immediate contributions from the addition of the ING Real Estate Investment Management people, programs and platform to our investment management business. We expect these positive contributions to continue as we complete our integration process.
Our global outsourcing business continued to make strong gains, with revenue growing by double digits for the 6th consecutive quarter. Both total contracts signed and new wins set records, and we surpassed the 3 billion square foot managed milestone.
In our transaction businesses, leasing resumed growth with a 3% gain over the first quarter of 2011. Investment sales revenue increased 10%, and also deserving special mention is commercial mortgage brokerage, which jumped 46%.
As a result of all this, we posted solid 14% revenue growth and even stronger, 25%, normalized EBITDA growth, during the quarter. And I am particularly pleased to report that our EBITDA margin expanded 90 bps, to 11.1%.
Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown on Slide 5. As is our practice, I will not go through them individually but we have included them here for your review. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Lafitte, our president of the Americas, to discuss his real strong performance in the Americas business. Mike?"

As you have read in our earnings release and as Brett mentioned, our Americas business had excellent performance in the first quarter of 2012. We are very pleased to achieve 13% revenue growth and 29",1220,"Thank you Brett. Please advance to Slide 6 if you will. As you have read in our earnings release and as Brett mentioned, our Americas business had excellent performance in the first quarter of 2012. We are very pleased to achieve 13% revenue growth and 29% normalized EBITDA growth in a sluggish economic environment. Credit for this goes to our nearly 21,000 Americas employees, who are intensely focused on providing superior service to our clients and maintaining disciplined expense control.
We took tough actions in 2011 to align our cost base to the difficult operating environment, and we are now seeing some benefits from those actions.
In the Americas, we have built a very large, deep, diverse, highly-integrated and arguably unparalleled platform. It took many years and considerable investment to build this robust platform and to integrate its component parts so they worked together cohesively. We are focused on continuous improvement of our platform to stay ahead of our evolving client needs.
Our financial business statistics for 2011 shown here were just published late last week. They underscore the magnitude of our platform. Even in a lukewarm market environment, we closed more than 38,000 sales and lease transactions in the Americas, valued at approximately $92 billion. You can see this activity was evenly split between sales and leasing.
Our people specialize in each of the major product segments: office, industrial, retail and the multi-housing space. This specialization provides unique expertise and insight, which positions us very well to capture market opportunities.
Our valuation platform is also robust. We maintain the largest market position in this space, serving financial institutions, corporations and special servicers, and there is great synergy with both our capital markets and our outsourcing business in the valuation space.
Our commercial mortgage brokerage business involves loan origination and sales, which is growing well as liquidity returns to the investment markets. Americas’ loan origination volumes rose nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2012 versus a year earlier. We do significant work with government agencies. For 2011, the Mortgage Bankers Association ranked us number one originator of government agency loans. The volume of work with these agencies has continued to grow into 2012.
Through our joint venture with GE Capital, GEMSA, we are also one of the industry’s largest loan servicers, with over $100 billion of loans being serviced today.
In our 1.6 billion square foot Americas property and corporate facilities portfolio, we are achieving strong growth by focusing on winning trophy asset assignments from institutional loaners as well as occupiers. You saw an example on the previous Slide, the 4.2 million square foot Houston center, which we are now managing for JP Morgan Investment Management.
Project leasing is also a core offering in our outsourcing portfolio, and is highly synergistic with our leasing business. We managed over $13 billion in projects during 2011. Strong growth opportunities also exist for us throughout Latin America and our Canadian operations. They now account for 11% of the Americas revenue for the first quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 7. These are new statistics published this month by National Real Estate Investor. You’ll see that our sales and lease transaction value in the Americas approaches or greatly exceeds the global activity for any other firm. We compete with many firms in different markets across the region. Many are focused on certain niches, such as tenant representation, or sales, or finance area. Few have the depth and breadth of our service platform, and none have achieved our scale or our market position.
Please turn to Slide 8. This slide illustrates how we put our powerful platform to work for our clients. In leasing, some of our largest 2012 closed transactions are depicted here. First, we represented Carter’s, an infant clothes retailer, in connection with a lease for a 1 million square foot distribution facility outside of Atlanta. Site selection was done with the assistance of our labor analytics group. You may know that we represented Condé Nast last year in its 1 million square foot lease at One World Trade Center in New York. Condé Nast continues to grow and has taken an additional 139,000 square feet in the building. Ceva Logistics and E*Trade are both broker-led outsourcing accounts. We have long-term contracts with them to perform transaction work across the region. Accounts like these generate approximately 15% of our Americas leasing revenue. In capital markets, Hess Tower is yet another example of a great platform story. This trophy office building in Houston was developed by the Trammell Crow Company along with principal real estate investors and sold recently for a record price. Seabury Service Platform played a key role in assisting the Trammell Crow Company in principal, first in managing the asset and serving as the agent in a lease to Hess, then in the sale to H&R REIT, a Canadian open-ended REIT. Our debt and equity finance team also arranged a $250 million loan for H&R to finance the purchase. The Mount Airy transaction noted here, which closed last week, is evidence of Seabury’s unique comprehensive capabilities. This is a $165 million recapitalization of a Poconos resort and casino. Our investment banking group, CBRE Capital Advisors, acted as exclusive financial advisor and co-arranger in a syndicated loan. The last example is representative of our growing impact in Latin America. We arranged a $100 million sale of a class A asset in the heart of Santiago’s business district. CBRE’s local team in Chile collaborated with our U.S. capital markets professionals in the sale of this tower on behalf of a German open-ended fund, a truly cross-border transaction.
Please turn to Slide 9. Outsourcing continues to be our single largest business line. Its 45% share of the Americas revenue in the first quarter is a little high due to seasonality, slower leasing and sales activity in the first quarter. For the full year in 2011, it accounted for 39% of the Americas revenue. The business continues to grow at a double digit pace. In asset services, we are focused on large, strategic accounts. Our goal is to deliver multiple synergistic services for those institutions and to be their preferred provider throughout the entire life cycle of their investment. There are currently about 30 strategic accounts in total. The 5 largest are listed here in alphabetical order. On the corporate services side, we are continuing to rapidly on-board new clients and expand our service offering with current clients. Of the record 58 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2012, more than 40 are in the Americas and others are global relationships, generally with significant Americas component. I’d like to comment on just a few of these. First, for Deloitte, we provide variable project management services for its space throughout the United States. We recently added and extended this nine-year relationship. Additionally, we won new facilities managements assignments with Microsoft and NYSE Euronext, demonstrating our ability to nurture and grow client relationships. Adventist Health Systems and the University of Cincinnati are emblematic of our increasing penetration of the healthcare and education markets. These sectors, as well as government, face enormous pressure to become more efficient, and we believe the opportunity is large as outsourcing adoption in this space is in its infancy. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Gil."

Total revenue was approximately $1.35 billion for the first quarter of 2012, up 14% from last year. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management, commercial mortgage brokerage and to a lesser degree, leasing. Normalized EBITDA grew at a stronger pace than revenue, up 25%, to $150.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, from $120.6 million in the first quarter of 2011, delivering a normalized EBITDA margin of 11.1% or an increase of 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2011. Our cost of services decreased to 58% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to 60.2% in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 operating expenses were 32.6% of total revenue, versus 31.8% in the first quarter of 2011. This offsetting impact on the cost of services and operating expenses resulted from the inclusion of ING REIM expenses, all of which flowed through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services. Interest expense increased by $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to the ING REIM and Sterling Term Loan A-1 financings, which occurred after the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 42%. Consistent with prior years, this is seasonally higher than the anticipated full-year tax rate. We expect the full-year 2012 tax rate to be a little below 40%. First quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $.08 versus $.11 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $.14 versus $.13 in the first quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 11. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the first quarter of 2012, representing 39% of total revenue in the quarter, with a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2011. Leasing was our second largest service line, representing 27% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2012, with increases in both Asia Pacific and the Americas. Investment sales showed a solid increase of 10% in the first quarter of 2012, driven by the Americas, and accounted for 13% of this quarter’s total revenue. Global investment management revenue more than doubled quarter over quarter, driven by increases in asset management and incentive fees, attributable to the ING REIM businesses. Appraisal and valuation revenue increased 6% to $79.7 million. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue jumped 46% year over year, driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads, and investors’ continued search for yield. Development services revenue was down approximately $3 million. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprises approximately 62% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2012.
Slide 12 demonstrates stabilized vacancy rates and effective positive absorption in all 3 market sectors depicted, along with forecasted improvement over the next 2 years. The capital and investment sales volume data that we typically show is not yet available due to our slightly earlier reporting date this quarter.
Please turn to Slide 13. Sales revenue in the Americas increased 33% in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011, still driven by activities in core markets. Market share data for the first quarter of 2012 is not yet available, but we are pleased to note that late last week CBRE closed the largest single asset investment sale on the west coast since 2006, the $480 million sale of Russell Investment Center in Seattle. This transaction is indicative of the activity that appears to be surfacing in secondary markets. Our Americas leasing revenue increased modestly in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, in line with our expectations. During the first quarter of 2012, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained constant at 16% compared to the 4th quarter of 2011. The Americas outsourcing business grew a solid 11% in the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 14. Our EMEA investment sales revenue decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011. This weakness comes as no surprise, as economic challenges in the region persist, causing market-wide investment activity to decline 18%. CBRE’s EMEA leasing revenue decreased 6% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011. This weakness stems from caution around large space commitments, somewhat upset by stability and prime rent. It should be noted that France, which had an exceptional first quarter in 2011 in transaction activity, that tapered off as 2011 progressed, was largely responsible for the decrease in sales and leasing. Outsourcing slowed a bit, with revenue only increasing 6% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011, driven by new assignment. EMEA decrease and normalized EBITDA resulted mainly from the reduction of the aforementioned higher-margin transaction revenues, the additional compensation expense associated with retention and severance, in part related to acquisitions, as well as slightly higher occupancy costs.
Please turn to Slide 15. CBRE’s sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased 34% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011, primarily driven by a cooling of activity across the region as decisions were delayed due to global economic uncertainty. CBRE’s leasing revenue in the Asia Pacific grew 8% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to the first quarter of 2011. Some growth was evident in most markets, led by Australia and India. Asia Pacific saw outsourcing growth of 10% in the first quarter of 2012, versus the first quarter of 2011, as it continues to gain adoption in this region. Asia Pacific’s first quarter 2012 normalized EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by the aforementioned reduction in higher-margin investment sales revenue, investment in China and the favorable impact of a notable bonus accrual reversal in the first quarter of 2011 that did not recur this year.
Please turn to Slide 16. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2012, versus $19.2 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees and lower rental revenue, driven by property dispositions in the later quarters of 2011. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, in-process development totaled $4.8 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.3 billion. Our equity co-investments at the end of the first quarter of 2012 in the development services business totaled $93.6 million.
Please turn to Slide 17. First quarter 2012 global investment management revenue increased to $125.2 million, from $51.4 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from higher asset management and incentive fees, stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM, which contributed approximately $85 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Assets Under Management, or AUM, totaled $95.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2012, up about $1.8 billion from year-end 2011, primarily due to increases in valuation and benefits from currency fluctuations. In the first quarter of 2012, total AUM in the direct real estate business was impacted by $300 million of asset acquisitions, $1.1 billion of dispositions and transfers and $1.2 billion from improvement in asset values.
In addition, currency fluctuations increased AUM by $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2012. Included in the $95.9 billion in AUM at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was $21.7 billion of listed securities. Changes in market valuation in this portfolio increased AUM by $1.9 billion in the quarter versus the 4th quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, in the direct real estate business, we raised new capital of approximately $400 million and had approximately $2.8 billion of capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $176.9 million.
Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 18. In the first quarter of 2012, we incurred $10 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisitions, primarily for retention and severance. As of March 31, 2012, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $44 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 36% for the first quarter of 2012. If you recall, this is right within the range in which we anticipated we would operate at the time we announced the ING REIM acquisition.
Slide 19 shows our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. This is virtually unchanged as compared to year-end 2011, and we remain very comfortable with this schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to Slide 20. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.9 billion. This represents an increase from year-end 2011, primarily due to incentive compensation payments, which are generally made in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.7%, similar to the end of 2011 when including interest rate swaps. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.81 times at the end of the first quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA stood at 2.29 times. I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

Updates on our view for the year are that outsourcing is likely to continue strong growth. Recent growth rates across the globe will track job creation, and should continue to be modest for the time being. Investment sales growth is going to be dependent on specific regional market dynamics, noting that the economic climate in EMEA is challenged and there has been a recent cooling in Asia Pacific.
And finally the investment management will benefit from a full-year contribution from the acquired ING Real Estate Investment Management businesses. With the first quarter now behind us, we are maintaining our view from year-end 2011. First, that our EPS guidance remains unchanged, and second, that we should see solid EBITDA margin expansion.

It’s funny in the 4th quarter, we had a soft compare against one competitor on leasing numbers in a quarter. And we spent some time talking about that and letting all of you know that this is a very big, very powerful, integrated business, and we focus on lots of things all the time. And any time we see a competitor or our competitive position at risk, or a competitor coming in and, as you said “nipping at our heels”, we redouble our efforts to correct that situation. Now, ironically or not, the belle of the ball this quarter is guess what? Americas. And by the way, that’s why we brought Michael Lafitte in, because that business is so much more than U.S. leasing. There’s no competitor even close to what we do in our U.S. integrated business, and that’s why we had Mike talk about it. In terms of the competitive landscape on sales and leasing, you know this industry is, and we’ve been talking about this for so many years I can’t even remember when we started. But this industry is rapidly consolidating down to 2 groups of players and we’ve got on the global landscape, I think we’ve got 2 big, high-quality, multinational integrated companies out there. And we’ve got thousands of boutique firms out there that do whatever they do really, really well in single markets or single business lines. And we’ve got these folks stuck in the middle, they’re going away so fast it’s almost hard to keep track of it at this point. By the way, we love that dynamic. We love it because every day more and more of the accounts that we want to own, that we want to do business with, are turning to use for their services.
The competitive landscape on lease and sales in the U.S. and globally is really a tale of 2 stories, or 2 tales. The first is, that in the U.S. the leasing landscape is a very, very competitive marketplace. We are dominant in that marketplace and expect to remain so. However, the competitors that we had just 3 years ago, some of them are gone, and that share is going to be spread among other competitors in the business, and you should expect to see that going forward. On the sale side, that marketplace is one we’ve dominated for many, many years and our competitive position in the sale space, if any, just gets better and better. So, we like where we sit.

It sounds to me like the BCG, I think that’s right, it sounds like these players are sophisticated, they’re smart, they purport to be well capitalized. I think that’s great. And I think that this elimination of this middle group of firms, it’s just inevitable, it’s absolutely -- it’s going to get done. We’re watching it get done. And the way that that’s going to happen is, there’s only a few choices. They either go bankrupt and just disappear off the face of the earth, but these businesses have people in them. And so, if a good well-heeled company like BCG or another can come in and pick up the pieces of these failed firms, I think that’s great. I know a lot of people inside those businesses, particularly Grub and Ellis, these are high-quality good people and the fact that they’ve found a home with an owner that’s excited about the industry, I think is a plus for everybody. I don’t think being owned by one type of owner or another is necessarily an advantage or a disadvantage. It all comes down to leadership, it all comes down to the people, and it all comes down to platform. There’s a very, very long wave that any of these aggregators need the distance to go to, to get to the level where I think these couple big multinational firms are, is a huge distance. But you know what? Having folks that want to be there, having folks that are aspirational, having folks that are putting capital into this industry is a net benefit for everybody, they make us all better, and we welcome them to the dance. It’s all good. And by the way, it’s way better, that these firms that have gone through these horrible problems that they’ve had, again it’s way better that the good things inside those firms, which is the people, have found a place to land and do business and stay in the business in the marketplace. That benefits all of us."

We’re deep in mid-caps, we’re deep in healthcare, so, we’re very focused on landing new customers, and we’re doing that a lot. The second I would say is productivity advances that we’re focused on around our leasing professionals; training, specialty practice groups that are raising up in very specific niches, they are really take us into new areas, they can actually expand our own business. Certainly strategic hiring is part of it, and we’ve continued to remain very active on the hiring front through all of the down turn, we are always in the marketplace for great talent. Through ’08, and ’09, and ’10, and ’11, we were adding and attracting great talent to our company at the mid and the higher levels for the most parts -- always with a program to grow our own. And then, lastly, is improving fundamentals that I think will -- that are ahead of us in some of those metrics that you asked about, and now Gil and Brett, you may want to comment on those metrics that we do track.

And David, just on the numbers, let me fill in some numbers that Mike was referencing. First, on the fundamentals, as you saw from the deck, what we’re seeing in marketplaces, not surprising at all -- we’re in, again, I think, early innings of a protracted recovery, all though it’s uneven and incremental. So vacancy rates are very slowly coming down. We’re seeing absorption, positive absorption bounce around, but it is positive. And we’re seeing CAP rates on slowly coming down as well. All of that, of course, is what Mike is referring to, and it augers towards an improving recovery as we look forward. On the actual sale and lease numbers for the U.S., I’ll give you a few numbers. On the sale side, what we had was a fairly strong pick up in number of transactions first quarter 2011, or first quarter ’12, and in the U.S., for instance, that was 11% higher. On the average transaction side, and again this is just U.S., it’s not Americas, what we saw there was a 25% increase in transaction size, and these together produce a 37% increase in reported sales revenue first-quarter-over-first-quarter, year-over-year. Now, I want you to be careful, these numbers bounce around, because we are the early stages of recovery, but that’s what sales was for the first quarter. On the leasing side, it was generally flat year-over-year, and we look at office leasing and where the real pick up was, was actually in retail and industrial. And those together gave us, in the U.S. at least, a 5% increase in reported leasing revenue year-over-year. Again, these numbers bounce around because that’s where we are at this point in the cycle, but as Mike said, and as we’ve mentioned in our deck here, the leasing business is all about job growth, and job growth has been true net job growth has not been anything to write home about for a while. When that picks up and it will, leasing numbers will pick up along with it, and sometimes they pick up in an outsized way when you see real job growth. The sale side actually is chugging along in the U.S. pretty well, and we talk about the slowness in Europe and Asia."

There’s lots of capital flowing around the world that can support the purchase of high quality, investment grade, commercial real estate. Now that having been said the real issue at the moment in Europe is just uncertainty, and it’s -- whenever we talk about this, we talk about it in 2008, 2009, 2010, and last year. When you have uncertainty in a market place it makes it hard to find pricing, and -- so, when there’s uncertainty in the market place, people just slow down and they take their time and they do a lot more work to make sure that they have got a view on pricing, and right now in Europe, I think the story is more about uncertainty in the market place which slows down transaction volume, if it is a lack of financing to buy an asset. If you and I want to go out to London, or to Paris, or to Amsterdam, or for that matter New York, or Huston, or L.A., and buy a high quality asset, we’ll get the financing to do it.

And we’re in an interesting environment in that we’re winning so much business right now that it’s actually hurting the margin a bit because these are big, big accounts and they come in depending on the account, they could turn run rate margin level and profitable 6 months in, but more likely, it might be a year in or even a bit more. So it’s an interesting -- it’s a high-class problem to have that we’re winning so much new business that this now is impactful in a negative way on the margins. And as I said on the 4th quarter call, if you just kind of do the math in your head, if you want the margins to move up nicely, you actually stop winning new business and then you’d get there in 8 to 12 months. We’re not going to stop winning new business. But I do think that this pace of winning, it’s unprecedented. I’ve never seen anything like it. And I think that that will normalize and become a steadier process for us in the last couple of years. But the margins will get back to a number that I think is more typical for us; part of it will be these accounts, these big, big accounts we’re getting, seasoning in, part will be just a change in marketplace. Again, we’ve got an expert on the phone that might want to speak with us. Mike, you understand the question well, and this is the issue of we bring in these huge accounts, we don’t necessarily lose money on them in the early days, but we certainly aren’t making a lot of money.

It’s the investments that then also fuel the growth of our business. So we are investing back into our platform in a big way; in people and in technology and all those things. I would submit to you that our corporate services professionals would say yes, the more GCS business we’re going to add in overall relative to all of our lines of business may not be the highest margin business, but I would submit that they’re all still --  have nice trajectories -- trajectory of growth. And our margins are pretty consistent year over year in that business. It’s not a loss leader by any stretch. We’re in that business to make money and find new ways to serve our clients in the higher-end margin pieces too. So if we land an FM account, it’s not unusual to find ourselves in a consulting role, doing capital markets transactions, doing sale leaseback transactions and adding on other services that can bolt onto those relationships. So often times they are the gateway to just tremendous activity down the road with very, very long, 15-20 year, relationships."

I just want to stress it for our callers, which is the way in which we account within our P&L the various revenues that flow off of various business can be a little tricky. And so when you look at a single line and you look at the outsourcing business, for instance, and you all know this on the phone call. It is not the entire picture. Lots of the higher margin revenues that flow off these accounts aren’t captured in that segment. They’re captured in leasing, they’re captured in -- as Mike just said, they’re captured in sales, they’re captured in valuation. And so just to paraphrase or say a different way from what Mike said, when we tell you that in 2012, in a very tricky global economic environment, that our margins will see solid growth, part of the story there is higher margin work flowing from these corporate accounts, even though the corporate account segment you’re looking at, but it looked like the margins went down a bit because these businesses came in, transition costs, et cetera. So I think Mike makes a very good point. The big picture story here is that this business, the other businesses we have all play a role in a firm that’s been able to grow margins quarter, over quarter, over quarter in up cycles and we intend to continue that going forward. And by the way if having growth like this in the outsourcing business is one of the things we take massive pride in. These are the absolute best in class world corporations who are trusting with us the facilities they work in. This is great, great stuff we’re seeing here."

I can’t help myself. But here’s what I would say. Again, I want to go back to the same thing, which is we’re in the early quarters of what I think is going to be a very exciting protracted recovery in the asset class. And this is a particularly rocky, uneven recovery. So -- and you know this as well as anyone on the phone call, where we saw recovery start was in the safest places, whether it was leasing or sales, what we saw when the recovery was people begin to make investments whether they’re owners or occupiers in those places they thought were bulletproof. If they’re buying an asset, it was made in Manhattan, you’re going to open a data center or you were going to expand a corporate office, you were doing it in the places where you felt most certain about your business. As this recovery seasons, that recovery, and Gil referenced this earlier, that recovery begins to move a bit up the risk spectrum.  And so what you see is, you see assets and you’ve probably seen this personally, you’ve seen assets begin to trade in areas outside of Main and Main in Manhattan. You see corporate, whether it’s retailer or industrial logistics firms, or big office clients, they begin to do things in markets outside of the major world financial centers. It’s absolutely typical for an early-stage recovery and what we said a couple quarters ago, I just want to remind you again is, let’s look forward a year from now, or whether it’s 3 quarters or 5 quarters or whatever it’s going to be, this -- the strength you see in the major markets in both leasing and sales will have spread out to the secondary and even some of the tertiary markets. That’s just a cycle this business goes through and will go through for a very long time, I think."

And what you saw in the results was that we saw in Europe and Asia accruing of the investment property markets. So definitionally what -- let me translate that for you. What you saw was hesitancy in closings. What you saw was protracted closings. What you saw was canceled closings. When you see an investment -- capital market cool down, that’s what’s going on. On the leasing side, it’s a little bit different. On the leasing side, generally speaking, when occupiers launch a property search and they get into a negotiation to lease 20,000 square feet of retail or 100,000 square feet of office, they don’t generally collapse negotiations and walk away. It’s a little more -- I guess it’s a little more sticky and that’s why, by the way, the leafing -- if you look over the last 20 years, just look at the deltas in leasing revenues, they are much, much less volatile than what you see in the capital markets and it’s a lot about that. I think anecdotally, what I would say to you is that for the last eight quarters, what we’ve seen is [inaudible] and starts. And you and I have talked about it, it’s,  you get some traction going in the spring of 2011 and people feel that things are a lot better and then there’s a shock to the system, the euro sovereign debt issue. And the suddenly the brakes are put on again. And then you get some traction again and then there’s China housing bubble issue. I think that we’re going to continue to see these kinds of things through the business until this recovery really gets it’s sea legs and it’s not there. It’s getting incrementally better every quarter. The fundamentals that Mike Lafitte referenced are getting better every quarter. But it’s going to be a bumpy ride I think for a bit. But again, I want to put that in context.  if I’m describing a bumpy ride and revenues are up 14% for the quarter and EBITDA is up 25% for the quarter and we’re reaffirming guidance, we’re telling you our margins are going to expand, I’ll take that bumpy ride all day long."

And it is, again, something that is on the menu of items. But short of something that is going to be accretive and very positive for us and strategic, de-levering is really the order of the day. And we’ve got a reason to do it with expensive debt coming due in June of ’13. But at the moment, we’re in a bit of wait-and-see, that is looming and we are still in early days in terms of the cycle, so there may be opportunities, nothing definitive enough that we are going to talk about.

I am glad we have Bob joining our call today. Bob’s well known to most of you. I know you will enjoy interacting with him more regularly as he gears to assume the CEO duty at the end of the year.
We are very pleased with our results for the quarter. We grew our topline by double-digits, improved our bottomline by nearly 30% and increased our normalized EBITDA margin by 170 basis points. Our stronger performance reflects a broad well balanced global platform we have built over two decades. One of which strengthens and certain the compliance in markets, compensates weaknesses in others. It also demonstrates our ability to control costs while executing on our growth strategy.
Right now the Americas is experiencing the best of all our region. Our permanent position in markets across the U.S. Canada and Latin America has enabled us to sustain double-digit revenue and profit growth despite the lack of meaningful job creation. Asia-Pacific achieved solid growth in the second quarter as well; notwithstanding China’s economic slowdown. As expected, EMEA saw softer results as it continue to fight formidable headwind related to both the Euro zone’s ongoing economic and debt issues and notable negative currency effects.
Benefits continue to accrue from our acquisition of the ING REIM businesses last year. We believe that the blending of ING REIM’s professional talent with our own has forged a new industry leader in real estate investment management and have certainly given us an enhanced stream of stable revenue at higher margins than most of our other businesses.
The 25% normalized EBITDA margin that this business achieved during the quarter served us particularly well in a choppy market environment and we expect positive contributions from the ING REIM acquisition to continue.
Our global outsourcing business continue to make strong gains with double-digit revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. We signed 54 total contracts including 24 with new outsourcing customers, staying a company record for new wins in a quarter. This business continues to exhibit good momentum for reasons we will discuss later.
Our capital markets business has also performed well. Although a small component of total company revenue, mortgage brokerage had robust revenue growth of 36% as loan origination volumes and related servicing demand continue to rise.
While still a relatively moderate portion of overall revenue, property sales moved higher in all regions paced by the Americas, reflecting generally soft occupier market condition particular in Europe, property leasing edged up slightly on a global basis. The Americas and Asia-Pacific accounted for the increase.
While the global market recovery progresses, macro challenges continue to limit it's strength. Nonetheless, CBRE continues to be in an advantageous position. Our unique combination of people, brand and mature global platform gives us the ability to perform well for clients and shareholders and to build market spirit across our spectrum of services.
So on here, on slide five, our noble transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter. As usual, I'll not go through them individually, but we've included them for your review.
And with that, Gil, I'll turn the call over to you to go through the financial deck.

Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2012, up 12% from last year or 13% when excluding discontinued operations. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management and commercial mortgage brokerage.
Normalized EBITDA improved at more than twice the pace of revenue, rising 28% to $220.9 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $172.4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and our normalized EBITDA margin expanded by 170 basis points to 13.8%.
Cost of services felled 240 basis points to 56.7% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 versus 59.1% in the second quarter of 2011. This reduction was primarily driven by the fact that all costs associated with ING REIM, which were not present in the second quarter of 2011, drove through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services. Despite the inclusion of all of ING REIM’s costs in operating expenses, this line was essentially flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the second quarter of 2011 indicating effective cost management.
In the Americas and Asia-Pacific consistent with historical patterns, positive operating leverage was readily apparent. Due to the more fixed nature of costs in many parts of Europe and the rapid declining leasing revenues in EMEA during the quarter such operating leverage was not yet as evident in this region.
Interest expense increased by $10.2 million in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the full impact from the financing of ING REIM and the Sterling denominated term loan A1 facility that we were not present in the second quarter of 2011.
Our second quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 40% and we expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be a little below this. Second quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.23 versus $0.19 last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.27 versus $0.21 in the second quarter of 2011 an increase of almost 30%.
Please turn to slide seven. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the second quarter of 2012 representing 34% of total revenue in the quarter with a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.
Leasing was our second largest service line representing 30% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 with increases in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.
Investment sales accelerated to a growth rate of 16% in the second quarter of 2012 driven by the Americas with positive contributions from EMEA and Asia-Pacific as well. It represented 16% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2012.
Global investment and management revenue more than doubled again quarter-over-quarter driven by increases in asset management fees attributable to the ING REIM businesses.
Appraisal and valuation revenue increased 6% to $95.2 million led by business in Asia-Pacific that was acquired late in the second quarter of 2011.
Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue grew 36% year-over-year driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors continued search for yield.
Development services revenue was up slightly to $15.5 million.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 57% of total revenue for the second quarter of 2012.
Although not our typical sequence, I will briefly cover our debt maturity and capitalization table before handing the call over to Bob. Slide eight shows the amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. This is virtually unchanged from the first quarter of 2012. With considerable liquidity and cash flow we remain very comfortable with our debt maturity schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to slide nine. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities, not available for company use and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and our mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the second quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.9 billion. This is flat as compared to the end of first quarter of 2012 and up versus the end of 2011 due to bonuses and other incentive compensation payments made in the first half of the year. Consistent with historical trends, our net debt is expected to decrease as the year progresses.
At the end of the second quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.7% when including interest rate swaps similar to the end of the first quarter of 2012. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.76 times at the end of the second quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12 month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA stood at 2.19 times. I will now turn the call over to Bob who will cover business line performance.

In the second quarter of this year, we",1432,"Thanks Gill, I am glad to once again to be joining these calls on a regular basis. Please turn to slide 10. Our outsourcing business continued its pattern of consistent growth driven by record new account additions. In the second quarter of this year, we signed 54 contracts, the second highest total in company history. 
We landed 24 new accounts, the most ever for a single quarter, 21 renewals and 9 expansions. All of this contract activity in the second quarter and for many prior quarters suggests very strong underlying momentum in our outsourcing business and we expect that momentum to continue well into the future. 
The outsourcing trend is being propelled by globalization and the desire by occupiers of all sizes and across industries to increase efficiency and improve all our overall performance particularly in light of the global economic slowdown. For this reason, this business has significant headroom for growth. We believe there is as much as $50 billion to $60 billion in total market potential. 
We are poised to capture a significant percentage in this opportunity by delivering services to more space users and establish outsourcing markets as well as newer markets. For example, we see big potential among midcap companies which accounted for more than a third of our total contracts in the second quarter. 
We also continue to add customers in the government and healthcare sectors where cost pressures are especially acute. We saw evidence of this in the second quarter with three new contracts in the government sector and three new contracts plus a client expansion in the healthcare sector. 
In addition, four large corporations selected us to provide various services to their properties in Latin America and we were hired by Sony to handle transaction management and lease administration in Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
Please turn to slide 11, which demonstrates steadily decreasing vacancy rates and positive absorption in all three market sectors depicted along with forecasted improvement over the next two years. Average national cap rates were slightly down in the second quarter versus both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year primarily due to continued strength in core and Class A property sales. 
Please turn to slide 12; the Americas posted very good growth in property sales revenue in the second quarter which continued to be driven by activity in core markets with modest improvement in secondary markets. 
Our position as a market leader across asset sectors, office, industrial, retail and multifamily and our ability to provide integrated equity and debt solutions are clearly a distinct advantage. Our CA data shows that we improved market share by 230 basis points from a year ago to 16.2% in the second quarter of this year, once again the highest in the industry. 
Leasing markets generally showed some improvement in the second quarter with vacancy rates declining modestly. During the quarter, the US office vacancy rates fell 30 basis points to 15.7% compared to the first quarter of this year, indicating that our office market recovery remains intact. Market fundamentals continue to be helped by very low levels of new construction, occupier demand however remains modest. In light of this, second quarter leasing revenue increase of 5% is a good result and inline with our expectations.
This growth reflects our premier position in key business centers such as New York City, where we negotiated four of the five largest leased transactions in the first half of this year. Our Americas' outsourcing business grew by a strong 13% in the second quarter.
Please turn to slide 13. In EMEA, property sales provided a positive surprise, despite almost daily headlines about the Euro Zone debt crisis and heightened investor anxiety. Our EMEA sales revenue rose 3% in the second quarter excluding the notable impact of negative foreign currency movement. EMEA sales revenue grew by 11%.
We’re especially pleased with this outcome given the property sales activity across most of the EMEA as weak. Recent performance show greater effects from the flat lining economies across Europe. While average rents across the region have remained relatively stable, occupiers have been hesitant to make commitments in the current environment. 
As a result, EMEA leasing revenue decreased 17% in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same quarter in 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, leasing declined 10% in the second quarter versus second quarter last year.
Consistent with our first quarter results, France in particular had a very negative comparison against a strong second quarter in 2011. The EMEA outsourcing revenue was flat in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. 
This was primarily driven by negative foreign currency movements excluding the impact of foreign currency outsourcing revenue grew 9%. Our total revenue in EMEA declined 5%. However, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange it grew 3%.
Please turn to slide 14. Asia-Pacific generated solid growth in all three major business lines during the second quarter. We saw excellent performance in Japan as the economy there continue to recover from last year’s natural disaster and the related investment in infrastructure continued. 
Investors increasingly proceed towards Japan as a safe heaven and a near integral part of any overall Asia investment strategy. Australia, India and Singapore all performed well despite moderating global economic activity. Property sales revenue advanced 4% in the second quarter led by activity in Japan, excluding the impact of negative foreign currency movements the increase was 8%. 
Leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 6% with growth evident in almost all geographies excluding the impact of foreign exchange growth was 9%. Outsourcing revenue improved by 5% in the second quarter versus the second quarter last year and excluding the impact of foreign exchange outsourcing revenue grew 13%. Our total revenue growth in Asia Pacific was 11% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Please turn to slide 15. Revenue for the development of services segment totaled $17.8 million in the second quarter versus $17.2 million in the second quarter last year. Second quarter EBITDA declined by $6.6 million from the second quarter of last year due to higher profits from property sales in the prior year quarter. At the end of the second quarter, in process development totaled $4.7 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.4 billion. Our equity core investments at the end of the second quarter in development services totaled $89.2 million and our recourse debt stood at only $15 million. 
Please turn to slide 16, second quarter 2012 global investment management revenue increased to $119.7 million from $58.9 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees largely stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM which contributed approximately $7 million revenue in the second quarter. 
Assets under management or AUM totaled $91.2 billion at the end of the second quarter down from $95.9 billion at the end of the first quarter this year. $2.8 billion of the draft was due to a non-traded reach board's decision to internalize its management. In addition, AUM declined in the current quarter by $1.8 billion due to currency fluctuations and $500 million due to declines in asset values primarily in Europe. 
And $400 million due to dispositions while acquisitions added $800 million to our assets under the management. Included in the $91.2 billion of AUM at the end of the second quarter was $21.4 billion of listed securities. Net outflows combined with changes in market valuation in this portfolio decreased AUM by $300 million dollars versus the end of first quarter. 
During the second quarter of this year, we raised new equity capital of approximately $700 million in the direct real estate business, and had approximately $2.6 billion of equity capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $215.1 million. 
Please turn to slide 17. Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation is shown here. In the second quarter of 2012, we incurred $9.1 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisition primarily for retention, severance, facilities and information technology.
As of June 30th this year, the company maintained accumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $40 million which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This reflects a reduction of $4 million from the end of the first quarter due to no income tax related distribution. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 25% for the second quarter of 2012.
Brett, I will now turn the call back over to you.

The commercial real estate recovery continues to progress at a historically slow pace relative to prior recoveries with a high degree of inconsistency globally. We are pleased that CBRE continues to perform well and we continue to build our position as a market leader
 Our views following the completion of the first half of 2012 are that outsourcing is expected to continue its strong consistent growth trend, leasing growth rates should be relatively modest, investment sales growth will vary widely depending on local and regional market dynamics and finally then investment management will benefit from a full year contribution from the acquired ING REIM businesses.
With the first half now behind us, we remain comfortable with our full year normalized EPS guidance at a $1.20 to $1.25 with higher normalized EBITDA margins than in 2011. However given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the global economic picture, we will take a close look at our guidance again at the conclusion of the third quarter which of course is our standard practice.
And with that operator, we’ll take now questions.

The first is the market is clearly expanding more quickly or has been expanding more quickly the last three, four years than it has in prior years.
So the business is maturing and more and more firms are coming to market with outsourcing contracts. The second dynamic though that greatly supports our firm is the movement of outsourcing work away from niche [boutique] and regional players over to true global firms, and so that trend which has been extinct for quite sometime, as you know Anthony, is a big benefiting dynamic to ourselves and to one other firm in the industry.

There seems to be a new issue as you know Anthony, in Europe, every week, every month.
So the market place in Europe is troubled and when you have a market place like that, what tends to happen is people freeze on making decisions around dispositions of real estate, acquisitions of real estate, expanding their business' footprint, contracting their business' footprint. Everybody take the time out until they can digest what is going on in their market place and this market is - Europe market is very dynamic.
I don't think anybody in Europe at the moment, we certainly can’t predict with any uncertainty what that marketplace is going to look like a month from now, much less a year from now and until that sort of view is available in the marketplace, until large customers of ours can look forward for a few quarters, may have some comfort around what that marketplace is going to be bring them, this market is going to remain troubled as you saw in the leasing volumes and you saw in the sales volumes. I do want to ask Bob who is on the line to add his commentary to this. Europe reports to Bob and he is much more closer to that situation than I am. Bob what would you like to add to that.

I think that’s a very good description of what’s going on. Obviously we saw a different circumstance with investment properties than we did with leasing in the last quarter and I think the explanation for that is in core markets and there certainly are some important core markets there, most notably London.
People are going to invest in real estate because they think they can get some yield. It’s so hard to get yield on anything you invest in today that there is going to be investment in core solid properties and we saw some of that. The flip side is for leasing, businesses simply aren’t going to make decisions with this much uncertainty and we saw real pressure in the leasing market. So that’s really the only thing that I would add to what Brett said and generally I agree with the whole description.

If you look at the second quarter in the US which is you talked about US market I will answer on US market. Number of transactions for us in the leasing business was basically flat. The length of lease in the second quarter was basically flat; it was actually down 1%.
But the average lease size was actually up 5% for the quarter, so those three dynamics which are the dynamics to give us revenue gives a 7% increase from reported leasing revenue for all product types in the second quarter of 2012 versus second quarter of 2011, that’s a decent number given this current market environment and there is nothing going on in that business that is materially different from what we forecast when we built our guidance for the year.

When we talk about taking material cost out, we'll talk about that when we are going to do something that likely fallen to restructuring charge and there is nothing going on in the business right now, that would lead us to talk about that at the moment.
But we are watching EMEA carefully obviously as you know, David but I'll look at the other callers I know as well, the cost structures in Europe are different than the Americas and Asia Pacific, and a lot of the cost that you have underpinning your business in Europe is more structural than it is, variable and its hard to get out in this another market.
So what tends to happen is it's in the [lack] of it in Europe on the cost side and I think the underscoring point that is important for our callers to understand is that as you saw in our performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year, we are paying a lot of attention to cost. And we are going to continue to pay a lot of attention to cost until these markets are stabilized in growing at a rate that we think indicates a good recovery.

That's just not as easy to do in Europe. But yeah, as we mentioned in our script earlier, one of the great benefits of this firm is that we are so highly diversified on product line. We have so many businesses that we benefit from that the firm can absorb issues like Europe right now and still post industry-leading margins and industry-leading profits. That's by design and that allows us to be patient with Europe, not to make draconian cuts to their cost structure because our Europe business is a terrific business and we are very comfortable with where they stand at the moment on their cost side, although we are concerned as Gill said on the revenue side.

I am happy to have Bob joining our call today. Bob’s well known to most of you. I know you will enjoy interacting with him more regularly as he gears to assume the CEO duty at the end of the year.
We are very pleased with our results for the quarter. We grew our top line by double-digits, improved our bottom line by nearly 30% and increased our normalized EBITDA margin by 170 basis points. Our strong performance reflects a broad well balanced global platform we have built over 2 decades. One in which strength in certain business lines and markets compensates for weaknesses in others. It also demonstrates our ability to control costs while executing on our growth strategy.
Right now the Americas is faring the best of all our region. Our permanent position in markets across the U.S. Canada and Latin America has enabled us to sustain double-digit revenue and profit growth despite the lack of meaningful job creation. Asia-Pacific achieved solid growth in the second quarter as well, notwithstanding China’s economic slowdown. As expected, EMEA saw softer results as it continued to fight formidable headwinds related to both the Euro zone’s ongoing economic and debt issues and notable negative currency effects.
Benefits continue to accrue from our acquisition of the ING REIM businesses last year. We believe that the blending of ING REIM’s professional talent with our own has forged a new industry leader in real estate investment management and have certainly given us an enhanced stream of stable revenue at higher margins than most of our other businesses.
The 25% normalized EBITDA margin that this business achieved during the quarter served us particularly well in a choppy market environment and we expect the positive contributions from the ING REIM acquisition to continue.
Our global outsourcing business continued to make strong gains with double-digit revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. We signed 54 total contracts including 24 with new outsourcing customers, setting a company record for new wins in a quarter. This business continues to exhibit good momentum for reasons we will discuss later.
Our capital markets business has also performed well. Although a small component of total company revenue, mortgage brokerage had robust revenue growth of 36% as loan origination volumes and related servicing demand continued to rise.
While still a relatively moderate portion of overall revenue, property sales moved higher in all regions paced by the Americas, reflecting generally soft occupier market condition particular in Europe, property leasing edged up slightly on a global basis. The Americas and Asia-Pacific accounted for the increase.
While the global market recovery progresses, macro challenges continue to limit its strength. Nonetheless, CBRE continues to be in an advantageous position. Our unique combination of people, brand and mature global platform gives us the ability to perform well for clients and shareholders and to build marketshare across our spectrum of services.
Shown here on Slide 5, our noble transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter. As usual, I'll not go through them individually, but we've included them for your review.
And with that, Gil, I'll turn the call over to you to go through the financial deck."

Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2012, up 12% from last year or 13% when excluding discontinued operations. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management and commercial mortgage brokerage.
Normalized EBITDA improved at more than twice the pace of revenue, rising 28% to $220.9 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $172.4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and our normalized EBITDA margin expanded by 170 basis points to 13.8%.
Cost of services fell 240 basis points to 56.7% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 versus 59.1% in the second quarter of 2011. This reduction was primarily driven by the fact that all costs associated with ING REIM, which were not present in the second quarter of 2011, drove through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services. Despite the inclusion of all of ING REIM’s costs in operating expenses, this line was essentially flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the second quarter of 2011, indicating effective cost management.
In the Americas and Asia-Pacific consistent with historical patterns, positive operating leverage was readily apparent. Due to the more fixed nature of costs in many parts of Europe and the rapid declining leasing revenues in EMEA during the quarter such operating leverage was not yet as evident in this region.
Interest expense increased by $10.2 million in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the full impact from the financing of ING REIM and the Sterling denominated term loan A1 facility that we were not present in the second quarter of 2011.
Our second quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 40% and we expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be a little below this. Second quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.23 versus $0.19 last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.27 versus $0.21 in the second quarter of 2011 an increase of almost 30%.
Please turn to Slide 7. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the second quarter of 2012 representing 34% of total revenue in the quarter with a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.
Leasing was our second largest service line representing 30% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 with increases in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.
Investment sales accelerated to a growth rate of 16% in the second quarter of 2012 driven by the Americas, with positive contributions from EMEA and Asia-Pacific as well. It represented 16% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2012.
Global investment and management revenue more than doubled again quarter-over-quarter driven by increases in asset management fees attributable to the ING REIM businesses.
Appraisal and valuation revenue increased 6% to $95.2 million led by a business in Asia-Pacific that was acquired late in the second quarter of 2011.
Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue grew 36% year-over-year driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors’ continued search for yield.
Development services revenue was up slightly to $15.5 million.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 57% of total revenue for the second quarter of 2012.
Although not our typical sequence, I will briefly cover our debt maturity and capitalization table before handing the call over to Bob. Slide 8 shows the amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. This is virtually unchanged from the first quarter of 2012. With considerable liquidity and cash flow, we remain very comfortable with our debt maturity schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to Slide 9. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities, not available for company use and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and our mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the second quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.9 billion. This is flat as compared to the end of first quarter of 2012 and up versus the end of 2011 due to bonuses and other incentive compensation payments made in the first half of the year. Consistent with historical trends, our net debt is expected to decrease as the year progresses.
At the end of the second quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.7% when including interest rate swaps, similar to the end of the first quarter of 2012. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.76x at the end of the second quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12 month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA stood at 2.19x. I will now turn the call over to Bob who will cover business line performance."

Please turn to Slide 10. Our outsourcing business continued its pattern of consistent growth driven by record new account additions. In the second quarter of this year, we",1428,"Thanks Gill, I am glad to once again to be joining these calls on a regular basis. Please turn to Slide 10. Our outsourcing business continued its pattern of consistent growth driven by record new account additions. In the second quarter of this year, we signed 54 contracts, the second highest total in company history.
We landed 24 new accounts, the most ever for a single quarter, 21 renewals and 9 expansions. All of this contract activity in the second quarter and for many prior quarters suggests very strong underlying momentum in our outsourcing business and we expect that momentum to continue well into the future.
The outsourcing trend is being propelled by globalization and the desire by occupiers of all sizes and across industries to increase efficiency and improve all overall performance particularly in light of the global economic slowdown. For this reason, this business has significant headroom for growth. We believe there is as much as $50 billion to $60 billion in total market potential.
We are poised to capture a significant percentage in this opportunity by delivering services to more space users in established outsourcing markets as well as newer markets. For example, we see big potential among mid-cap companies which accounted for more than a third of our total contracts in the second quarter.
We also continue to add customers in the government and healthcare sectors where cost pressures are especially acute. We saw evidence of this in the second quarter with 3 new contracts in the government sector and 3 new contracts plus a client expansion in the healthcare sector.
In addition, 4 large corporations selected us to provide various services to their properties in Latin America and we were hired by Sony to handle transaction management and lease administration in Asia Pacific and EMEA.
Please turn to Slide 11, which demonstrates steadily decreasing vacancy rates and positive absorption in all 3 market sectors depicted along with forecasted improvement over the next 2 years. Average national cap rates were slightly down in the second quarter versus both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year, primarily due to continued strength in core and Class A property sales.
Please turn to Slide 12. The Americas posted very good growth in property sales revenue in the second quarter which continued to be driven by activity in core markets with modest improvement in secondary markets.
Our position as a market leader across asset sectors, office, industrial, retail and multifamily and our ability to provide integrated equity and debt solutions are clearly a distinct advantage. Our CA data shows that we improved market share by 230 basis points from a year ago to 16.2% in the second quarter of this year, once again the highest in the industry.
Leasing markets generally showed some improvement in the second quarter with vacancy rates declining modestly. During the quarter, the US office vacancy rate fell 30 basis points to 15.7% compared to the first quarter of this year, indicating that our office market recovery remains intact. Market fundamentals continue to be helped by very low levels of new construction. Occupier demand, however, remains modest. In light of this, second quarter leasing revenue increase of 5% is a good result and in line with our expectations.
This growth reflects our premier position in key business centers such as New York City, where we negotiated 4 of the 5 largest leased transactions in the first half of this year. Our Americas outsourcing business grew by a strong 13% in the second quarter.
Please turn to Slide 13. In EMEA, property sales provided a positive surprise, despite almost daily headlines about the Euro Zone debt crisis and heightened investor anxiety. Our EMEA sales revenue rose 3% in the second quarter, excluding the notable impact of negative foreign currency movement. EMEA sales revenue grew by 11%.
We’re especially pleased with this outcome given that property sales activity across most of the EMEA is weak. Recent performance showed greater effects from the flat lining economies across Europe. While average rents across the region have remained relatively stable, occupiers have been hesitant to make commitments in the current environment.
As a result, EMEA leasing revenue decreased 17% in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same quarter in 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, leasing declined 10% in the second quarter versus second quarter last year.
Consistent with our first quarter results, France in particular had a very negative comparison against a strong second quarter in 2011. EMEA outsourcing revenue was flat in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by negative foreign currency movements excluding the impact of foreign currency outsourcing revenue grew 9%. Our total revenue in EMEA declined 5%. However, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange it grew 3%.
Please turn to Slide 14. Asia-Pacific generated solid growth in all 3 major business lines during the second quarter. We saw excellent performance in Japan as the economy there continued to recover from last year’s natural disaster and the related investment in infrastructure continued.
Investors increasingly proceed towards Japan as a safe heaven and a near integral part of any overall Asia investment strategy. Australia, India and Singapore all performed well despite moderating global economic activity. Property sales revenue advanced 4% in the second quarter led by activity in Japan, excluding the impact of negative foreign currency movements, the increase was 8%.
Leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 6% with growth evident in almost all geographies excluding the impact of foreign exchange growth was 9%. Outsourcing revenue improved by 5% in the second quarter versus the second quarter last year and excluding the impact of foreign exchange outsourcing revenue grew 13%. Our total revenue growth in Asia Pacific was 11% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Please turn to Slide 15. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $17.8 million in the second quarter versus $17.2 million in the second quarter last year. Second quarter EBITDA declined by $6.6 million from the second quarter of last year due to higher profits from property sales in the prior year quarter. At the end of the second quarter, in process development totaled $4.7 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.4 billion. Our equity core investments at the end of the second quarter in development services totaled $89.2 million and our recourse debt stood at only $15 million.
Please turn to Slide 16. Second quarter 2012 global investment management revenue increased $119.7 million from $58.9 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees largely stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM which contributed approximately $7 million revenue in the second quarter.
Assets under management, or AUM, totaled $91.2 billion at the end of the second quarter down from $95.9 billion at the end of the first quarter this year. $2.8 billion of the drop was due to a non-traded REIT’s board's decision to internalize its management. In addition, AUM declined in the current quarter by $1.8 billion due to currency fluctuations and $500 million due to declines in asset values primarily in Europe and $400 million due to dispositions while acquisitions added $800 million to our assets under the management. 
Included in the $91.2 billion of AUM at the end of the second quarter was $21.4 billion of listed securities. Net outflows combined with changes in market valuation in this portfolio decreased AUM by $300 million dollars versus the end of first quarter.
During the second quarter of this year, we raised new equity capital of approximately $700 million in the direct real estate business, and had approximately $2.6 billion of equity capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our co-investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $215.1 million.
Please turn to Slide 17. Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation is shown here. In the second quarter of 2012, we incurred $9.1 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisition primarily for retention, severance, facilities and information technology.
As of June 30th this year, the company maintained accumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $40 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This reflects a reduction of $4 million from the end of the first quarter due to new income tax related distribution. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 25% for the second quarter of 2012.
Brett, I will now turn the call back over to you."

The commercial real estate recovery continues to progress at a historically slow pace relative to prior recoveries with a high degree of inconsistency globally. We are pleased that CBRE continues to perform well and we continue to build our position as a market leader
Our views following the completion of the first half of 2012 are that outsourcing is expected to continue its strong consistent growth trend, leasing growth rates should be relatively modest, investment sales growth will vary widely depending on local and regional market dynamics and finally that investment management will benefit from a full year contribution from the acquired ING REIM businesses.
With the first half now behind us, we remain comfortable with our full year normalized EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 with higher normalized EBITDA margins than in 2011. However given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the global economic picture, we will take a close look at our guidance again at the conclusion of the third quarter which of course is our standard practice.
And with that operator, we’ll take now questions."

The first is the market is clearly expanding more quickly or has been expanding more quickly the last 3, 4 years than it has in prior years.
So the business is maturing and more and more firms are coming to market with outsourcing contracts. The second dynamic though that greatly supports our firm is the movement of outsourcing work away from niche, boutique and regional players over to true global firms, and so that trend which has been extant for quite some time, as you know Anthony, is a big benefiting dynamic to ourselves and to one other firm in the industry."

There seems to be a new issue as you know Anthony, in Europe, every week, every month.
So the market place in Europe is troubled and when you have a market place like that, what tends to happen is people freeze on making decisions around dispositions of real estate, acquisitions of real estate, expanding their business' footprint, contracting their business' footprint. Everybody takes a time-out until they can digest what is going on in their market place and this market is -- Europe market is very dynamic.
I don't think anybody in Europe at the moment, we certainly can’t, predict with any uncertainty what that marketplace is going to look like a month from now, much less a year from now and until that sort of view is available in the marketplace, until large customers of ours can look forward for a few quarters and have some comfort around what that marketplace is going to be bring them, this market is going to remain troubled as you saw in the leasing volumes and you saw in the sales volumes.

I think that’s a very good description of what’s going on. Obviously we saw a different circumstance with investment properties than we did with leasing in the last quarter and I think the explanation for that is in core markets and there certainly are some important core markets there, most notably London.
People are going to invest in real estate because they think they can get some yield. It’s so hard to get yield on anything you invest in today that there is going to be investment in core solid properties and we saw some of that. The flip side is for leasing, businesses simply aren’t going to make decisions with this much uncertainty and we saw real pressure in the leasing market.

The length of lease in the second quarter was basically flat. They were both actually down 1%.
But the average lease size was actually up 5% for the quarter, so those 3 dynamics which are the dynamics to give us revenue gives a 7% increase from reported leasing revenue for all product types in the second quarter of 2012 versus second quarter of 2011.

When we talk about taking material cost out, we'll talk about that when we are going to do something that likely will fall in to restructuring charge and there is nothing going on in the business right now, that would lead us to talk about that at the moment.
But we are watching EMEA carefully obviously as you know, David but I'll look at the other callers know as well, the cost structures in Europe are different than the Americas and Asia Pacific, and a lot of the cost that you have underpinning your business in Europe is more structural than it is variable and it’s harder to get out in this another market.
So what tends to happen is you lag a bit in Europe on the cost side and I think the underscoring point that is important for our callers to understand is that as you saw in our performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year, we are paying a lot of attention to cost. And we are going to continue to pay a lot of attention to cost until these markets are stabilized and growing at a rate that we think indicates a good recovery.

That's just not as easy to do in Europe. But again, as we mentioned in our script earlier, one of the great benefits of this firm is that we are so highly diversified, our own product line. We have so many businesses that we benefit from that the firm can absorb issues like Europe right now and still post industry-leading margins and industry-leading profits. That's by design and that allows us to be patient with Europe, not to make draconian cuts to their cost structure because our Europe business is a terrific business and we are very comfortable with where they stand at the moment on their cost side, although we are concerned as Gill said on the revenue side."

They were gains that certainly were normal course for development, but then there were those that were outsized.
And so my comments were around the fact that in the principal businesses, whatever upside there was from investment management, which at the EPS line remember is reduced by things like interest expense, amortization that doesn’t get normalized and so forth. When you looked at the net income or EPS line, whatever favorability we had would more or less be offset by absence of development gains.
And so that's how I think you ought to -- at this point, I still would affirm that's how you ought to think about the fourth quarter and the year, so that the upside and the expansion in margin will come from the services business which is exactly how we framed it up when we gave the outlook at the beginning of the year."

I am happy to have Bob joining our call today. Bob’s well known to most of you. I know you will enjoy interacting with him more regularly as he gears to assume the CEO duty at the end of the year.
We are very pleased with our results for the quarter. We grew our top line by double-digits, improved our bottom line by nearly 30% and increased our normalized EBITDA margin by 170 basis points. Our strong performance reflects a broad well balanced global platform we have built over 2 decades, one in which strength in certain business lines and markets compensates for weaknesses in others. It also demonstrates our ability to control costs while executing on our growth strategy.
Right now the Americas is faring the best of all our region. Our permanent position in markets across the U.S. Canada and Latin America has enabled us to sustain double-digit revenue and profit growth despite the lack of meaningful job creation. Asia-Pacific achieved solid growth in the second quarter as well, notwithstanding China’s economic slowdown. As expected, EMEA saw softer results as it continued to fight formidable headwinds related to both the Euro zone’s ongoing economic and debt issues and notable negative currency effects.
Benefits continue to accrue from our acquisition of the ING REIM businesses last year. We believe that the blending of ING REIM’s professional talent with our own has forged a new industry leader in real estate investment management and have certainly given us an enhanced stream of stable revenue at higher margins than most of our other businesses.
The 25% normalized EBITDA margin that this business achieved during the quarter served us particularly well in a choppy market environment and we expect the positive contributions from the ING REIM acquisition to continue.
Our global outsourcing business continued to make strong gains with double-digit revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. We signed 54 total contracts including 24 with new outsourcing customers, setting a company record for new wins in a quarter. This business continues to exhibit good momentum for reasons we will discuss later.
Our capital markets business has also performed well. Although a small component of total company revenue, mortgage brokerage had robust revenue growth of 36% as loan origination volumes and related servicing demand continued to rise.
While still a relatively moderate portion of overall revenue, property sales moved higher in all regions paced by the Americas, reflecting generally soft occupier market condition particular in Europe, property leasing edged up slightly on a global basis. The Americas and Asia-Pacific accounted for the increase.
While the global market recovery progresses, macro challenges continue to limit its strength. Nonetheless, CBRE continues to be in an advantageous position. Our unique combination of people, brand and mature global platform gives us the ability to perform well for clients and shareholders and to build market share across our spectrum of services.
Shown here on Slide 5, our noble transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter. As usual, I'll not go through them individually, but we've included them for your review.
And with that, Gil, I'll turn the call over to you to go through the financial deck."

Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2012, up 12% from last year or 13% when excluding discontinued operations. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, investment sales, investment management and commercial mortgage brokerage.
Normalized EBITDA improved at more than twice the pace of revenue, rising 28% to $220.9 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $172.4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and our normalized EBITDA margin expanded by 170 basis points to 13.8%.
Cost of services fell 240 basis points to 56.7% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 versus 59.1% in the second quarter of 2011. This reduction was primarily driven by the fact that all costs associated with ING REIM, which were not present in the second quarter of 2011, drove through the operating expense line as opposed to cost of services. Despite the inclusion of all of ING REIM’s costs in operating expenses, this line was essentially flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the second quarter of 2011, indicating effective cost management.
In the Americas and Asia-Pacific consistent with historical patterns, positive operating leverage was readily apparent. Due to the more fixed nature of costs in many parts of Europe and the rapid declining leasing revenues in EMEA during the quarter such operating leverage was not yet as evident in this region.
Interest expense increased by $10.2 million in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the full impact from the financing of ING REIM and the Sterling denominated term loan A1 facility that we were not present in the second quarter of 2011.
Our second quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 40% and we expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be a little below this. Second quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.23 versus $0.19 last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.27 versus $0.21 in the second quarter of 2011 an increase of almost 30%.
Please turn to Slide 7. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the second quarter of 2012 representing 34% of total revenue in the quarter with a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.
Leasing was our second largest service line representing 30% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 with increases in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.
Investment sales accelerated to a growth rate of 16% in the second quarter of 2012 driven by the Americas, with positive contributions from EMEA and Asia-Pacific as well. It represented 16% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2012.
Global investment and management revenue more than doubled again quarter-over-quarter driven by increases in asset management fees attributable to the ING REIM businesses.
Appraisal and valuation revenue increased 6% to $95.2 million led by a business in Asia-Pacific that was acquired late in the second quarter of 2011.
Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue grew 36% year-over-year driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors’ continued search for yield.
Development services revenue was up slightly to $15.5 million.
Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 57% of total revenue for the second quarter of 2012.
Although not our typical sequence, I will briefly cover our debt maturity and capitalization table before handing the call over to Bob. Slide 8 shows the amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. This is virtually unchanged from the first quarter of 2012. With considerable liquidity and cash flow, we remain very comfortable with our debt maturity schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to Slide 9. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities, not available for company use and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and our mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the second quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.9 billion. This is flat as compared to the end of first quarter of 2012 and up versus the end of 2011 due to bonuses and other incentive compensation payments made in the first half of the year. Consistent with historical trends, our net debt is expected to decrease as the year progresses.
At the end of the second quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.7% when including interest rate swaps, similar to the end of the first quarter of 2012. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.76x at the end of the second quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12 month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA stood at 2.19x. I will now turn the call over to Bob who will cover business line performance."

All of this contract activity in the second quarter and for many prior quarters suggests very strong underlying momentum in our outsourcing business and we expect that momentum to continue well into the future.
The outsourcing trend is being propelled by globalization and the desire by occupiers of all sizes and across industries to increase efficiency and improve all overall performance particularly in light of the global economic slowdown. For this reason, this business has significant headroom for growth. We believe there is as much as $50 billion to $60 billion in total market potential.
We are poised to capture a significant percentage in this opportunity by delivering services to more space users in established outsourcing markets as well as newer markets. For example, we see big potential among mid-cap companies which accounted for more than a third of our total contracts in the second quarter.
We also continue to add customers in the government and healthcare sectors where cost pressures are especially acute. We saw evidence of this in the second quarter with 3 new contracts in the government sector and 3 new contracts plus a client expansion in the healthcare sector.
In addition, 4 large corporations selected us to provide various services to their properties in Latin America and we were hired by Sony to handle transaction management and lease administration in Asia Pacific and EMEA.
Please turn to Slide 11, which demonstrates steadily decreasing vacancy rates and positive absorption in all 3 market sectors depicted along with forecasted improvement over the next 2 years. Average national cap rates were slightly down in the second quarter versus both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year, primarily due to continued strength in core and Class A property sales.
Please turn to Slide 12. The Americas posted very good growth in property sales revenue in the second quarter which continued to be driven by activity in core markets with modest improvement in secondary markets.
Our position as a market leader across asset sectors, office, industrial, retail and multifamily and our ability to provide integrated equity and debt solutions are clearly a distinct advantage. Our CA data shows that we improved market share by 230 basis points from a year ago to 16.2% in the second quarter of this year, once again the highest in the industry.
Leasing markets generally showed some improvement in the second quarter with vacancy rates declining modestly. During the quarter, the U.S. office vacancy rate fell 30 basis points to 15.7% compared to the first quarter of this year, indicating that our office market recovery remains intact. Market fundamentals continue to be helped by very low levels of new construction. Occupier demand, however, remains modest. In light of this, second quarter leasing revenue increase of 5% is a good result and in line with our expectations.
This growth reflects our premier position in key business centers such as New York City, where we negotiated 4 of the 5 largest leased transactions in the first half of this year. Our Americas outsourcing business grew by a strong 13% in the second quarter.
Please turn to Slide 13. In EMEA, property sales provided a positive surprise, despite almost daily headlines about the Euro Zone debt crisis and heightened investor anxiety. Our EMEA sales revenue rose 3% in the second quarter, excluding the notable impact of negative foreign currency movement. EMEA sales revenue grew by 11%.
We’re especially pleased with this outcome given that property sales activity across most of the EMEA is weak. Recent performance showed greater effects from the flat lining economies across Europe. While average rents across the region have remained relatively stable, occupiers have been hesitant to make commitments in the current environment.
As a result, EMEA leasing revenue decreased 17% in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same quarter in 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, leasing declined 10% in the second quarter versus second quarter last year.
Consistent with our first quarter results, France in particular had a very negative comparison against a strong second quarter in 2011. EMEA outsourcing revenue was flat in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by negative foreign currency movements excluding the impact of foreign currency outsourcing revenue grew 9%. Our total revenue in EMEA declined 5%. However, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange it grew 3%.
Please turn to Slide 14. Asia-Pacific generated solid growth in all 3 major business lines during the second quarter. We saw excellent performance in Japan as the economy there continued to recover from last year’s natural disaster and the related investment in infrastructure continued.
Investors increasingly proceed towards Japan as a safe heaven and a near integral part of any overall Asia investment strategy. Australia, India and Singapore all performed well despite moderating global economic activity. Property sales revenue advanced 4% in the second quarter led by activity in Japan, excluding the impact of negative foreign currency movements, the increase was 8%.
Leasing revenue in Asia Pacific grew 6% with growth evident in almost all geographies excluding the impact of foreign exchange growth was 9%. Outsourcing revenue improved by 5% in the second quarter versus the second quarter last year and excluding the impact of foreign exchange outsourcing revenue grew 13%. Our total revenue growth in Asia Pacific was 11% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Please turn to Slide 15. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $17.8 million in the second quarter versus $17.2 million in the second quarter last year. Second quarter EBITDA declined by $6.6 million from the second quarter of last year due to higher profits from property sales in the prior year quarter. At the end of the second quarter, in process development totaled $4.7 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.4 billion. Our equity core investments at the end of the second quarter in development services totaled $89.2 million and our recourse debt stood at only $15 million.
Please turn to Slide 16. Second quarter 2012 global investment management revenue increased $119.7 million from $58.9 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees largely stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM which contributed approximately $7 million revenue in the second quarter.
Assets under management, or AUM, totaled $91.2 billion at the end of the second quarter down from $95.9 billion at the end of the first quarter this year. $2.8 billion of the drop was due to a non-traded REIT’s board's decision to internalize its management. In addition, AUM declined in the current quarter by $1.8 billion due to currency fluctuations and $500 million due to declines in asset values primarily in Europe and $400 million due to dispositions while acquisitions added $800 million to our assets under the management. 
Included in the $91.2 billion of AUM at the end of the second quarter was $21.4 billion of listed securities. Net outflows combined with changes in market valuation in this portfolio decreased AUM by $300 million dollars versus the end of first quarter.
During the second quarter of this year, we raised new equity capital of approximately $700 million in the direct real estate business, and had approximately $2.6 billion of equity capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our co-investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $215.1 million.
Please turn to Slide 17. Our global investment management EBITDA reconciliation is shown here. In the second quarter of 2012, we incurred $9.1 million of expenses related to the ING REIM acquisition primarily for retention, severance, facilities and information technology.
As of June 30th this year, the company maintained accumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $40 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This reflects a reduction of $4 million from the end of the first quarter due to new income tax related distribution. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 25% for the second quarter of 2012.
Brett, I will now turn the call back over to you."

The commercial real estate recovery continues to progress at a historically slow pace relative to prior recoveries with a high degree of inconsistency globally. We are pleased that CBRE continues to perform well and we continue to build our position as a market leader
Our views following the completion of the first half of 2012 are that outsourcing is expected to continue its strong consistent growth trend, leasing growth rates should be relatively modest, investment sales growth will vary widely depending on local and regional market dynamics and finally that investment management will benefit from a full year contribution from the acquired ING REIM businesses.
With the first half now behind us, we remain comfortable with our full year normalized EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 with higher normalized EBITDA margins than in 2011. However given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the global economic picture, we will take a close look at our guidance again at the conclusion of the third quarter which of course is our standard practice.
And with that operator, we’ll take now questions."

So the business is maturing and more and more firms are coming to market with outsourcing contracts.

So the market place in Europe is troubled and when you have a market place like that, what tends to happen is people freeze on making decisions around dispositions of real estate, acquisitions of real estate, expanding their business' footprint, contracting their business' footprint. Everybody takes a time-out until they can digest what is going on in their market place and this market is -- Europe market is very dynamic. I don't think anybody in Europe at the moment, we certainly can’t, predict with any uncertainty what that marketplace is going to look like a month from now, much less a year from now and until that sort of view is available in the marketplace, until large customers of ours can look forward for a few quarters and have some comfort around what that marketplace is going to be bring them, this market is going to remain troubled as you saw in the leasing volumes and you saw in the sales volumes.

Obviously we saw a different circumstance with investment properties than we did with leasing in the last quarter and I think the explanation for that is in core markets and there certainly are some important core markets there, most notably London.

It’s so hard to get yield on anything you invest in today that there is going to be investment in core solid properties and we saw some of that.

But we are watching EMEA carefully obviously, as you know, David, but I'll look at the other callers know as well, the cost structures in Europe are different than the Americas and Asia Pacific, and a lot of the cost that you have underpinning your business in Europe is more structural than it is variable and it’s harder to get out in this another market. So what tends to happen is you lag a bit in Europe on the cost side and I think the underscoring point that is important for our callers to understand is that as you saw in our performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year, we are paying a lot of attention to cost.

That's just not as easy to do in Europe. But again, as we mentioned in our script earlier, one of the great benefits of this firm is that we are so highly diversified, our own product line. We have so many businesses that we benefit from that the firm can absorb issues like Europe right now and still post industry-leading margins and industry-leading profits. That's by design and that allows us to be patient with Europe, not to make draconian cuts to their cost structure because our Europe business is a terrific business and we are very comfortable with where they stand at the moment on their cost side, although we are concerned as Gil said on the revenue side."

They were gains that certainly were normal course for development, but then there were those that were outsized. And so my comments were around the fact that in the principal businesses, whatever upside there was from investment management, which at the EPS line remember is reduced by things like interest expense, amortization that doesn’t get normalized and so forth. When you looked at the net income or EPS line, whatever favorability we had would more or less be offset by absence of development gains. And so that's how I think you ought to -- at this point, I still would affirm that's how you ought to think about the fourth quarter and the year, so that the upside and the expansion in margin will come from the services business which is exactly how we framed it up when we gave the outlook at the beginning of the year."

As you know, the market environment turned more cautious in the third quarter of this year. Many investors and occupiers deferred making decisions and commitments, concerns about ongoing European sovereign debt issues and slowing growth in Asia, which have been vain on the markets most of the year were joined by heightened uncertainty starting from lower corporate profit expectations, as well as the upcoming U.S. election and so called fiscal cliff.
The increase caution was manifested in lower business volumes, particularly sale and lease transactions. In most of our geographies, also across EMEA, this was also the case in all other significant service lines.
Despite this very challenging macro conditions we were nevertheless able to improve revenue, while holding operating expenses flat exclusive of cost containment expenses, thereby supporting normalized EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, and preserving our industry-leading margins. This of course is a credit to our people and our broad diverse global platform.
We’ve worked hard over a number of years to build a well-balanced integrated platform to meet the needs of our clients. The benefits of these efforts will vary evident in the third quarter of this year.
Our acquisition of the ING REIM business has added significant and largely recurring fee based revenue to our Global Investment Management operations. As a result, this segment saw revenue grow sharply and its contribution to total company normalized EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2011 increased significantly.
We’re quite pleased with the 32% normalized EBITDA margin, this business delivered in the third quarter, and we believe it is indicative of where it can perform on a consistent basis.
Outsourcing continue to grow solidly with revenue up 7% globally or 11% in local currency and 13% in the Americas. Steady adoption of outsourcing continues and CBRE remains well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
We signed 67 total contracts in the third quarter, our highest total ever for one quarter, including 25 with new customers and 16 contract expansions, also single quarter company records.
Despite the slowdown in global investment sales, our mortgage brokerage business posted a double-digit revenue increase, driven by our deep and strong position in the U.S. multi-family finance market. These two business lines outsourcing and mortgage brokerage were the biggest growth drivers in our Americas operations.
While the property sales market was soft, we were able to expand the gap between ourselves and the number two firm in the world’s two largest investment markets which are drawing global capital through their status as relative safe-haven namely, the United States and United Kingdom.
The current recovery unlike previous ones remains frustratingly slow and inconsistent. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the recoveries are ongoing and as we’ve been saying for some time remain subject to quick swings in market sentiment as we saw in the third quarter.
We do expect the solid finish to the year in light of current business pipeline and as always, we cautioned against judging the underlying trends in our business based on a 90-day timeframe.
Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on slide five. As usual, I’ll not go through them individually, but we’ve included them for your review.
And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Gil to discuss our overall performance.

Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2012, up 1% from last year or 5% in local currency. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, Investment Management and Commercial Mortgage Brokerage.
We recorded normalized EBITDA of $195.3 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $194.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 for a normalized EBITDA margin of 12.5% close to our 12.7% EBITDA margin achieved last year.
Cost of services increase 50 basis points to 58.8% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012 versus 58.3% in the third quarter of 2011. This increase was driven by cost containment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2012 and the decline in transaction revenues in certain geographies that has significant fix cost compensation structure.
Despite the inclusion of all of the ING REIM costs in the operating expense line item and cost containment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2012. Operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter increased by just 40 basis points from 30.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011 to 31% of revenue in the third quarter of 2012.
In light of lower business volumes in EMEA in the first six months of the year and our expectations for the second half of the year. We took further cost contain actions in this region, primarily headcount reductions that resulted in a charge of approximately $16 million.
This charge, as well as a charge of approximately $2 million for cost containment actions in Japan has been normalize and should result in savings of approximately $10 million on a run rate basis for 2013 and beyond.
Furthermore, revert of the value of the trade name in the United Kingdom that is no longer being broadly utilized. The non-cash write-off of this intangible asset was approximately $20 million and was also normalized.
Interest expense increased by $4.6 million in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the full impact from the financing of ING REIM acquisitions and the sterling denominated term loan A1 facility that was entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our third quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 31%. This was primarily driven by the benefits derive from a legal reorganization of certain entities in Asia-Pacific that was largely discreet to the quarter.
We are continuing to focus on the tax efficiency of legal entity and operating structure. For these reasons we now anticipate a tax rate of approximately 35% for the full year 2012.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.8 million in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to depreciation on recent increase IT-related capital expenditures and higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the ING REIM acquisitions.
Third quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.12 versus $0.20 last year. While our normalized EBITDA in the third quarter of 2012 was comparable to the prior year quarter, the combination of increased interest, depreciation and amortization expense was more than offset by a lower tax provision that reduced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.26 in the third quarter of 2012, which was up 8% as compared to $0.24 in the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to slide seven. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the third quarter of 2012, representing 36% of total revenue in the quarter with a 7% increase or 11% in local currency over the third quarter of 2011.
Leasing remained our second largest service line, representing 29% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012, but experienced softness globally as compared to the third quarter of 2011, mostly due to increased uncertainty.
Investment sales slowed by 7% or 4% in local currency in the third quarter of 2012, with weakness also felt globally as investors grew more hesitant to deploy capital.
Global investment management revenue increased 54% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in asset management fees attributable to the ING REIM businesses.
Appraisal and valuation revenue remained flat in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors continued search for yield.
It should be noted that this is primarily U.S.-based business where investment activity and sentiment, particularly in the multi-family sector remain stronger than in other parts of the world.
Development services revenue was down slightly to $15.9 million. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 62% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2012.
Please turn to slide eight. Our outsourcing business continued its pattern of consistent growth, driven by record total contracts signed and new account additions, particularly in the Americas.
In the third quarter of 2012, we signed 67 contracts, once again, a new record total in company history. We closed 25 new accounts, the most ever for actually in a single quarter, 26 renewals and 16 expansions also a quarterly company record.
In sectors that we see as particularly promising for growth, the company was awarded six new contracts and two expansions in the healthcare and government verticals. Reflecting the increase globalization of outsourcing, the company was awarded two new contracts in the EMEA and won two new contracts in secured three client expansions in Asia-Pacific.
As we have previously noted, we believe the total available market for this business is $50 billion to $60 billion. We continue to make good progress on capturing new business and feel confident about our continued global prospects for this business.
Please turn to slide nine. This slide demonstrates steadily decreasing vacancy rates and positive absorption in all three market sectors depicted, along with forecasted improvement over the next year.
Average national cap rates were stable in the third quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2012 and slightly down as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to continued strength in core property sales.
Please turn to slide 10. The Americas region showed moderate revenue growth in the aggregate driven by outsourcing. Investment sales revenue in the Americas declined by 5% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011, as investors grew more cautious about deploying capital.
CBRE once again held the number one position in the U.S. investment market for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Despite the weakness in leasing activity this quarter, the incremental office market recovery continued as the vacancy rate fell by 20 basis points to 15.5%.
Over the past year, the office vacancy rate declined by 70 basis points, indicating that the recovery is continuing in spite of the domestic and global economic headwinds. Americas outsourcing revenue grew by a strong 13% in the third quarter of 2012.
Please turn to slide 11. Our total revenue in EMEA declined 17%. However, when excluding the impact of foreign currency, it was down 9%. The lack of global economic growth for the region also resulted in a 17% drop in investment sales revenue in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, investment sales revenue declined 10%. The drop was driven by weakness in France and Germany. However, the United Kingdom showed strong growth as a result of the ongoing desirability of London-based prime assets. We were pleased to see that our share of United Kingdom investment sales activity nearly doubled compared to a year ago, based on information from property data.
Leasing revenue declined 24% quarter-over-quarter, illustrating the impact of economic uncertainty on occupied sentiment and the resulting caution with which they took new space and made long-term commitments.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, leasing revenue declined 18%. As with sales activity, France and Germany were particularly weak in the third quarter of 2012.
The EMEA outsourcing revenue decreased 12% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, outsourcing revenue was down only 2%, primarily due to reduced project management work versus a year ago.
Please turn to slide 12. Our total revenue in Asia-Pacific was down 4% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. But when excluding the impact of foreign currency, it was up 2%.
While the U.S. owned debt prices and sluggish U.S. growth have hampered economic activity in Asia-Pacific all year. The decline in the rate of economic growth in China, as well as other countries in the region caused investors and occupiers to be more cautious in the third quarter of 2012.
Property sales revenue declined 6% in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, investment sales revenue declined by 2%. Leasing revenue in Asia-Pacific declined 12% and excluding the impact of foreign currency the decline was 9%.

Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter 2012 Global Investment Management revenue increased to $114.3 million from $77.4 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees, stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM Europe and Asia, which contributed approximately $46 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2012.
It should be noted that the global real estate securities component of the business was acquired from ING on July 1, 2011, and is therefore fully included in both the current and prior quarters.
Assets under management or AUM, totaled $90.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012, down $800 million from the second quarter of 2012. This was comprised increases of $1 billion from acquisitions, $500 million from asset value changes and $1 billion due to positive currency fluctuations, more than offset by dispositions and transfers of $3.3 billion.
Included in the $90.4 billion in AUM at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was $22.2 billion of listed securities. This represents an increase of $800 million from the second quarter of 2012, which resulted primarily from value appreciation in this portfolio.
During the third quarter of 2012, we raised new equity capital of approximately $1.5 billion in the direct real estate business and had approximately $3.5 billion of equity capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $216.8 million.
Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on slide 15. In the third quarter of 2012, we incurred $14.2 million of expenses related to ING REIM acquisitions, primarily for retention, severance, facilities and information technology.

This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 34% for the third quarter of 2012.
Slide 16 shows our liquidity position at September 30, 2012 as well as our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. The latter is virtually unchanged from the second quarter of 2012. With considerable liquidity and cash flow, we remain very comfortable with our debt maturity schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to slide 17. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use, and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and our mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.8 billion, while up by $117 million from year end 2011, net debt is down by almost $110 million from the second quarter of 2012 in line with seasonal patterns. Consistent with historical trends, our net debt is expected to decrease further in the fourth quarter of 2012.
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.6%, similar to the end of the second quarter of 2012, when including interest rate swaps. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.74 times at the end of the third quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA stood at 2.1 times.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett.

We believe that the commercial real estate recovery is continuing despite the soft patch particularly in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2012. If nothing else, the third quarter is a reminder that variable market conditions will be the norm until global economic growth and job creation shift in the higher gear.
In the interim, we expect outsourcing to continue with solid consistent growth, leasing to remain relatively subdued reflecting slower global economic and employment growth trends. Investments sales activity vary widely depending on local and regional market dynamics and investor sentiments which as we have seen can change quickly.
Investment Management comparisons will benefit less from the ING REIM businesses in Q4, relatively to the first nine months of 2012, and full-year 2012 normalized EBITDA margins to improve. We expect conditions in Europe to remain soft until the sovereign debt challenges in Southern Europe are dealt with decisively and in Asia until more steady economic growth returns.
In the U.S., the two big uncertainties namely the presidential election and the fiscal cliff will be resolved one way or another shortly. This resolution will be in greater certainty to the market.
Meanwhile, underlined markets fundamentals continue to improve incrementally. Our business pipelines are healthy and our people around the world are energized to help our clients navigate the choppy environment. CBRE remains well positioned for this market climate because of the strength, the geographic scope and the diversity of our platform.
Our strong financial position and the quality of our brand and people which assure clients they are also receiving the best advice. In light of the operating performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect full-year 2012 adjusted earning per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20.
Notwithstanding current economy conditions, CBRE remains strongly position to thrive in a month and years ahead. To hear more about our long-term strategy, I hope you’ll be able to attend our Business Review Day this year.
Bob Sulentic will be hosting event which will take place in the morning of Thursday, December 6th at our New York City office at 200 Park.
With that, operator we’ll now take questions.

We’ve got that cash of $700 million, $450 million available -- would be available in the U.S., around $250 million plus overseas. And we’re always anticipating what our options are with that cash.
The one thing that I can say definitively and that I think I’ve said before is we do have a high-yield bonds coming due in June of next year, the 11.625. At least, there is a call on them. And whether we refinance those or partially finance those and partially use cash is yet to be determined, but you can certainly think about that in terms of an interest expense reduction, certainly for the back half of next year and the full year of 2013, if current interest rates and the current interest rate environment remains low.
So there is no specific M&A. There is no specific opportunities for cash that you wouldn’t normally think of, we’ve obviously got our core investment program in the principle businesses.

You’re starting to see the beginnings of all the benefits of our work in this area. And there will be benefit next year, but in terms of how much I’m not ready to talk about that quite yet, David.

First thing I would say is that EMEA has been a soft story for a lot longer than the third quarter. Third quarter was just another chapter and what seems to be a fairly long book now on difficult market conditions.
I will say and we referenced in our comments that, that being said, EMEA as well as our other global businesses feels pretty good about their fourth quarter and the pipelines that they have. But nonetheless, as we said on the call, until we see -- really I think this way, until there is confidence in the Europe across continental Europe, I think EMEA is going to be feelings from pain. Bob, do you want to add some color to that?

As we look at the third quarter in EMEA, we didn’t differentiate one-time period within the quarter versus another, as being a driver in the outcome. It was all a pretty rough time. What was more important from us is to makeup of our business, the geographic makeup of our business.
We have a particularly large business in France, which had a very good year last year and has suffered a big time this year as a marketplace. In addition to that, it just so happens, France has also had very tough compare on FX, as you know and foreign exchange. So, the combination of the size of our business, the decline of that business in that marketplace in France, the FX circumstance with the euro has made for a very tough quarter in the third quarter in Europe.
And it was more about that from our perspective than it was about any one particular part of the quarter all of which was pretty rough. I will say the business in the U.K., which is our biggest business over there. I had a much more solid quarter than we did on the continent or in France.

As you know, the market environment turned more cautious in the third quarter of this year. Many investors and occupiers deferred making decisions and commitments, concerns about ongoing European sovereign debt",563,"Thank you, Nick, and please turn to Slide 4. As you know, the market environment turned more cautious in the third quarter of this year. Many investors and occupiers deferred making decisions and commitments, concerns about ongoing European sovereign debt issues and slowing growth in Asia, which have been weighing on the markets most of the year were joined by heightened uncertainty starting from lower corporate profit expectations, as well as the upcoming U.S. election and so called fiscal cliff.
The increase caution was manifested in lower business volumes, particularly sale and lease transactions. In most of our geographies, also across EMEA, this was also the case in all other significant service lines.
Despite these very challenging macro conditions we were nevertheless able to improve revenue, while holding operating expenses flat exclusive of cost containment expenses, thereby supporting normalized EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, and preserving our industry-leading margins. This of course is a credit to our people and our broad diverse global platform.
We’ve worked hard over a number of years to build a well-balanced integrated platform to meet the needs of our clients. The benefits of these efforts were very evident in the third quarter of this year.
Our acquisition of the ING REIM business has added significant and largely recurring fee based revenue to our Global Investment Management operations. As a result, this segment saw revenue grow sharply and its contribution to total company normalized EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2011 increased significantly.
We’re quite pleased with the 32% normalized EBITDA margin this business delivered in the third quarter, and we believe it is indicative of where it can perform on a consistent basis.
Outsourcing continue to grow solidly with revenue up 7% globally or 11% in local currency and 13% in the Americas. Steady adoption of outsourcing continues and CBRE remains well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
We signed 67 total contracts in the third quarter, our highest total ever for one quarter, including 25 with new customers and 16 contract expansions, also single quarter company records.
Despite the slowdown in global investment sales, our mortgage brokerage business posted a double-digit revenue increase, driven by our deep and strong position in the U.S. multi-family finance market. These 2 business lines outsourcing and mortgage brokerage were the biggest growth drivers in our Americas operations.
While the property sales market was soft, we were able to expand the gap between ourselves and the number two firm in the world’s 2 largest investment markets which are drawing global capital through their status as relative safe-havens namely, the United States and United Kingdom.
The current recovery unlike previous ones remains frustratingly slow and inconsistent. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the recovery is ongoing and as we’ve been saying for some time remain subject to quick swings in market sentiment as we saw in the third quarter.
We do expect the solid finish to the year in light of current business pipelines and as always, we cautioned against judging the underlying trends in our business based on a 90-day timeframe.
Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on Slide 5. As usual, I’ll not go through them individually, but we’ve included them for your review.
And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Gil to discuss our overall performance."

Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2012, up 1% from last year or 5% in local currency. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, Investment Management and Commercial",2201,"Thank you, Brett. Please advance to Slide 6. Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2012, up 1% from last year or 5% in local currency. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, Investment Management and Commercial Mortgage Brokerage.
We recorded normalized EBITDA of $195.3 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $194.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 for a normalized EBITDA margin of 12.5% close to our 12.7% EBITDA margin achieved last year.
Cost of services increased 50 basis points to 58.8% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012 versus 58.3% in the third quarter of 2011. This increase was driven by cost containment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2012 and the decline in transaction revenues in certain geographies that has significant fixed cost compensation structure.
Despite the inclusion of all of the ING REIM costs in the operating expense line item and cost containment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2012, operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter increased by just 40 basis points from 30.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011 to 31% of revenue in the third quarter of 2012.
In light of lower business volumes in EMEA in the first 6 months of the year and our expectations for the second half of the year, we took further cost containment actions in this region, primarily headcount reductions that resulted in a charge of approximately $16 million.
This charge, as well as a charge of approximately $2 million for cost containment actions in Japan has been normalized and should result in savings of approximately $10 million on a run rate basis for 2013 and beyond.
Furthermore, reverting [ph] the value of the trade name in the United Kingdom that is no longer being broadly utilized. The non-cash write-off of this intangible asset was approximately $20 million and was also normalized.
Interest expense increased by $4.6 million in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the full impact from the financing of ING REIM acquisitions and the sterling denominated term loan A1 facility that was entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our third quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 31%. This was primarily driven by the benefits derived from a legal reorganization of certain entities in Asia-Pacific that was largely discreet to the quarter.
We are continuing to focus on the tax efficiency of legal entity and operating structure. For these reasons we now anticipate a tax rate of approximately 35% for the full year of2012.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.8 million in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to depreciation on recent increased IT-related capital expenditures and higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the ING REIM acquisitions.
Third quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.12 versus $0.20 last year. While our normalized EBITDA in the third quarter of 2012 was comparable to the prior year quarter, the combination of increased interest, depreciation and amortization expense was more than offset by a lower tax provision that reduced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.26 in the third quarter of 2012, which was up 8% as compared to $0.24 in the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 7. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the third quarter of 2012, representing 36% of total revenue in the quarter with a 7% increase or 11% in local currency over the third quarter of 2011.
Leasing remained our second largest service line, representing 29% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012, but experienced softness globally as compared to the third quarter of 2011, mostly due to increased uncertainty.
Investment sales slowed by 7% or 4% in local currency in the third quarter of 2012, with weakness also felt globally as investors grew more hesitant to deploy capital.
Global investment management revenue increased 54% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in asset management fees attributable to the ING REIM businesses.
Appraisal and valuation revenue remained flat in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors continued search for yield.
It should be noted that this is primarily a U.S.-based business where investment activity and sentiment, particularly in the multi-family sector remain stronger than in other parts of the world.
Development services revenue was down slightly to $15.9 million. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 62% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 8. Our outsourcing business continued its pattern of consistent growth, driven by record total contracts signed and new account additions, particularly in the Americas.
In the third quarter of 2012, we signed 67 contracts, once again, a new record total in company history. We closed 25 new accounts, the most ever for us in a single quarter, 26 renewals and 16 expansions also a quarterly company record.
In sectors that we see as particularly promising for growth, the company was awarded 6 new contracts and 2 expansions in the healthcare and government verticals. Reflecting the increase globalization of outsourcing, the company was awarded 2 new contracts in the EMEA and won 2 new contracts in secured 3 client expansions in Asia-Pacific.
As we have previously noted, we believe the total available market for this business is $50 billion to $60 billion. We continue to make good progress on capturing new business and feel confident about our continued global prospects for this business.
Please turn to Slide 9. This slide demonstrates steadily decreasing vacancy rates and positive absorption in all 3 market sectors depicted, along with forecasted improvement over the next year.
Average national cap rates were stable in the third quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2012 and slightly down as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to continued strength in core property sales.
Please turn to Slide 10. The Americas region showed moderate revenue growth in the aggregate driven by outsourcing. Investment sales revenue in the Americas declined by 5% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011, as investors grew more cautious about deploying capital.
CBRE once again held the number one position in the U.S. investment market for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Despite the weakness in leasing activity this quarter, the incremental office market recovery continued as the vacancy rate fell by 20 basis points to 15.5%.
Over the past year, the office vacancy rate declined by 70 basis points, indicating that the recovery is continuing in spite of the domestic and global economic headwinds. Americas outsourcing revenue grew by a strong 13% in the third quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our total revenue in EMEA declined 17%. However, when excluding the impact of foreign currency, it was down 9%. The lack of global economic growth for the region also resulted in a 17% drop in investment sales revenue in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, investment sales revenue declined 10%. The drop was driven by weakness in France and Germany. However, the United Kingdom showed strong growth as a result of the ongoing desirability of London-based prime assets. We were pleased to see that our share of United Kingdom investment sales activity nearly doubled compared to a year ago, based on information from property data.
Leasing revenue declined 24% quarter-over-quarter, illustrating the impact of economic uncertainty and occupier sentiment and the resulting caution with which they took new space and made long-term commitments.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, leasing revenue declined 18%. As with sales activity, France and Germany were particularly weak in the third quarter of 2012.
The EMEA outsourcing revenue decreased 12% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, outsourcing revenue was down only 2%, primarily due to reduced project management work versus a year ago.
Please turn to Slide 12. Our total revenue in Asia-Pacific was down 4% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. But when excluding the impact of foreign currency, it was up 2%.
While the U.S. owned debt prices and sluggish U.S. growth have hampered economic activity in Asia-Pacific all year. The decline in the rate of economic growth in China, as well as other countries in the region caused investors and occupiers to be more cautious in the third quarter of 2012.
Property sales revenue declined 6% in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, investment sales revenue declined by 2%. Leasing revenue in Asia-Pacific declined 12% and excluding the impact of foreign currency the decline was 9%.
Outsourcing revenue improved by 4% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011, excluding the impact of foreign currency, outsourcing revenue actually grew by 14%.
Please turn to slide 13. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $17.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, while third quarter normalized EBITDA declined by $1.4 million from the third quarter of 2011 to $3.8 million.
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, in process development totaled $4.6 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.9 billion. Our equity co-investments at the end of the third quarter of 2012 in the development services business totaled $82.1 million and our recourse debt stood at $15.7 million.
Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter 2012 Global Investment Management revenue increased to $114.3 million from $77.4 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees, stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM Europe and Asia, which contributed approximately $46 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2012.
It should be noted that the global real estate securities component of the business was acquired from ING on July 1, 2011, and is therefore fully included in both the current and prior quarters.
Assets under management or AUM, totaled $90.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012, down $800 million from the second quarter of 2012. This was comprised of increases of $1 billion from acquisitions, $500 million from asset value changes and $1 billion due to positive currency fluctuations, more than offset by dispositions and transfers of $3.3 billion.
Included in the $90.4 billion in AUM at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was $22.2 billion of listed securities. This represents an increase of $800 million from the second quarter of 2012, which resulted primarily from value appreciation in this portfolio.
During the third quarter of 2012, we raised new equity capital of approximately $1.5 billion in the direct real estate business and had approximately $3.5 billion of equity capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $216.8 million.
Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on slide 15. In the third quarter of 2012, we incurred $14.2 million of expenses related to ING REIM acquisitions, primarily for retention, severance, facilities and information technology.
As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $42 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 34% for the third quarter of 2012.
Slide 16 shows our liquidity position at September 30, 2012 as well as our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. The latter is virtually unchanged from the second quarter of 2012. With considerable liquidity and cash flow, we remain very comfortable with our debt maturity schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to slide 17. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use, and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and our mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.8 billion, while up by $117 million from year end 2011, net debt is down by almost $110 million from the second quarter of 2012 in line with seasonal patterns. Consistent with historical trends, our net debt is expected to decrease further in the fourth quarter of 2012.
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.6%, similar to the end of the second quarter of 2012, when including interest rate swaps. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.74x at the end of the third quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA stood at 2.1x.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

We believe that the commercial real estate recovery is continuing despite the soft patch particularly in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2012. If nothing else, the third quarter is a reminder that variable market conditions will be the norm until global economic growth and job creation shift in the higher gear.
In the interim, we expect outsourcing to continue with solid consistent growth, leasing to remain relatively subdued reflecting slower global economic and employment growth trends, investments sales activity to vary widely depending on local and regional market dynamics and investor sentiments which as we have seen can change quickly.
Investment Management comparisons will benefit less from the ING REIM businesses in Q4, relatively to the first 9 months of 2012, and full-year 2012 normalized EBITDA margins to improve. We expect conditions in Europe to remain soft until the sovereign debt challenges in Southern Europe are dealt with decisively and in Asia until more steady economic growth returns.
In the U.S., the 2 big uncertainties namely the presidential election and the fiscal cliff will be resolved one way or another shortly. This resolution will bring in greater certainty to the market.
Meanwhile, underlying markets fundamentals continue to improve incrementally. Our business pipelines are healthy and our people around the world are energized to help our clients navigate the choppy environment. CBRE remains well positioned for this market climate because of the strength, the geographic scope and the diversity of our platform, our strong financial position and the quality of our brand and people which assures clients they are always receiving the best advice. In light of the operating performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect full-year 2012 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20.
Notwithstanding current economy conditions, CBRE remains strongly positioned to thrive in a months and years ahead. To hear more about our long-term strategy, I hope you’ll be able to attend our Business Review Day this year.
Bob Sulentic will be hosting event which will take place in the morning of Thursday, December 6th at our New York City office at 200 Park.

We’ve got that cash of $700 million, $450 million available -- readily available in the U.S., around $250 million plus overseas. And we’re always anticipating what our options are with that cash.
The one thing that I can say definitively and that I think I’ve said before is we do have a high-yield bond coming due in June of next year, the 11.625. At least, there is a call on them. And whether we refinance those or partially finance those and partially use cash is yet to be determined, but you can certainly think about that in terms of an interest expense reduction, certainly for the back half of next year and the full year of 2013, if current interest rates and the current interest rate environment remains low.
So there is no specific M&A. There is no specific opportunities for cash that you wouldn’t normally think of, we’ve obviously got our core investment program in the principle businesses. We’ve got capital expenditures, the routine stuff that you would -- that you are very, very familiar with, nothing specific except that debt item that I just mentioned."

And the other thing I had mentioned as it relates to our brokerage business broadly, but our leasing business specifically, we’ve been very focused the last couple of years on upgrading our team. We have a program called move-up, move-out. We’ve been doing a decent amount of hiring to upgrade our team. We’re shifting our focus, Will, now a little bit to actually grow the headcount. And I can tell you that year-to-date, this year, we’ve made more hires in the U.S. in brokerage for instance than we did in all of last year.
So, yeah, we’ve made some market share gains in a period where the market wasn’t particularly good. And our focus was more on upgrading rather than growing the headcount. But we’re actually going to go -- we’re moving in both directions, continuing to upgrade the staff and growing headcount going forward."

As we look at the third quarter in EMEA, we didn’t differentiate one-time period within the quarter versus another, as being a driver in the outcome. It was all a pretty rough time. What was more important from us is to makeup of our business, the geographic makeup of our business.
We have a particularly large business in France, which had a very good year last year and has suffered a big time this year as a marketplace. In addition to that, it just so happens, France has also had very tough compare on FX, as you know and foreign exchange. So, the combination of the size of our business, the decline of that business in that marketplace in France, the FX circumstance with the euro has made for a very tough quarter in the third quarter in Europe.
And it was more about that from our perspective than it was about any one particular part of the quarter all of which was pretty rough. I will say the business in the U.K., which is our biggest business over there, had a much more solid quarter than we did on the continent or in France."

As you know, the market environment turned more cautious in the third quarter of this year. Many investors and occupiers deferred making decisions and commitments, concerns about ongoing European sovereign debt",562,"Thank you, Nick, and please turn to Slide 4. As you know, the market environment turned more cautious in the third quarter of this year. Many investors and occupiers deferred making decisions and commitments, concerns about ongoing European sovereign debt issues and slowing growth in Asia, which have been weighing on the markets most of the year were joined by heightened uncertainty starting from lower corporate profit expectations, as well as the upcoming U.S. election and so called fiscal cliff.
The increase caution was manifested in lower business volumes, particularly sale and lease transactions. In most of our geographies, also across EMEA, this was also the case in all other significant service lines.
Despite these very challenging macro conditions we were nevertheless able to improve revenue, while holding operating expenses flat exclusive of cost containment expenses, thereby supporting normalized EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, and preserving our industry-leading margins. This of course is a credit to our people and our broad diverse global platform.
We’ve worked hard over a number of years to build a well-balanced integrated platform to meet the needs of our clients. The benefits of these efforts were very evident in the third quarter of this year.
Our acquisition of the ING REIM business has added significant and largely recurring fee based revenue to our Global Investment Management operations. As a result, this segment saw revenue grow sharply and its contribution to total company normalized EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2011 increased significantly.
We’re quite pleased with the 32% normalized EBITDA margin this business delivered in the third quarter, and we believe it is indicative of where it can perform on a consistent basis.
Outsourcing continue to grow solidly with revenue up 7% globally or 11% in local currency and 13% in the Americas. Steady adoption of outsourcing continues and CBRE remains well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.
We signed 67 total contracts in the third quarter, our highest total ever for one quarter, including 25 with new customers and 16 contract expansions, also single quarter company records.
Despite the slowdown in global investment sales, our mortgage brokerage business posted a double-digit revenue increase, driven by our deep and strong position in the U.S. multi-family finance market. These 2 business lines outsourcing and mortgage brokerage were the biggest growth drivers in our Americas operations.
While the property sales market was soft, we were able to expand the gap between ourselves and the #2 firm in the world’s 2 largest investment markets which are drawing global capital through their status as relative safe-havens namely, the United States and United Kingdom.
The current recovery unlike previous ones remains frustratingly slow and inconsistent. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the recovery is ongoing and as we’ve been saying for some time remain subject to quick swings in market sentiment as we saw in the third quarter.
We do expect the solid finish to the year in light of current business pipelines and as always, we cautioned against judging the underlying trends in our business based on a 90-day timeframe.
Some of the most notable transactions we completed during or immediately following the quarter are shown here on Slide 5. As usual, I’ll not go through them individually, but we’ve included them for your review.
And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Gil to discuss our overall performance."

Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2012, up 1% from last year or 5% in local currency. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, Investment Management and Commercial",2201,"Thank you, Brett. Please advance to Slide 6. Total revenue was approximately $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2012, up 1% from last year or 5% in local currency. This increase was driven by growth in outsourcing, Investment Management and Commercial Mortgage Brokerage.
We recorded normalized EBITDA of $195.3 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $194.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 for a normalized EBITDA margin of 12.5% close to our 12.7% EBITDA margin achieved last year.
Cost of services increased 50 basis points to 58.8% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012 versus 58.3% in the third quarter of 2011. This increase was driven by cost containment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2012 and the decline in transaction revenues in certain geographies that has significant fixed cost compensation structure.
Despite the inclusion of all of the ING REIM costs in the operating expense line item and cost containment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2012, operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter increased by just 40 basis points from 30.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2011 to 31% of revenue in the third quarter of 2012.
In light of lower business volumes in EMEA in the first 6 months of the year and our expectations for the second half of the year, we took further cost containment actions in this region, primarily headcount reductions that resulted in a charge of approximately $16 million.
This charge, as well as a charge of approximately $2 million for cost containment actions in Japan has been normalized and should result in savings of approximately $10 million on a run rate basis for 2013 and beyond.
Furthermore, we wrote-off the value of the trade name in the United Kingdom that is no longer being broadly utilized. The non-cash write-off of this intangible asset was approximately $20 million and was also normalized.
Interest expense increased by $4.6 million in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the full impact from the financing of ING REIM acquisitions and the sterling denominated term loan A1 facility that was entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our third quarter 2012 tax rate was approximately 31%. This was primarily driven by the benefits derived from a legal reorganization of certain entities in Asia-Pacific that was largely discreet to the quarter.
We are continuing to focus on the tax efficiency of legal entity and operating structure. For these reasons we now anticipate a tax rate of approximately 35% for the full year of2012.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.8 million in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to depreciation on recent increased IT-related capital expenditures and higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the ING REIM acquisitions.
Third quarter 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.12 versus $0.20 last year. While our normalized EBITDA in the third quarter of 2012 was comparable to the prior year quarter, the combination of increased interest, depreciation and amortization expense was more than offset by a lower tax provision that reduced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.26 in the third quarter of 2012, which was up 8% as compared to $0.24 in the third quarter of 2011.
Please turn to Slide 7. Property and facilities management was our largest service line in the third quarter of 2012, representing 36% of total revenue in the quarter with a 7% increase or 11% in local currency over the third quarter of 2011.
Leasing remained our second largest service line, representing 29% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012, but experienced softness globally as compared to the third quarter of 2011, mostly due to increased uncertainty.
Investment sales slowed by 7% or 4% in local currency in the third quarter of 2012, with weakness also felt globally as investors grew more hesitant to deploy capital.
Global investment management revenue increased 54% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in asset management fees attributable to the ING REIM businesses.
Appraisal and valuation revenue remained flat in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Commercial mortgage brokerage revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by continued capital availability, generally low interest rates, competitive spreads and investors continued search for yield.
It should be noted that this is primarily a U.S.-based business where investment activity and sentiment, particularly in the multi-family sector remain stronger than in other parts of the world.
Development services revenue was down slightly to $15.9 million. Revenue from property and facilities management, fees for assets under management, loan servicing fees and leasing commissions from existing clients are all largely recurring. This revenue comprised approximately 62% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 8. Our outsourcing business continued its pattern of consistent growth, driven by record total contracts signed and new account additions, particularly in the Americas.
In the third quarter of 2012, we signed 67 contracts, once again, a new record total in company history. We closed 25 new accounts, the most ever for us in a single quarter, 26 renewals and 16 expansions also a quarterly company record.
In sectors that we see as particularly promising for growth, the company was awarded 6 new contracts and 2 expansions in the healthcare and government verticals. Reflecting the increase globalization of outsourcing, the company was awarded 2 new contracts in the EMEA and won 2 new contracts in secured 3 client expansions in Asia-Pacific.
As we have previously noted, we believe the total available market for this business is $50 billion to $60 billion. We continue to make good progress on capturing new business and feel confident about our continued global prospects for this business.

Average national cap rates were stable in the third quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2012 and slightly down as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to continued strength in core property sales.
Please turn to Slide 10. The Americas region showed moderate revenue growth in the aggregate driven by outsourcing. Investment sales revenue in the Americas declined by 5% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011, as investors grew more cautious about deploying capital.
CBRE once again held the number one position in the U.S. investment market for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Despite the weakness in leasing activity this quarter, the incremental office market recovery continued as the vacancy rate fell by 20 basis points to 15.5%.
Over the past year, the office vacancy rate declined by 70 basis points, indicating that the recovery is continuing in spite of the domestic and global economic headwinds. Americas outsourcing revenue grew by a strong 13% in the third quarter of 2012.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our total revenue in EMEA declined 17%. However, when excluding the impact of foreign currency, it was down 9%. The lack of global economic growth for the region also resulted in a 17% drop in investment sales revenue in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, investment sales revenue declined 10%. The drop was driven by weakness in France and Germany. However, the United Kingdom showed strong growth as a result of the ongoing desirability of London-based prime assets. We were pleased to see that our share of United Kingdom investment sales activity nearly doubled compared to a year ago, based on information from property data.
Leasing revenue declined 24% quarter-over-quarter, illustrating the impact of economic uncertainty and occupier sentiment and the resulting caution with which they took new space and made long-term commitments.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, leasing revenue declined 18%. As with sales activity, France and Germany were particularly weak in the third quarter of 2012.
The EMEA outsourcing revenue decreased 12% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, outsourcing revenue was down only 2%, primarily due to reduced project management work versus a year ago.
Please turn to Slide 12. Our total revenue in Asia-Pacific was down 4% as compared to the third quarter of 2011. But when excluding the impact of foreign currency, it was up 2%.
While the U.S. owned debt prices and sluggish U.S. growth have hampered economic activity in Asia-Pacific all year. The decline in the rate of economic growth in China, as well as other countries in the region caused investors and occupiers to be more cautious in the third quarter of 2012.
Property sales revenue declined 6% in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, investment sales revenue declined by 2%. Leasing revenue in Asia-Pacific declined 12% and excluding the impact of foreign currency the decline was 9%.
Outsourcing revenue improved by 4% in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011, excluding the impact of foreign currency, outsourcing revenue actually grew by 14%.
Please turn to Slide 13. Revenue for the development services segment totaled $17.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, while third quarter normalized EBITDA declined by $1.4 million from the third quarter of 2011 to $3.8 million.
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, in process development totaled $4.6 billion and the pipeline totaled $1.9 billion. Our equity co-investments at the end of the third quarter of 2012 in the development services business totaled $82.1 million and our recourse debt stood at $15.7 million.
Please turn to Slide 14. Third quarter 2012 Global Investment Management revenue increased to $114.3 million from $77.4 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase resulted from higher asset management fees, stemming from the inclusion of ING REIM Europe and Asia, which contributed approximately $46 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2012.
It should be noted that the global real estate securities component of the business was acquired from ING on July 1, 2011, and is therefore fully included in both the current and prior quarters.
Assets under management or AUM, totaled $90.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012, down $800 million from the second quarter of 2012. This was comprised of increases of $1 billion from acquisitions, $500 million from asset value changes and $1 billion due to positive currency fluctuations, more than offset by dispositions and transfers of $3.3 billion.
Included in the $90.4 billion in AUM at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was $22.2 billion of listed securities. This represents an increase of $800 million from the second quarter of 2012, which resulted primarily from value appreciation in this portfolio.
During the third quarter of 2012, we raised new equity capital of approximately $1.5 billion in the direct real estate business and had approximately $3.5 billion of equity capital to deploy at the end of the quarter. Our core investments in this business at the end of the quarter totaled $216.8 million.
Our Global Investment Management EBITDA reconciliation detail is shown on Slide 15. In the third quarter of 2012, we incurred $14.2 million of expenses related to ING REIM acquisitions, primarily for retention, severance, facilities and information technology.
As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained a cumulative accrual of carried interest compensation expense of approximately $42 million, which pertains to anticipated future carried interest revenue. This business operated at a pro forma normalized EBITDA margin of 34% for the third quarter of 2012.
Slide 16 shows our liquidity position at September 30, 2012 as well as our amortization and debt maturity schedule for all outstanding debt. The latter is virtually unchanged from the second quarter of 2012. With considerable liquidity and cash flow, we remain very comfortable with our debt maturity schedule and the flexibility it provides.
Please turn to Slide 17. Excluding cash within consolidated funds and other entities not available for company use, and excluding our non-recourse real estate loans and our mortgage brokerage warehouse facilities, our total net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.8 billion, while up by $117 million from year end 2011, net debt is down by almost $110 million from the second quarter of 2012 in line with seasonal patterns. Consistent with historical trends, our net debt is expected to decrease further in the fourth quarter of 2012.
At the end of the third quarter of 2012, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.6%, similar to the end of the second quarter of 2012, when including interest rate swaps. Our leverage ratio on a covenant basis now stands at 1.74x at the end of the third quarter of 2012 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our total company net debt to trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA stood at 2.1x.
I will now turn the call back over to Brett."

We believe that the commercial real estate recovery is continuing despite the soft patch particularly in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2012. If nothing else, the third quarter is a reminder that variable market conditions will be the norm until global economic growth and job creation shift in the higher gear.
In the interim, we expect outsourcing to continue with solid consistent growth, leasing to remain relatively subdued reflecting slower global economic and employment growth trends, investments sales activity to vary widely depending on local and regional market dynamics and investor sentiments which as we have seen can change quickly.
Investment Management comparisons will benefit less from the ING REIM businesses in Q4, relatively to the first 9 months of 2012, and full-year 2012 normalized EBITDA margins to improve. We expect conditions in Europe to remain soft until the sovereign debt challenges in Southern Europe are dealt with decisively and in Asia until more steady economic growth returns.
In the U.S., the 2 big uncertainties namely the presidential election and the fiscal cliff will be resolved one way or another shortly. This resolution will bring in greater certainty to the market.
Meanwhile, underlying markets fundamentals continue to improve incrementally. Our business pipelines are healthy and our people around the world are energized to help our clients navigate the choppy environment. CBRE remains well positioned for this market climate because of the strength, the geographic scope and the diversity of our platform, our strong financial position and the quality of our brand and people which assures clients they are always receiving the best advice. In light of the operating performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect full-year 2012 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20.
Notwithstanding current economy conditions, CBRE remains strongly positioned to thrive in a months and years ahead. To hear more about our long-term strategy, I hope you’ll be able to attend our Business Review Day this year.
Bob Sulentic will be hosting event which will take place in the morning of Thursday, December 6th at our New York City office at 200 Park.

The one thing that I can say definitively and that I think I’ve said before is we do have a high-yield bond coming due in June of next year, the 11.625. At least, there is a call on them. And whether we refinance those or partially finance those and partially use cash is yet to be determined, but you can certainly think about that in terms of an interest expense reduction, certainly for the back half of next year and the full year of 2013, if current interest rates and the current interest rate environment remains low. So there is no specific M&A. There is no specific opportunities for cash that you wouldn’t normally think of, we’ve obviously got our core investment program in the principle businesses.

As we look at the third quarter in EMEA, we didn’t differentiate one-time period within the quarter versus another, as being a driver in the outcome. It was all a pretty rough time. What was more important from us is to makeup of our business, the geographic makeup of our business. We have a particularly large business in France, which had a very good year last year and has suffered a big time this year as a marketplace. In addition to that, it just so happens, France has also had very tough compare on FX, as you know and foreign exchange. So the combination of the size of our business, the decline of that business in that marketplace in France, the FX circumstance with the euro has made for a very tough quarter in the third quarter in Europe. And it was more about that from our perspective than it was about any one particular part of the quarter all of which was pretty rough. I will say the business in the U.K., which is our biggest business over there, had a much more solid quarter than we did on the continent or in France."
