From a local currency sales basis, we are pleased with our full year 2011 performance in light of the 13% growth we reported in the year-ago period. Our strong growth in Flavors and the emerging markets continue to provide us with the ability to grow on top of last year's strong performance, as local currency sales improve 4% year-over-year for the company. In Fragrances, results were less strong, particularly in the second half. However, it must be taken in the appropriate context considering the very challenging 16% year-ago comparison which included a record level of new wins, as well as restocking benefits across all categories.
While gross margin declined due to significant raw material cost inflation of 10%, our ability to raise prices approximately 2.5% for the full year and our cost control efforts allowed us to deliver 11% adjusted operating profit growth and a 70-basis point improvement in operating profit margin. This strong operating profit performance led to an 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share to a company record of $3.74.
Analyzing our performance over 2- and 3-year periods to include the heightened volatility of 2009 and 2010, you will note that we have either met or exceeded our long-term financial targets over a 1-, 2- or 3-year basis. We thank this is a positive sign given the challenging environment we have been managing through over the past 12 months.
Before turning it over to the IFF senior team to take you through the details of our Q4 performance, love to discuss our progress against the strategic priorities we outlined at our 2011 Investor Day. Stemming from the in-depth analytical review of our business, we identified opportunities where we felt we could improve our financial performance, particularly our planned focuses on accelerating growth in attractive markets, mainly the emerging markets; aligning innovation to drive profitable growth; focusing on differentiation or offering our customers something that our competitors cannot and improving returns by fixing underperforming businesses based on economic profit analysis.
Starting with our Global footprint, we felt that we could leverage our geographic reach to capture the attractive growth rates in the emerging markets. In 2011, our local currency sales growth in the emerging markets was approximately 8%, significantly faster than the developed markets. Key emerging markets now represent 46% of our total company sales, which can be considered among best-in-class for our industry. Accordingly, earlier in 2011, we began construction of 2 manufacturing facilities in China and Singapore. As our growth in the Greater Asia region continues to accelerate, it was important that we align our infrastructure to support our projected capacity requirements. The Guangzhou site will be dedicated to Flavors, while the facility in Singapore will be used for both Flavors and Fragrances. Located near existing IFF sites, both new facilities are ideally suited to ensure a smooth transition with experienced in-house talent.
On the heels of the investment into our creative centers in Shanghai and Mumbai, we believe these facilities underscore our long-term belief in the region, the strength of our local teams and IFF dedication to serving the present and future needs of our customers as they expand in this region.
In November, we announced the opening of a new state-of-the-art Flavor and Fragrance facility in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The new site houses creative and application labs, as well as sales and marketing offices that support all categories for the unique and fast-growing Middle Eastern market. We believe that by having our creative and technical teams work very closely with our regional customers in our ultramodern lab, it will significantly shorten the innovation process and increase speed-to-market, leading to incremental business.
And more recently, we announced that a portion of our Functional Fragrance resources are being reallocated to Singapore and Mexico to more effectively serve the growing presence of our customers in those markets.
Strengthening our innovation platform continues to be most critical for our future success. In 2011, we fully evaluated our entire research and development and investments across all existing and new platforms. Our disciplined approach designed to improve our return on investment was predicated on the insight gained from our consumer research program. We then evaluated our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success including the research, development and regulatory phase. 
During this step, we also looked at the likelihood of the commercial success, which means even if we developed a solution that meets the consumer needs, can the technology be commercialized at an attractive customer and consumer price? This was then followed by a full evaluation of the technologies degree of fit within our current strategy and the opportunity cost of not pursuing the project. 
Finally, we determined the resource requirements and prioritize the highest return projects to maximize our investments.
To track our success, we have developed important internal milestones to help ensure we are achieving our stated goals. At each milestone, we evaluate our success and failure rates to determined if any adjustments are needed in an attempt to achieve the greatest efficiency possible, thus increasing return on investment.
To complement this new process, we recently formed a new Scientific Advisory Board comprised of 5 scientific talents in the key research and development areas we identified in our strategic review. We believe this advisory board will provide us with external perspectives on IFF's R&D programs, they will raise scientific issues and opportunities, help us identify appropriate research partners, provide background in specific areas of expertise and assist in identification and development of key R&D personnel. We anticipate that this will give us strong competitive advantage, not only by tapping into the minds of the Scientific Advisory Board members, but by leveraging their access to a global network of academics, high-level industry members and their associates.
By maximizing our portfolio, we believe we can enhance overall profitability by improving our less attractive portions of the portfolio to capture the previously announced $50 million operating profit opportunity within a 5-year horizon. In 2011, we began having fact-based conversations with our customers regarding appropriate pricing actions to improve our returns. We also had conversations regarding supply-chain opportunities where, by optimizing our agreements, we could drive greater efficiency for both ourselves and our customers. 
Focusing internally, we evaluated resource allocation by category, by customer and by region across both of our businesses, thereby appropriately aligning resources behind our advantage portfolio and reducing the cost associated with negative economic profit businesses. This was most evident in our recent announcement where we realigned our Functional Fragrance responsibilities and reduced our workforce in Fragrances, as well as other parts of the organization.
We believe this initiative will strengthen our expertise and our ability to win in key categories in markets, while simultaneously simplifying our decision-making process, improving our resource allocation and enhancing collaboration. It marks a significant step towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio that we have identified in our strategic review, as we expect to realize pretax cost savings of approximately $9 million in 2012.
In those areas where we are unable to improve our underperforming businesses through the aforementioned initiatives, we made the difficult decision to exit some businesses, totaling approximately $8 million of sales in 2011. 
And finally, more recently, we have instituted economic profit or EP as one of our long-term incentive compensation metrics. As part of our strategic review, we began including EP in the evaluation of relative performance across our business portfolio. We believe that evaluating EP helps us identify the resources and the drivers of value across areas of businesses, and it is linked to the creation of shareholder value.
While we are only in year one of our plan, we believe that we have made solid progress against our strategy. And while the significant raw material inflation in 2011 required us to shift our attention to more immediate needs, we never lost focus on our long-term strategy. For that, I would like to acknowledge the IFF team's ability to adapt, both strategically and operationally during very difficult times to deliver our solid results.
Once Hernan, Nicholas and Kevin conclude their prepared remarks, I will give you some perspective on the outlook for 2011 and then we will take any questions that you may have. 
With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Flavors, Hernan Weismann."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to report of the strong trends we have seen over the course of 2011 have continued in the fourth quarter, as we achieve 8% local currency sales growth, led by a double-digit increase in Beverage and high single-digit increase in Savory.
In North America, we continue to post solid growth on top of our most challenging year-over-year comparison. The majority of our success continues to come from health and wellness portfolio and our [indiscernible] modulation technology drove double-digit and high single-digit growth in Beverage and Savory, respectively. Despite comparing to a 10% increase last year in EAME, our performance in Q4 accelerated versus Q3 as Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East grew double digits and Western Europe grew mid-single digits.
In Latin America, growth of 1% was below our expectation as the softness we noticed in Mexico last quarter continued in Q4. Brazil, on the other hand, remained quite strong, growing high-single digits. Our best performing region in [indiscernible] dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Performance in this region has improved every quarter this year, growing over 10% in Q4 at every category reported strong growth, highlighted by Beverage and Confectionery where we achieved double-digit growth. To some extent, it should be noted that the timing of the Chinese New Year did provide a benefit to our results, pulling some growth from Q1 2012 into Q4 2011.
Consistent with the previous reports, the impact of exiting low-margin business in Q4 was approximately $1.5 million in local currency sales, and a total of $6 million for the full year. As we have indicated before, in 2012, we expect the impact of exiting underperforming business to increase between 1 to 3  percentage points of Flavors total currency sales growth for the full year, as we believe it is our best option to maximize shareholders' value.
It should be noted that while top line might be impacted, our gross margin should show a corresponding improvement.
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, the emerging markets continue to grow double digits for the ninth consecutive quarter. The BRIC countries continue to be the primary driver of growth, increasing mid-teens and led by 20% flat growth in China. 
Turning to profits. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 18% or $10 million to $63 million. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the previous year period to 19.6 percentage points, as volume growth [indiscernible] action and cost control more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs.
Before providing commentary in 2012, I would like to provide an overview of our full year performance. Local currency sales increased 9% in 2011 on top of the 10% we reported in the year-ago, indicating continued strength in our Flavors business. The strongest growth was achieved in North America and EAME, both growing double digits as we continue to leverage our innovative the health and wellness performance. The [indiscernible] profitability was profound, as adjusted operating profit increased 17% or $42 million to $184 million.
So [indiscernible] strong top line performance, which included both volume and [indiscernible] growth, as well as continued cost control disciplined, operating margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year to a company record of 21.1%.
Looking ahead to Q1 2012, while we are comparing to our strongest growth trade on 2011, 12% growth, we are expecting a solid start to the year as new business wins remains up strong. Profitability is expected to remain healthy as we continue to capture price increase to offset raw material cost and control our own costs.
With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrances, Mr. Nicholas Mirzayantz."
281407,145599870,218295,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Local currency sales in the fourth quarter, while down 3%, improved sequentially versus the third quarter with 5 out of our 7 categories delivering year-over-year growth. In Fine Fragrance",788,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Local currency sales in the fourth quarter, while down 3%, improved sequentially versus the third quarter with 5 out of our 7 categories delivering year-over-year growth. In Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care, local currency sales declined 6% against a 16% growth rate in Q4 2010, as new business wins and price increases were more than offset by volume declines. When evaluating Fine Fragrance independently, it is important to note that the pipeline associated with last year's new win was abnormally high as Fine Fragrance grew greater than 20% in the year-ago period, particularly, in Europe and Latin America where we grew well in excess of 20%.
Beauty Care, which include Toiletries and the Hair Care, did post high single-digit growth as the team was successful winning new business and capturing price increases. Functional Fragrance results was strong, as all categories reported positive results. Highlight within Functional Fragrance include double-digit growth in Home Care and high single-digit growth in Fabric Care, both led by the emerging markets in Europe.
It should be noted that the strong growth when combined with our recently announced 9-month initiative should drive improved returns as we continue to grow our business. It should also be noted that top line performance for our fragrance compound in Q4, which exclude ingredients, was up 2% and exiting both Ingredients and Fine Fragrance the rest of our business was up 7% in Q4.
Fragrance Ingredients continue to be the most challenged part of our portfolio in Q4 due to price-driven volume declines. Like in Q3, the adverse effect on volume was greater than historical correlations and therefore, had a greater impact on our results. While sales decline of Fragrance Ingredients margin remained stable as a loss of sales where associated with lower margin businesses thereby, reducing the impact on profitability.
Going forward, we expect market dynamics and our performance to improve as we progress through 2012. 
From a geographic perspective, emerging market growth did mitigate the weakness seen in developed markets. In our EAME region, [indiscernible] growth was achieved in Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East. In Greater Asia, China was a standout, growing mid-teens. While not surprising, given our strong year-ago comps and the current economic situation, it should be noted that Fine Fragrance and Ingredients in Western Europe decreased particularly in France, Germany and Spain, something that we will continue to monitor given the regions' economic uncertainty.
Despite a challenging second half, it is worth noting that 2011 was a record year in our Fragrance Compound business and is on top of 16% growth in 2010. 
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, adjusted operating profit declined by $9 million, as double-digit increases in raw material costs and volume declines more than offset higher prices, the benefit associated with the European restructuring and cost control initiatives. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin decreased 230 basis points to 11.5% versus the year-ago period. It is important to note that the significant pressure that raw materials placed on gross margin was reduced by increased pricing action in Q4 over 4% and cost control initiatives including lower incentive compensation expense.
In addition, our previously announced restructuring in Europe provided approximately $4 million of savings in the quarter that further help to reduce impact of raw material price increases. As Doug mentioned, we recently announced that we are reorganizing our Functional Fragrance group to align with the Global category approach of our Fine & Beauty Care and Fragrance Ingredients businesses to simplify business structure for greater efficiency. We believe this change will have a positive effect by improving our speed-to-market, grow category synergies and won consumer knowledge.
Product realignment involves a reallocation of creative resources to support investment in innovation and growth opportunities, primarily to strengthen our leadership in the emerging markets of Latin America and Greater Asia, aligned with our customer strategies and investments. 
Our decision to proceed with this plan is a clear indication of our commitment to our strategy and continuous improvements. Looking ahead, we expect top line performance in the first quarter to remain under pressure as we continue to experience price-driven volume decline in Ingredients and softness in Fine Fragrance due to a strong year-ago comparison of 15% growth.
Beyond that, we are encouraged by our continuing strong level of new wins and believe that our pipeline of new business resulting from greater access to core listings and large projects, should position us well as we progress beyond the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we continue to have incremental pricing discussions with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs. 
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin."

During our quarterly results, local currency sales growth improved sequentially versus Q3 to more than 2% in the fourth quarter as pricing approached 3.5%. While gross margin remained under pressure due to a 10% rise in raw material costs, improved leverage and sustained pricing benefits in Q4 helped reduce the impact on gross margin versus year-ago as compared to Q3. With our Q4 gross margins down 220 basis points from the year-ago period, improved versus the 330 basis points decline that we saw it in Q3. We also continue to exhibit strong cost control, including benefits from raw and incentive compensation provisions and execute against our cost savings initiative to drive 8% adjusted operating profit growth, which led to a 70 basis points improvement in operating profit margin.
With interest expense down $1 million and a $3 million benefit from other income, we were able to overcome the very low effective tax rate in Q4 2010 to drive 7% adjusted EPS growth versus the year-ago period.
Turning to raw material costs. As expected, raw material costs continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most significant in Fragrance where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove double-digit increases in our input costs. Flavor [indiscernible] costs, which were up high-single digits continue to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost increases in items such as citrus oils and menthol. 
Looking ahead, based on current prices, we expect to continue to see modest low single-digit raw material cost inflation in 2012. This is the case, even though some raw materials have come down from their market peaks. At the end, our cost in 2012 are still expected to be above our 2011 levels and sharply above historical levels. This requires continued pricing discussions with our customers.
From a 2012 calendarization standpoint, we expect raw material cost inflation to be greatest in Q1 of 2012 as we are comparing to our lowest period of 2011. Beyond the first quarter, our comparisons will become less difficult due to double-digit raw material cost increases we experienced in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2011. From an overhead cost standpoint, adjusted RSA expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 290 basis points year-over-year to 23.8%, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and continued cost discipline. Within RSA, it is important to note that we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable R&D spend increased year-over-year.
Regarding our foreign currency dynamics, foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter had a limited impact on both our top and bottom line performance. 
Looking ahead to the full year 2012, we have hedged approximately 2/3 of our Eurodollar exposure at rates, which average approximately 1.40, effectively equal to the rate we saw in 2011. While the rationale for our hedging program is to protect our cash flow exposure, i.e. the transactional impact, the mechanics of our program produced similar benefits for our translational exposure. Net-net, our exposure to euro FX volatility in 2012 has been reduced by approximately 2/3 as a result of our hedging efforts.
As such, as currency rates stay where they are today with the euro at 1.33, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be only a modest headwind to EPS for the full year 2012.
While first half 2011 cash flow had been impacted by a rise in payables, driven by a large reduction in payables associated with our 2010 annual incentive compensation payout and tax payments, both results have IFF strong financial performance second half cash flow dramatically improved versus the year-ago period. Our cash flow from operations in Q4 specifically improved $72 million from Q3, even when including the $40 million payment associated with the patent litigation settlement. As a result and as expected, our operating cash flow dramatically improved over second half of the year. 
From a use-of-cash standpoint, capital expenditures, as expected, finish the year near 5% of sales as we made incremental investments in the manufacturing capacity in the emerging markets and technologies. We expect that our investments in 2012 to also approximate 5% of sales.
In addition, over the course of 2011, we have paid off $124 million of our outstanding senior notes and importantly, renewed our credit revolver. Both of which we believe will optimize our financial flexibility going forward. 
Finally, as part of our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, we announced in July an increase in the quarterly cash dividend, raising it 15% from $0.27 a quarter to $0.31 quarter which we believe underscores our strong financial condition and excellent cash flow position.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on 2012."

Looking ahead, we expect local currency sales growth in 2012 to be in line with our long-term targets, albeit at the low end of our 4% to 6% range as we plan to accelerate the exit from some of our underperforming businesses, more particularly in Flavors. As such, we believe that our teams' ability to continue to win new business will be an important driver of our results going forward. We do expect some input costs to rise low-single digits in 2012, which will require continued pricing conversations with our customers. It is our expectation, however, that we should reach a gross margin inflection point if raw materials remain at current levels as we approach the second half of 2012.
From an RSA standpoint, we will continue to exhibit disciplined cost control. It should be noted, however, that our incentive compensation program resets, it will be a headwind should we perform in line with our current targets. In addition, we also plan to make incremental investments in R&D to support future, high-value state initiatives identified in our strategic review. These investments are vital to sustain our long-term growth. 
And finally, as Kevin mentioned, if currency rates stay where they are today with the euro at 1.33, we expect foreign exchange will be a modest headwind for the full year as a result of the hedging program.
Nonetheless, I remain confident in our ability to continue to navigate through these uncertain times as we strive to achieve the long-term targets in total. 
Looking towards the first quarter, we expect Flavors to deliver good growth, even as they exit low-margin businesses, and Fragrances to be challenged as we continue to see softness in Ingredients and pressures in Fine Fragrance due to the strong year-ago comparison. While we continue to expect greater pricing benefits, the gap between raw material costs and price increases is expected to remain as we are comparing to the lowest cost period of 2011, although this will improve versus Q4 2011.  As a result, profitability and earnings per share will be under pressure, as cost control initiatives are not expected to fully offset our gross margin pressures. 
To wrap up, at the beginning of 2011, we expressed optimism that we would continue to perform well despite macroeconomic challenges and unprecedented raw material cost increases. Our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets for the second consecutive year demonstrates the teams' aptitude for successfully executing the strategy and navigating through a challenging operating environment. 
We continue to leverage our geographic reach to capture the growth potential of the emerging markets, strengthen our innovation platform to deliver differentiating products to customers and maximize our portfolio to improve the underperforming areas of our business. I'm proud of all of our employees, each of whom played a role in achieving our results and I remain confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and work with our customers and our internal resources to achieve our long-term targets in 2012.
Longer-term, our strategic review has provided insight to management as to the opportunities to further enhance our performance going forward. Our plan embeds these insights to address the opportunities identified, all of which we believe will maximize shareholder value.
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

And while we certainly met our long-term targets for the year, we fell short of what the expectations that we have set for ourselves. And as a result of that, that has an application relative to the incentive compensation levels for 2011. I think, importantly, we should take and understand our compensation expenses, the key business operating expense associated with performance. So there is a certain amount of variability associated with that item. As we perform, that number will go up. As we don't, it will go down. In terms of the quarter, it was a material benefit for our performance. Although I continue to rather talk to the number versus what I would consider to be a normalized level. And I think in 2011 fourth quarter, that number is plus or minus, I'll give you a general number, it's about $15 million in the quarter versus a normalized level of compensation expense. So there was a benefit to that extent. To your question, on 2012, we have provided some insight and Doug has commented as it relates to our desire to strive for the long-term financial targets. And certainly, that number that is in their relative incentive compensation expense, embedded into that kind of direction that we're providing for the 2012 figures.

That we feel as if we're targeting our desire to reach the objectives. But there is certainly some uncertainty as it relates to the environment in which we will be operating. I think all the elements are important as it relates to the financial algorithm necessary to deliver against the objectives. Certainly top line growth is going to be important, some pricing is going to be important, the management of or the delivery or the savings associated with the recently announced initiatives. All of these items are going to be important for us to be able to deliver against the targets that we're going to be striving for in 2012.

From a local currency sales basis, we are pleased with our full year 2011 performance in light of the 13% growth we reported in the year-ago period. Our strong growth in Flavors and the emerging markets continue to provide us with the ability to grow on top of last year's strong performance as local currency sales improved 4% year-over-year for the company. In Fragrances, results were less strong particularly in the second half. However, it must be taken in the appropriate context, considering the very challenging 16% year-ago comparison which included a record level of new wins as well as restocking benefits across all categories.
While gross margin declined due to significant raw material cost inflation of 10%, our ability to raise prices approximately 2.5% for the full year and our cost control efforts allowed us to deliver 11% adjusted operating profit growth and a 70-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. This strong operating profit performance led to an 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share to a company record of $3.74.
Analyzing our performance over 2- and 3-year periods to include the heightened volatility of 2009 and 2010, you will note that we have either met or exceeded our long-term financial targets over a 1-, 2- or 3-year basis. We think this is a positive sign given the challenging environment we have been managing through over the past 12 months.
Before turning it over to the IFF senior team to take you through the details of our Q4 performance, I'd like to discuss our progress against the strategic priorities we outlined at our 2011 Investor Day.
Stemming from the in-depth analytical review of our business, we identified opportunities where we felt we could improve our financial performance, particularly our planned focuses on accelerating growth in attractive markets, mainly the emerging markets; aligning innovation to drive profitable growth; focusing on differentiation or offering our customers something that our competitors cannot; and improving returns by fixing underperforming businesses based on economic profit analysis.
Starting with our Global footprint, we felt that we could leverage our geographic reach to capture the attractive growth rates in the emerging markets. In 2011, our local currency sales growth in the emerging markets was approximately 8%, significantly faster than the developed markets. Key emerging markets now represent 46% of our total company sales, which can be considered among best in class for our industry.
Accordingly, earlier in 2011, we began construction of 2 manufacturing facilities in China and Singapore. As our growth in the Greater Asia region continues to accelerate, it was important that we align our infrastructure to support our projected capacity requirements. The Guangzhou site will be dedicated to Flavors while the facility in Singapore will be used for both Flavors and Fragrances. Located near existing IFF sites, both new facilities are ideally suited to ensure a smooth transition with experienced in-house talent.
On the heels of the investment into our creative centers in Shanghai and Mumbai, we believe these facilities underscore our long-term belief in the region, the strength of our local teams and IFF's dedication to serving the present and future needs of our customers as they expand in this region.
In November, we announced the opening of a new state-of-the-art Flavor and Fragrance facility in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The new site houses creative and application labs as well as sales and marketing offices that support all categories for the unique and fast-growing Middle Eastern market. We believe that, by having our creative and technical teams work very closely with regional customers in our ultramodern labs, it will significantly shorten the innovation process and increase speed to market, leading to incremental business.
And more recently, we announced that a portion of our Functional Fragrance resources are being reallocated to Singapore and Mexico to more effectively serve the growing presence of our customers in those markets.
Strengthening our innovation platform continues to be most critical for our future success. In 2011, we fully evaluated our entire research and development investments across all existing and new platforms. Our disciplined approach designed to improve our return on investment was predicated on the insight gained from our consumer research program. We then evaluated our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success, including the research, development and regulatory phase.
During this step, we also looked at the likelihood of the commercial success, which means even if we develop a solution that meets the consumers' needs, can the technology be commercialized at an attractive customer and consumer price? This was then followed by a full evaluation of the technology's degree of fit within our current strategy and the opportunity cost of not pursuing the project. Finally, we determined the resource requirements and prioritized the highest-return projects to maximize our investments.
To track our success, we have developed important internal milestones to help ensure we are achieving our stated goals. At each milestone, we evaluate our success and failure rates to determine if any adjustments are needed in an attempt to achieve the greatest efficiency possible, thus increasing return on investment.
To complement this new process, we recently formed a new scientific advisory board comprised of 5 scientific talents in the key research and development areas we identified in our strategic review. We believe this advisory board will provide us with external perspectives on IFF's R&D programs. They will raise scientific issues and opportunities, help us identify appropriate research partners, provide background in specific areas of expertise and assist in the identification and development of key R&D personnel. We anticipate that this will give us strong competitive advantage not only by tapping into the minds of the scientific advisory board members but by leveraging their access to a global network of academics, high-level industry members and their associates.
By maximizing our portfolio, we believe we can enhance overall profitability by improving our less-attractive portions of the portfolio to capture the previously announced $50 million operating profit opportunity within a 5-year horizon. In 2011, we began having fact-based conversations with our customers regarding appropriate pricing actions to improve our returns. We also had conversations regarding supply chain opportunities where, by optimizing our agreements, we could drive greater efficiency for both ourselves and our customers.
Focusing internally, we evaluated resource allocation by category, by customer and by region across both of our businesses, thereby appropriately aligning resources behind our advantage portfolio and reducing the costs associated with negative economic profit businesses. This was most evident in our recent announcement where we realigned our Functional Fragrance responsibilities and reduced our workforce in Fragrances as well as other parts of the organization.
We believe this initiative will strengthen our expertise and our ability to win in key categories and markets while simultaneously simplifying our decision-making process, improving our resource allocation and enhancing collaboration. It marks a significant step towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio that we have identified in our strategic review as we expect to realize pretax cost savings of approximately $9 million in 2012.
In those areas where we were unable to improve our underperforming businesses through the aforementioned initiatives, we made the difficult decision to exit some businesses, totaling approximately $8 million of sales in 2011.
And finally, more recently, we have instituted economic profit or EP as one of our long-term incentive compensation metrics. As part of our strategic review, we began including EP in the evaluation of relative performance across our business portfolio. We believe that evaluating EP helps us identify the resources and the drivers of value across various businesses and it is linked to the creation of shareholder value.
While we are only in year one of our plan, we believe that we have made solid progress against our strategy. And while the significant raw material inflation in 2011 required us to shift our attention to more immediate needs, we never lost focus on our long-term strategy. For that, I would like to acknowledge the IFF's team's ability to adapt both strategically and operationally during very difficult times to deliver our solid results.
Once Hernan, Nicolas and Kevin conclude their prepared remarks, I will give you some perspectives on the outlook for 2012, and then we will take any questions that you may have. With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman."

In Latin America, growth of 1% was below our expectation as the softness we noticed in Mexico last quarter continued into Q4. Brazil, on the other hand, remained quite strong, growing high-single digits.
Our best performing region in terms of both dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Performance in this region has improved every quarter this year, growing over 10% in Q4 as every category reported a strong growth, highlighted by Beverage and Confectionery where we achieved double-digit growth. To some extent, it should be noted that the timing of the Chinese New Year did provide a benefit to our results, pulling some growth from Q1 2012 into Q4 2011.
Consistent with the previous 3 quarters, the impact of exiting low-margin business in Q4 was approximately $1.5 million in local currency sales and a total of $6 million for the full year. As we have indicated before, in 2012 we expect the impact of exiting underperforming business to increase between 1 to 3 percentage points of Flavors total local currency sales growth for the full year, as we believe it is our best option to maximize shareholder's value. It should be noted that, while top line may be impacted, our gross margin should show a corresponding improvement.
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, the emerging markets continue to grow double digits for the ninth consecutive quarter. The BRIC countries continue to be the primary driver of growth, increasing mid teens and led by 20% flat growth in China.
Turning to profits. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 18% or $10 million to $63 million. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior-year period to 19.6 percentage as volume growth, pricing action and cost control more than offset the impact of higher raw material cost.
Before providing commentary in 2012, I would like to provide an overview of our full year performance. Local currency sales increased 9% in 2011 on top of the 10% we reported in the year ago, indicating continued strength in our Flavors business. The strongest growth was achieved in North America and EAME both growing double digits as we continue to deleverage of our innovative health and wellness portfolio. The effect on profitability was profound as adjusted operating profit increased 17% or $42 million to $184 million.
As a result of this strong top line performance, which included both volume and pricing growth as well as continued cost control disciplines, operating margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year to a company record of 21.1%.
Looking ahead to Q1 2012, while we are comparing to our strongest growth rate on 2011, 12% growth, we are expecting a solid start to the year as new business wins remain strong. Profitability is expected to remain healthy as we continue to capture price increase to offset raw material cost and control our own costs.
With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrance, Nicolas Mirzayantz."
281407,145599870,218530,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.Local currency sales in the fourth quarter, while down 3%, improved sequentially versus the third quarter with 5 out of our 7 categories delivering year-over-year growth. In Fine Fragrance",797,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.
Local currency sales in the fourth quarter, while down 3%, improved sequentially versus the third quarter with 5 out of our 7 categories delivering year-over-year growth. In Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care, local currency sales declined 6% against a 16% growth rate in Q4 2010 as new business wins and price increases were more than offset by volume declines.
When evaluating Fine Fragrance independently, it is important to note that the pipeline's few links [ph] associated with last year's new win was abnormally high as Fine Fragrance grew greater than 20% in the year-ago period, particularly in Europe and Latin America where we grew way in excess of 20%.
Beauty Care, which include Toiletries and Hair Care, did post strong high-single-digit growth as the team was successful willing -- winning new business and capturing price increases.
Functional Fragrance results was strong as all categories reported positive results. Highlight within Functional Fragrance include double-digit growth in Home Care and high-single-digit growth in Fabric Care both led by the emerging markets and Europe.
It should be noted that the strong growth, when combined with our recently announced realignment initiative, should drive improved returns as we continue to grow our business. It should also be noted that top line performance for our fragrance compound in Q4, which exclude Ingredients, was up 2%. And excluding both Ingredients and Fine Fragrance, the rest of our business was up 7% in Q4.
Fragrance Ingredients continue to be the most challenged part of our portfolio in Q4 due to price-driven volume declines. Like in Q3, the adverse effect on volume was greater than historical correlations and therefore had a greater impact on our results. While sales decline, our Fragrance Ingredients margin remained stable as the loss of sales were associated with lower-margin businesses, thereby reducing the impact on profitability.
Going forward, we expect market dynamics and our performance to improve as we progress through 2012.
From a geographic perspective, emerging market growth did mitigate the weakness seen in the developed markets. In our EAME region, double-digit growth was achieved in Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East. In Greater Asia, China was a standout, growing mid teens. While not surprising, given our strong year-ago comps and the current economic situation, it should be noted that Fine Fragrance and Ingredients in Western Europe decreased particularly in France, Germany and Spain, something that we will continue to monitor given the region's economic uncertainty.
Despite a challenging second half, it is worth noting that 2011 was a record year in our fragrance compound business and is on top of 16% growth in 2010.
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, adjusted operating profit declined by $9 million as double-digit increases in raw material cost and volume declines more than offset higher prices, the benefit associated with the European restructuring and cost control initiatives. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin decreased 230 basis points to 11.5% versus the year-ago period. It is important to note that the significant pressure that raw materials placed on gross margin was reduced by increased pricings actions in Q4, over 4%, and cost control initiatives including lower incentive compensation expense. In addition, our previously announced restructuring in Europe provided approximately $4 million of saving in the quarter that further helped to reduce the impact of raw material price increases.
As Doug mentioned, we recently announced that we are reorganizing our Functional Fragrance group to align with the Global category approach of our Fine & Beauty Care and Fragrance Ingredient businesses to simplify the business structure for greater efficiency. We believe these changes will have a positive effect by improving our speed to market, cross-category synergies and one consumer knowledge.
Part of this realignment involves a reallocation of creative resources to support investment in innovation and growth opportunities, primarily to strengthen our leadership in the emerging markets of Latin America and Greater Asia, aligned with our customer strategies and investments. Our decision to proceed with this plan is a clear indication of our commitment to our strategy and continuous improvements.
Looking ahead, we expect top line performance in the first quarter to remain under pressure as we continue to experience price-driven volume declines in Ingredients and softness in Fine Fragrance due to a strong year-ago comparison of 15% growth.
Beyond that, we are encouraged by our continuing strong level of new wins and believe that our pipeline of new business resulting from greater access to core listings and large projects should position us well as we progress beyond the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we continue to have incremental pricing discussions with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs.
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin."
281407,145599870,218530,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.Reviewing our quarterly results, local currency sales growth improved sequentially versus Q3 to more than 2% in the fourth quarter as pricing approached 3.5%. While gross margin remained",811,"Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone.
Reviewing our quarterly results, local currency sales growth improved sequentially versus Q3 to more than 2% in the fourth quarter as pricing approached 3.5%. While gross margin remained under pressure due to a 10% rise in raw material cost, improved leverage and sustained pricing benefits in Q4 helped reduce the impact on gross margin versus a year ago, as compared to Q3, with our Q4 gross margin down 220 basis points from the year-ago period, improved versus the 330-basis-point decline that we saw in Q3.
We also continue to exhibit strong cost control, including benefits from lower incentive compensation provisions, and execute against our cost savings initiative to drive 8% adjusted operating profit growth which led to a 70 basis points improvement in operating profit margin.
With interest expense down $1 million and a $3 million benefit from other income, we were able to overcome the very low effective tax rate in Q4 2010 to drive 7% adjusted EPS growth versus the year-ago period.
Turning to raw material costs. As expected, raw material costs continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most significant in Fragrance where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove double-digit increases in our input costs. Flavor input costs, which were up high-single digits, continue to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost increases in items such as citrus oils and mint and menthol.
Looking ahead, based on current prices, we expect to continue to see modest low-single-digit raw material cost inflation in 2012. This is the case even though some raw materials have come down from their market peaks. At the end, our costs in 2012 are still expected to be above our 2011 levels and sharply above historical levels. This requires continued pricing discussions with our customers.
From a 2012 calendarization standpoint, we expect raw material cost inflation to be greatest in Q1 of 2012, as we are comparing to our lowest cost period of 2011. Beyond the first quarter, our comparisons will become less difficult due to the double-digit raw material cost increases we experienced in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2011.
From an overhead cost standpoint, adjusted RSA expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 290 basis points year-over-year to 23.8%, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and continued cost discipline. Within RSA, it is important to note that we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable R&D spend increased year-over-year.
Regarding foreign currency dynamics, foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter had a limited impact on both our top and bottom line performance.
Looking ahead to the full year 2012, we have hedged approximately 2/3 of our euro-dollar exposure at rates which average approximately 1.40, effectively equal to the rate we saw in 2011. While the rationale for our hedging program is to protect our cash flow exposure, i.e., the transactional impact, the mechanics of our program produced similar benefits for our translational exposure. Net-net, our exposure to euro FX volatility in 2012 has been reduced by approximately 2/3 as the result of our hedging efforts. As such, if currency rates stay where they are today with the euro at $1.33, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be only a modest headwind to EPS for the full year of 2012.
While first half 2011 cash flow had been impacted by a rise in payables, driven by a large reduction in payables associated with our 2010 annual incentive compensation payout and tax payments, both the results of IFF's strong 2010 financial performance, second half cash flow dramatically improved versus the year-ago period. Our cash flow from operations in Q4 specifically improved $72 million from Q3, even when including the $40 million payment associated with the patent litigation settlement. As a result and as expected, our operating cash flow dramatically improved over the second half of the year.
From a use-of-cash standpoint, capital expenditures, as expected, finished the year near 5% of sales as we made incremental investments in manufacturing capacity in the emerging markets and technologies. We expect that our investments in 2012 to also approximate 5% of sales.
In addition, over the course of 2011, we have paid off $124 million of our outstanding senior notes and, importantly, renewed our credit revolver, both of which we believe will optimize our financial flexibility, going forward.
Finally, as part of our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, we announced in July an increase in the quarterly cash dividend, raising it 15% from $0.27 a quarter to $0.31 a quarter, which we believe underscores our strong financial condition and excellent cash flow position.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on 2012."

Looking ahead, we expect local currency sales growth in 2012 to be in line with our long-term targets, albeit at the low end of our 4% to 6% range, as we plan to accelerate the exit from some of our underperforming businesses, more particularly in Flavors. As such, we believe that our team's ability to continue to win new business will be an important driver of our results, going forward.
We do expect some input costs to rise low-single digits in 2012, which will require continued pricing conversations with our customers. It is our expectation, however, that we should reach a gross margin inflection point if raw materials remain at current levels as we approach the second half of 2012.
From an RSA standpoint, we will continue to exhibit disciplined cost control. It should be noted, however, that as our incentive compensation program resets, it will be a headwind should we perform in line with our current targets. In addition, we also plan to make incremental investments in R&D to support future high-value at-stake initiatives identified in our strategic review. These investments are vital to sustain our long-term growth.
And finally, as Kevin mentioned, if currency rates stay where they are today, with the euro at $1.33, we expect foreign exchange will be a modest headwind for the full year as a result of the hedging program.
Nonetheless, I remain confident in our ability to continue to navigate through these uncertain times as we strive to achieve the long-term targets in total.
Looking towards the first quarter, we expect Flavors to deliver good growth, even as they exit low-margin businesses, and Fragrances to be challenged as we continue to see softness in Ingredients and pressures in Fine Fragrance due to the strong year-ago comparison. While we continue to expect greater pricing benefits, the gap between raw material costs and price increases is expected to remain as we are comparing to the lowest-cost period of 2011, although this will improve versus Q4 2011.  As a result, profitability and earnings per share will be under pressure as cost control initiatives are not expected to fully offset our gross margin pressures.
To wrap up. At the beginning of 2011, we expressed optimism that we would continue to perform well despite macroeconomic challenges and unprecedented raw material cost increases. Our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets for the second consecutive year demonstrates the team's aptitude for successfully executing the strategy and navigating through a challenging operating environment.
We continue to leverage our geographic reach to capture the growth potential of the emerging markets, strengthen our innovation platform to deliver differentiating products to customers and maximize our portfolio to improve the underperforming areas of our business.
I'm proud of all of our employees, each of whom played a role in achieving our results, and I remain confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and work with our customers and our internal resources to achieve our long-term targets in 2012.
Longer term, our strategic review has provided insight to management as to the opportunities to further enhance our performance, going forward. Our plan embeds these insights to address the opportunities identified, all of which, we believe, will maximize shareholder value.
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

I mean, it was 16% growth, which was greater than any year in the business, it really was a record year, and also significantly higher growth rate than the industry. If you look at it, it was seventh consecutive quarter of growth and obviously some pressure in the second half. Unfortunately, the difficult comparison as well as price-driven volume declines in Ingredients did put some pressure in the results and especially also in fine where we had the strongest comp in 2010. So I think that, overall, if you put this thing into perspective and if you look at a 2-year average, I think it's indeed a very, very strong average for the business, being at 8% growth, so in excess of the market. I think what is important as well is our ability to secure new business and also to have access to additional growth potential by entering new colleagues or strengthening our position into some new colleagues. So yes, challenged in the second half, but we believe that most of the key driver was a strong comp. And if you remember also, in Q1 of this year, we were still having some strong growth in the business units and very strong growth in Q4, so therefore, we believe that we have an abnormally high level of pipeline, which affected some of the volume dynamic in the second half."

And as a result of that, that has an implication relative to the incentive compensation levels for 2011. I think, importantly, we should take and understand our compensation expenses, the key business operating expense associated with performance. So there is a certain amount of variability associated with that item. As we perform, that number will go up. As we don't, it will go down. In terms of the quarter, it was a material benefit for our performance, although I continue to rather talk to the number versus what I would consider to be a normalized level. And I think, in 2011 fourth quarter, that number is plus or minus: I'll give you a general number, it's around $15 million in the quarter versus a normalized level of compensation expense, so there was a benefit to that extent. To your question on 2012, we have provided some insight, and Doug has commented, as it relates to our desire to strive for the long-term financial targets. And certainly, that number that is in there relative to incentive compensation expenses embedded into that kind of direction that we're providing for the 2012 figures. So it's embedded into that figure."

I think all the elements are important, as it relates to the financial algorithm necessary to deliver against the objectives. Certainly, top line growth is going to be important, some pricing is going to be important, the management of or the delivery and the savings associated with the recently announced initiative.

From a local currency sales basis, we are pleased with our full year 2011 performance in light of the 13% growth we reported in the year-ago period. Our strong growth in Flavors and the emerging markets continue to provide us with the ability to grow on top of last year's strong performance as local currency sales improved 4% year-over-year for the company. In Fragrances, results were less strong particularly in the second half. However, it must be taken in the appropriate context, considering the very challenging 16% year-ago comparison, which included a record level of new wins as well as restocking benefits across all categories.
While gross margin declined due to significant raw material cost inflation of 10%, our ability to raise prices approximately 2.5% for the full year and our cost control efforts allowed us to deliver 11% adjusted operating profit growth and a 70-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. This strong operating profit performance led to an 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share to a company record of $3.74.
Analyzing our performance over 2- and 3-year periods to include the heightened volatility of 2009 and 2010, you will note that we have either met or exceeded our long-term financial targets over a 1-, 2- or 3-year basis. We think this is a positive sign given the challenging environment we have been managing through over the past 12 months.
Before turning it over to the IFF senior team to take you through the details of our Q4 performance, I'd like to discuss our progress against the strategic priorities we outlined at our 2011 Investor Day.
Stemming from the in-depth analytical review of our business, we identified opportunities where we felt we could improve our financial performance, particularly our planned focuses on accelerating growth in attractive markets, mainly the emerging markets; aligning innovation to drive profitable growth; focusing on differentiation or offering our customers something that our competitors cannot; and improving returns by fixing underperforming businesses based on economic profit analysis.
Starting with our Global footprint, we felt that we could leverage our geographic reach to capture the attractive growth rates in the emerging markets. In 2011, our local currency sales growth in the emerging markets was approximately 8%, significantly faster than the developed markets. Key emerging markets now represent 46% of our total company sales, which can be considered among best in class for our industry.
Accordingly, earlier in 2011, we began construction of 2 manufacturing facilities in China and Singapore. As our growth in the Greater Asia region continues to accelerate, it was important that we align our infrastructure to support our projected capacity requirements. The Guangzhou site will be dedicated to Flavors while the facility in Singapore will be used for both Flavors and Fragrances. Located near existing IFF sites, both new facilities are ideally suited to ensure a smooth transition with experienced in-house talent.
On the heels of the investment into our creative centers in Shanghai and Mumbai, we believe these facilities underscore our long-term belief in the region, the strength of our local teams and IFF's dedication to serving the present and future needs of our customers as they expand in this region.
In November, we announced the opening of a new state-of-the-art Flavor and Fragrance facility in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The new site houses creative and application labs as well as sales and marketing offices that support all categories for the unique and fast-growing Middle Eastern market. We believe that by having our creative and technical teams work very closely with regional customers in our ultramodern labs, it will significantly shorten the innovation process and increase speed to market, leading to incremental business.
And more recently, we announced that a portion of our Functional Fragrance resources are being reallocated to Singapore and Mexico to more effectively serve the growing presence of our customers in those markets.
Strengthening our innovation platform continues to be most critical for our future success. In 2011, we fully evaluated our entire research and development investments across all existing and new platforms. Our disciplined approach designed to improve our return on investment was predicated on the insight gained from our consumer research program. We then evaluated our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account the technical likelihood of success, including the research, development and regulatory phase.
During this step, we also looked at the likelihood of the commercial success, which means even if we develop a solution that meets the consumers' needs, can the technology be commercialized at an attractive customer and consumer price? This was then followed by a full evaluation of the technology's degree of fit within our current strategy and the opportunity cost of not pursuing the project. Finally, we determined the resource requirements and prioritized the highest-return projects to maximize our investments.
To track our success, we have developed important internal milestones to help ensure we are achieving our stated goals. At each milestone, we evaluate our success and failure rates to determine if any adjustments are needed in an attempt to achieve the greatest efficiency possible, thus increasing return on investment.
To complement this new process, we recently formed a new scientific advisory board comprised of 5 scientific talents in the key research and development areas we identified in our strategic review. We believe this advisory board will provide us with external perspectives on IFF's R&D programs. They will raise scientific issues and opportunities, help us identify appropriate research partners, provide background in specific areas of expertise and assist in the identification and development of key R&D personnel. We anticipate that this will give us strong competitive advantage not only by tapping into the minds of the scientific advisory board members, but by leveraging their access to a global network of academics, high-level industry members and their associates.
By maximizing our portfolio, we believe we can enhance overall profitability by improving our less-attractive portions of the portfolio to capture the previously announced $50 million operating profit opportunity within a 5-year horizon. In 2011, we began having fact-based conversations with our customers regarding appropriate pricing actions to improve our returns. We also had conversations regarding supply chain opportunities where, by optimizing our agreements, we could drive greater efficiency for both ourselves and our customers.
Focusing internally, we evaluated resource allocation by category, by customer and by region across both of our businesses, thereby appropriately aligning resources behind our advantage portfolio and reducing the costs associated with negative economic profit businesses. This was most evident in our recent announcement where we realigned our Functional Fragrance responsibilities and reduced our workforce in Fragrances as well as other parts of the organization.
We believe this initiative will strengthen our expertise and our ability to win in key categories and markets while simultaneously simplifying our decision-making process, improving our resource allocation and enhancing collaboration. It marks a significant step towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio that we have identified in our strategic review as we expect to realize pretax cost savings of approximately $9 million in 2012.
In those areas where we were unable to improve our underperforming businesses through the aforementioned initiatives, we made the difficult decision to exit some businesses, totaling approximately $8 million of sales in 2011.
And finally, more recently, we have instituted economic profit, or EP, as one of our long-term incentive compensation metrics. As part of our strategic review, we began including EP in the evaluation of relative performance across our business portfolio. We believe that evaluating EP helps us identify the resources and the drivers of value across various businesses and it is linked to the creation of shareholder value.
While we are only in year one of our plan, we believe that we have made solid progress against our strategy. And while the significant raw material inflation in 2011 required us to shift our attention to more immediate needs, we never lost focus on our long-term strategy. For that, I would like to acknowledge the IFF's team's ability to adapt both strategically and operationally during very difficult times to deliver our solid results.
Once Hernan, Nicolas and Kevin conclude their prepared remarks, I will give you some perspectives on the outlook for 2012, and then we will take any questions that you may have. With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman."

I am happy to report that the strong trends we have seen over the course of 2011 have continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved 8% local currency sales growth, led by a double-digit increase in Beverage and high-single-digit increase in Savory.
In North America, we continue to post solid growth on top of our most challenging year-over-year comparison. The majority of our success continues to come from health and wellness portfolio, as our sweet and sodium modulation technologies drove double-digit and high-single-digit growth in Beverage and Savory, respectively.
Despite comparing to a 10% increase last year in EAME, our performance in Q4 accelerated versus Q3 as Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East grew double digits and Western Europe grew mid-single digits.
In Latin America, growth of 1% was below our expectation as the softness we noticed in Mexico last quarter continued into Q4. Brazil, on the other hand, remained quite strong, growing high-single digits.
Our best performing region in terms of both dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Performance in this region has improved every quarter this year, growing over 10% in Q4 as every category reported a strong growth, highlighted by Beverage and Confectionery where we achieved double-digit growth. To some extent, it should be noted that the timing of the Chinese New Year did provide a benefit to our results, pulling some growth from Q1 2012 into Q4 2011.
Consistent with the previous 3 quarters, the impact of exiting low-margin business in Q4 was approximately $1.5 million in local currency sales and a total of $6 million for the full year. As we have indicated before, in 2012 we expect the impact of exiting underperforming business to increase between 1 to 3 percentage points of Flavors total local currency sales growth for the full year, as we believe it is our best option to maximize shareholder's value. It should be noted that, while top line may be impacted, our gross margin should show a corresponding improvement.
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, the emerging markets continue to grow double digits for the ninth consecutive quarter. The BRIC countries continue to be the primary driver of growth, increasing mid teens and led by 20% flat growth in China.
Turning to profits. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 18% or $10 million to $63 million. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior-year period to 19.6 percentage as volume growth, pricing action and cost control more than offset the impact of higher raw material cost.
Before providing commentary in 2012, I would like to provide an overview of our full year performance. Local currency sales increased 9% in 2011 on top of the 10% we reported in the year ago, indicating continued strength in our Flavors business. The strongest growth was achieved in North America and EAME, both growing double digits as we continue to deleverage of our innovative health and wellness portfolio. The effect on profitability was profound as adjusted operating profit increased 17% or $42 million to $184 million.
As a result of this strong top line performance, which included both volume and pricing growth as well as continued cost control disciplines, operating margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year to a company record of 21.1%.
Looking ahead to Q1 2012, while we are comparing to our strongest growth rate on 2011, 12% growth, we are expecting a solid start to the year as new business wins remain strong. Profitability is expected to remain healthy as we continue to capture price increase to offset raw material cost and control our own costs.
With that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrance, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

Local currency sales in the fourth quarter, while down 3%, improved sequentially versus the third quarter, with 5 out of our 7 categories delivering year-over-year growth. In Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care, local currency sales declined 6% against a 16% growth rate in Q4 2010 as new business wins and price increases were more than offset by volume declines.
When evaluating Fine Fragrance independently, it is important to note that the pipeline's few links [ph] associated with last year's new win was abnormally high as Fine Fragrance grew greater than 20% in the year-ago period, particularly in Europe and Latin America, where we grew way in excess of 20%.
Beauty Care, which include Toiletries and Hair Care, did post strong high-single-digit growth as the team was successful willing -- winning new business and capturing price increases.
Functional Fragrance results were strong as all categories reported positive results. Highlight within Functional Fragrance include double-digit growth in Home Care and high-single-digit growth in Fabric Care, both led by the emerging markets and Europe.
It should be noted that the strong growth, when combined with our recently announced realignment initiative, should drive improved returns as we continue to grow our business. It should also be noted that top line performance for our fragrance compound in Q4, which exclude Ingredients, was up 2%. And excluding both Ingredients and Fine Fragrance, the rest of our business was up 7% in Q4.
Fragrance Ingredients continue to be the most challenged part of our portfolio in Q4 due to price-driven volume declines. Like in Q3, the adverse effect on volume was greater than historical correlations and therefore had a greater impact on our results. While sales decline, our Fragrance Ingredients margin remained stable as the loss of sales were associated with lower-margin businesses, thereby reducing the impact on profitability.
Going forward, we expect market dynamics and our performance to improve as we progress through 2012.
From a geographic perspective, emerging market growth did mitigate the weakness seen in the developed markets. In our EAME region, double-digit growth was achieved in Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East. In Greater Asia, China was a standout, growing mid teens. While not surprising, given our strong year-ago comps and the current economic situation, it should be noted that Fine Fragrance and Ingredients in Western Europe decreased particularly in France, Germany and Spain, something that we will continue to monitor given the region's economic uncertainty.
Despite a challenging second half, it is worth noting that 2011 was a record year in our fragrance compound business and is on top of 16% growth in 2010.
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, adjusted operating profit declined by $9 million as double-digit increases in raw material cost and volume declines more than offset higher prices, the benefit associated with the European restructuring and cost control initiatives. As a result, adjusted operating profit margin decreased 230 basis points to 11.5% versus the year-ago period. It is important to note that the significant pressure that raw materials placed on gross margin was reduced by increased pricings actions in Q4, over 4%, and cost control initiatives, including lower incentive compensation expense. In addition, our previously announced restructuring in Europe provided approximately $4 million of saving in the quarter that further helped to reduce the impact of raw material price increases.
As Doug mentioned, we recently announced that we are reorganizing our Functional Fragrance group to align with the Global category approach of our Fine & Beauty Care and Fragrance Ingredient businesses to simplify the business structure for greater efficiency. We believe these changes will have a positive effect by improving our speed to market, cross-category synergies and one consumer knowledge.
Part of this realignment involves a reallocation of creative resources to support investment in innovation and growth opportunities, primarily to strengthen our leadership in the emerging markets of Latin America and Greater Asia, aligned with our customer strategies and investments. Our decision to proceed with this plan is a clear indication of our commitment to our strategy and continuous improvements.
Looking ahead, we expect top line performance in the first quarter to remain under pressure as we continue to experience price-driven volume declines in Ingredients and softness in Fine Fragrance due to a strong year-ago comparison of 15% growth.
Beyond that, we are encouraged by our continuing strong level of new wins and believe that our pipeline of new business resulting from greater access to core listings and large projects should position us well as we progress beyond the first quarter of 2012. In addition, we continue to have incremental pricing discussions with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs.
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin."

Reviewing our quarterly results, local currency sales growth improved sequentially versus Q3 to more than 2% in the fourth quarter as pricing approached 3.5%. While gross margin remained under pressure due to a 10% rise in raw material cost, improved leverage and sustained pricing benefits in Q4 helped reduce the impact on gross margin versus a year ago, as compared to Q3, with our Q4 gross margin down 220 basis points from the year-ago period, improved versus the 330-basis-point decline that we saw in Q3.
We also continue to exhibit strong cost control, including benefits from lower incentive compensation provisions, and execute against our cost savings initiative to drive 8% adjusted operating profit growth, which led to a 70 basis points improvement in operating profit margin.
With interest expense down $1 million and a $3 million benefit from other income, we were able to overcome the very low effective tax rate in Q4 2010 to drive 7% adjusted EPS growth versus the year-ago period.
Turning to raw material costs. As expected, raw material costs continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most significant in Fragrance where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove double-digit increases in our input costs. Flavor input costs, which were up high-single digits, continue to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost increases in items such as citrus oils and mint and menthol.
Looking ahead, based on current prices, we expect to continue to see modest low-single-digit raw material cost inflation in 2012. This is the case even though some raw materials have come down from their market peaks. At the end, our costs in 2012 are still expected to be above our 2011 levels and sharply above historical levels. This requires continued pricing discussions with our customers.
From a 2012 calendarization standpoint, we expect raw material cost inflation to be greatest in Q1 of 2012, as we are comparing to our lowest cost period of 2011. Beyond the first quarter, our comparisons will become less difficult due to the double-digit raw material cost increases we experienced in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2011.
From an overhead cost standpoint, adjusted RSA expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 290 basis points year-over-year to 23.8%, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and continued cost discipline. Within RSA, it is important to note that we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable R&D spend increased year-over-year.
Regarding foreign currency dynamics, foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter had a limited impact on both our top and bottom line performance.
Looking ahead to the full year 2012, we have hedged approximately 2/3 of our euro-dollar exposure at rates which average approximately 1.40, effectively equal to the rate we saw in 2011. While the rationale for our hedging program is to protect our cash flow exposure, i.e., the transactional impact, the mechanics of our program produced similar benefits for our translational exposure. Net-net, our exposure to euro FX volatility in 2012 has been reduced by approximately 2/3 as the result of our hedging efforts. As such, if currency rates stay where they are today with the euro at $1.33, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be only a modest headwind to EPS for the full year of 2012.
While first half 2011 cash flow had been impacted by a rise in payables, driven by a large reduction in payables associated with our 2010 annual incentive compensation payout and tax payments, both the results of IFF's strong 2010 financial performance, second half cash flow dramatically improved versus the year-ago period. Our cash flow from operations in Q4 specifically improved $72 million from Q3, even when including the $40 million payment associated with the patent litigation settlement. As a result and as expected, our operating cash flow dramatically improved over the second half of the year.
From a use-of-cash standpoint, capital expenditures, as expected, finished the year near 5% of sales as we made incremental investments in manufacturing capacity in the emerging markets and technologies. We expect that our investments in 2012 to also approximate 5% of sales.
In addition, over the course of 2011, we have paid off $124 million of our outstanding senior notes and, importantly, renewed our credit revolver, both of which we believe will optimize our financial flexibility, going forward.
Finally, as part of our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, we announced in July an increase in the quarterly cash dividend, raising it 15% from $0.27 a quarter to $0.31 a quarter, which we believe underscores our strong financial condition and excellent cash flow position.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on 2012."
281407,145599870,218631,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, Hernan and Nicolas.Looking ahead, we expect local currency sales growth in 2012 to be in line with our long-term targets, albeit at the low end of our 4% to 6% range, as we plan to accelerate the exit from some of our underperforming b",560,"Thank you, Kevin, Hernan and Nicolas.
Looking ahead, we expect local currency sales growth in 2012 to be in line with our long-term targets, albeit at the low end of our 4% to 6% range, as we plan to accelerate the exit from some of our underperforming businesses, more particularly in Flavors. As such, we believe that our team's ability to continue to win new business will be an important driver of our results, going forward.
We do expect some input costs to rise low-single digits in 2012, which will require continued pricing conversations with our customers. It is our expectation, however, that we should reach a gross margin inflection point if raw materials remain at current levels as we approach the second half of 2012.
From an RSA standpoint, we will continue to exhibit disciplined cost control. It should be noted, however, that as our incentive compensation program resets, it will be a headwind should we perform in line with our current targets. In addition, we also plan to make incremental investments in R&D to support future high-value, at-stake initiatives identified in our strategic review. These investments are vital to sustain our long-term growth.
And finally, as Kevin mentioned, if currency rates stay where they are today, with the euro at $1.33, we expect foreign exchange will be a modest headwind for the full year as a result of the hedging program.
Nonetheless, I remain confident in our ability to continue to navigate through these uncertain times as we strive to achieve the long-term targets in 2012.
Looking towards the first quarter, we expect Flavors to deliver good growth, even as they exit low-margin businesses, and Fragrances to be challenged as we continue to see softness in Ingredients and pressures in Fine Fragrance due to the strong year-ago comparison. While we continue to expect greater pricing benefits, the gap between raw material costs and price increases is expected to remain as we are comparing to the lowest-cost period of 2011, although this will improve versus Q4 2011.  As a result, profitability and earnings per share will be under pressure as cost control initiatives are not expected to fully offset our gross margin pressures.
To wrap up. At the beginning of 2011, we expressed optimism that we would continue to perform well despite macroeconomic challenges and unprecedented raw material cost increases. Our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets for the second consecutive year demonstrates the team's aptitude for successfully executing the strategy and navigating through a challenging operating environment.
We continue to leverage our geographic reach to capture the growth potential of the emerging markets, strengthen our innovation platform to deliver differentiating products to customers and maximize our portfolio to improve the underperforming areas of our business.
I'm proud of all of our employees, each of whom played a role in achieving our results, and I remain confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and work with our customers and our internal resources to achieve our long-term targets in 2012.
Longer term, our strategic review has provided insight to management as to the opportunities to further enhance our performance, going forward. Our plan embeds these insights to address the opportunities identified, all of which, we believe, will maximize shareholder value.
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

I mean, it was 16% growth, which was greater than any year in the business, it really was a record year, and also significantly higher growth rate than the industry. If you look at it, it was seventh consecutive quarter of growth and obviously some pressure in the second half. Unfortunately, the difficult comparison as well as price-driven volume declines in Ingredients did put some pressure in the results and especially also in fine, where we had the strongest comp in 2010. So I think that, overall, if you put this thing into perspective and if you look at a 2-year average, I think it's indeed a very, very strong average for the business, being at 8% growth, so in excess of the market. I think what is important as well is our ability to secure new business and also to have access to additional growth potential by entering new colleagues or strengthening our position into some new colleagues. So yes, challenged in the second half, but we believe that most of the key driver was a strong comp. And if you remember also, in Q1 of this year, we were still having some strong growth in the business units and very strong growth in Q4, so therefore, we believe that we have an abnormally high level of pipeline, which affected some of the volume dynamic in the second half."

In terms of the quarter, it was a material benefit for our performance, although I continue to rather talk to the number versus what I would consider to be a normalized level. And I think, in 2011 fourth quarter, that number is plus or minus: I'll give you a general number, it's around $15 million in the quarter versus a normalized level of compensation expense, so there was a benefit to that extent.

I think all the elements are important, as it relates to the financial algorithm necessary to deliver against the objectives. Certainly, top line growth is going to be important, some pricing is going to be important, the management of or the delivery and the savings associated with the recently announced initiative.

We did indicate in the early parts of the year we're going to be under some margin pressure as a function of the costs that we've had, raw material costs, cost in inventory until such time as pricing and efficiencies and other measures capture the margin we need. But it's really, as Kevin said, all parts of the algorithm that are going to get us there but it's really not going to be at the expense of investing in those items that we've deemed critical for the long term, i.e., R&D and some of the innovation and expansion into emerging markets and so on.

Now reviewing our Q1 results. Excluding a 2 percentage point impact related to foreign currency, its diversity and strength of our category and geographic presence allowed us to continue to grow our business as worldwide local currency sales increased 1% in the first quarter, on top of the 9% growth we reported a year ago. 
In Flavors, local currency sales increased 5% or 3% on a reported basis led by the double-digit performance in the emerging markets. If we exclude a 1 percentage point impact associated with unintentional, strategic exit of low-margin businesses in the year ago period, local currency sales on a like-for-like basis or as referred to it, LFL, grew 6%. 
As expected, Fragrance results were pressured by volume declines in ingredients, which had a 300 basis point impact on total local currency Fragrance sales, as well as a challenging year ago comparison with Fine & Beauty Care grew 14% in local currency. 
We were encouraged by the trends seen throughout the quarter as each month improved sequentially, a trend that has continued in the month of April. From a profitability perspective, despite a pricing benefit of nearly 3%, overall gross margin declined 140 basis points due to a 9% increase in raw material costs. This was an improvement relative to the fourth quarter when gross margin was down 220 basis points from the previous year. 
Research, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were down 10 basis points as a result of ongoing cost control and modest benefits from our restructuring. However, as we previously indicated, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS declined versus the prior year period but results are in line with our expectations. 
After Nicolas, Hernan, and Kevin finished their respective sessions, I will give you some perspectives of our outlook for the full year. And with that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter declined 3% as investments wins and pricing benefits were more than offset by volume declines on existing business. 
Volume in Fine & Beauty Care remain pressure down 2% versus 14% growth last year particularly in Western Europe, as we compared to a 2011 period, which included both new wins and volume that were stronger than historical averages. 
Sales in our EMEA region decreased 7% on top of the 22% growth year. However, local currency sales increased 4% in North America, and 5% in Latin America. Fine Beauty Care sales trend improved versus the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily driven by an improved win rate in Fine Fragrance. 
In Functional Fragrance, local currency results were positive, up 1% for the 15th consecutive quarter, as new business wins and the realization of price increases continued to drive results. Sales were up 5% in Europe and 6% in Latin America. Within this segment, Fabric Care remained a standout growing mid-single digits on the local currency basis. 
For Fragrance Ingredients, we continue to focus on driving portfolio management. While we have experienced topline pressure, we've been able to maintain and protect our percent margin on this part of the business. We have been making balanced pricing decisions that have resulted in some of volumes being lost. 
These volumes have been lost where low-margin competitors are pricing to gain share in lower value-added segments of the portfolio. Going forward, our priorities for Ingredients remain: Focusing on technology innovation; product portfolio management; asset optimization; and operations sustainability. 
Given the recent trend in the business, we are also conducting our full assessment of our Ingredient activities following the economic project principal to ensure that we're maximizing our shareholder returns. I expect that this process will take several months at which time we will provide an update. 
From a geographic perspective, trends in the developed market improved lead by North America, which grew 1% driven by increasing a 4% increase in Fine & Beauty Care. Sales in Latin America 2011 were up 5% in Fine & Beauty and up 6% on Functional Fragrances. While not surprising given the strong comparable I just mentioned and the economic situation in Western Europe, EAME sales decreased 5%. 
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, operating profit declined 18% or $30 million to $56 million as double-digit increases in raw material costs and volume declines more than offset higher prices and cost control initiatives. As a result, operating profit margin fell 280 basis points to 15.5% versus a year ago period. 
Looking ahead, we're encouraged that our level of new wins and pipeline of new business should lead to local currency sales growth in the second quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in our compound business. 
It is worth noting, however, that Ingredients is expected to remain under pressure in Q2, similar to our Q1 performance, as a result of our 6 months pricing agreements that were finalizing during Q1 with that a majority of our customers. 
From a pricing perspective, in our compound business, we will continue to up pricing discussion of our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs, a process that I expect we'll be ongoing until we fully recover our input cost increased. 
I would like now to turn the call to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President for Flavors."

Marking the 25th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth, I am pleased to report that the like-for-like local currency sales grew 6%, excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin business on top of the 12 percentage local currency growth, we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Our performance can once again be attributed to new business wins and higher prices across all regions and all categories. 
In North America, like-for-like growth was 5% excluding 2 percentage points related to the exit of low-margin businesses. The best performing category was Beverage, which was up strong double digit, thanks the new wins and increased volumes of prior to using our tools. 
Within our EAME region, local currency growth was led by strong results in Africa and the Middle East. Western Europe continue to remain in positive territory on a local currency basis led by our innovative portfolio but at a slower rate at Africa and the Middle East. In Latin America, local currency growth was strongest in Dairy, up double digits followed by a high single-digit growth in Savory and Beverage. Similar to last quarter, our best performing region in terms of our growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the exit of low-margin business, local currency sales growth was 9% led by a double-digit increase in Confectionery and good growth across Savory and Beverage. 
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, I am very pleased with our performance in the emerging markets, which has grown double-digit on local currency basis for the 10th consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by double-digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Indonesia, India, as well as in some of [indiscernible] regions in Lat Am. 
From an R&D perspective, we expanded our relationship with Evolva Holdings, a biotech company, to implement the commercially biosynthetic fruit for sustainable production of the key flavoring ingredients. We expect this new agreement would leverage the growings we made against our original agreement as we continue to be additional. 
Turning to profit. First quarter of profit increased 1% or $1 million to $18 million, as volume growth, higher pricing and cost disciplines drove results. Operating profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the previous year period to 22.8% due to higher raw material costs. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2012, while we are comparing to our net percent local currency growth rate, we are off to a solid start as new business wins are expected to continue to drive our top line performance. 
With that, let me turn it to Kevin."

First quarter of 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2 percentage point impact on sales.",646,"Thank you, Herman, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter of 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2 percentage point impact on sales. 
Excluding the impact of currencies, local currency sales increased 1%. The emerging markets continue to perform well, up 3% on a local currency basis, on top of the very strong 12% local currency growth we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating profit fell 8% or $11 million to $122 million as pricing actions and cost discipline were more than offset by increases in raw material costs. 
With interest expense declining $1 million and other expenses down approximately $6 million year-over-year, the decline in adjusted operating profit was mitigated at the net income level as adjusted EPS fell 3% to an even $1 in line with our forecast. 
As expected and as communicated on previous calls, our raw material cost remained high in the first quarter of 2012. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most pronounced in Fragrances, where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove a double-digit increase in raw material cost. 
Flavors raw material costs, which were up high-single digits, continued to be impacted by high year-over-year cost of items such as citrus and menthol. As expected, our traction against our pricing actions continued to reduce the gross margin impact on our profitability. As our gross margin shortfall versus the year ago period fell to 140 basis points, versus the 330 and 220 basis points we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. This is a positive trend we will expect to continue over the course of 2012. 
Given that input cost, we're on the line with our expectations and based on current prices, as well as our inventory levels, we expect that Q1 will represent the strongest pressure point in input cost in 2012, as we continue to expect only modest raw material cost inflation for the full year 2012. As a result, our raw material cost comparisons are expected to continue to ease over the balance of the year starting in the second quarter. 
From an overhead cost and point, RSA expense as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 22.9%, reflecting continued cost discipline. Within RSA, we continue to make R&D investments to support our long term strategic growth initiative. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable investment increased year-over-year on both a dollar basis and on a percentage of sales basis.
As I mentioned, foreign exchange in the first quarter had an approximate 2 percentage point impact on the top line, but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our hedging activities. 
Looking ahead, 2/3 of our Eurodollar exposure in 2012 remain hedged at a rate near 140. As such, as currency rates stay where they are today with the Euro in the neighborhood of 130, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be a modest headwind to earnings per share for the full year 2012. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in core working capital. As a result of these improvements, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts and tax payments cash flow from operations increased $88 million from the year ago period to $53 million in the quarter. 
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance and we expect it will approximate 5% of sales for the full year 2012. These investments will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth, with a specific concentration on the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms. 
With that, I like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

Going forward, we expect business trends should improve over the course of the year, as we continue to capitalize on our strong emerging market presence, a healthy research and development pipeline and our profit improvement initiatives. 
In fact, overall, April has proven to be a strong month for both Flavors and Fragrances though Ingredients remained soft. From a top line perspective, Flavors local currency should remain resilient even as we accelerate the exit of low-margin businesses. 
In Fragrance, we expect local currency sales growth starting in Q2 to be driven by strong new wins. As Nicholas was communicated, the 1 area where we see risk to our plan could be an ingredients as current trends remain soft on our external sales portfolio. 
Regarding our margin structure, while we expect raw material cost will rise modestly in 2012, we are seeing pressure beginning to ease, which when combined with our pricing actions, should result in gross margin expansion beginning in Q2 and continuing throughout the balance of the year. 
We expect that this will lead to the third consecutive year of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth even as our incentive compensation program resets, and the continued to make incremental investments in R&D and other parts of the business that are vital to sustain long term profitable growth. 
While we started the year in line with our expectations, the majority of the year is still ahead of us. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic despite the current trends in ingredients and the fluidity in the macroeconomic environment particularly in Western Europe. Both of which, post some risk in achieving our long term financial targets in 2012. 
In wrapping up, we started the year broadly in line with where we thought we would be. Both our Flavors and Fragrance teams have executed the strategy to deliver financial results in line with our expectations. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the evolving macroeconomic landscape. We will proactively manage our performance, making adjustments as necessary as we continue to make progress against our strategic plan. 
With that, we will be happy to take any questions you may have."

Number 2, last year, we saw a significant promotional activity with some customers and did not take place in 2012. And last, important to mention, we also had some inventory correction with a key customer affecting us in particular. So this where the key drivers of the challenges in Q1.

So you can put a shipping to review an extremely in-depth analysis to one of the root causes, what are the implications going forward is there a need to reshape the portfolio, so I guess I'd like in it, to the investor day we had a year ago where we particular that some categories that robust profitability and enhanced emphasis inseminated remediation which is underway to. So in the context of the broad field portfolio, of Fragrance Ingredients that Nicolas just referenced, there maybe some of the size and those of the deemphasize.

He asked that I remind anyone who has follow-up questions to please contact him by e-mail and he will respond as soon as he gets a moment. 
Now reviewing our Q1 results. Excluding a 2-percentage-point impact related to foreign currency, the diversity and the strength of our category and geographic presence allowed us to continue to grow our business as worldwide local currency sales increased 1% in the first quarter, on top of the 9% growth we reported a year ago. 
In Flavors, local currency sales increased 5%, or 3% on a reported basis, led by the double-digit performance in the emerging markets. If we exclude a 1-percentage-point impact associated with unintentional, strategic exit of low-margin businesses in the year ago period, local currency sales on a like-for-like basis, or as was refer to it, LFL, grew 6%. 
As expected, Fragrance results were pressured by volume declines in ingredients, which had a 300-basis-point impact on total local currency Fragrance sales, as well as a challenging year ago comparison when Fine & Beauty Care grew 14% in local currency. 
We were encouraged by the trends seen throughout the quarter as each month improved sequentially, a trend that has continued in the month of April. From a profitability perspective, despite a pricing benefit of nearly 3%, overall gross margin declined 140 basis points due to a 9% increase in raw material costs. This was an improvement relative to the fourth quarter when gross margin was down 220 basis points from the previous year. 
Research, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were down 10 basis points as a result of ongoing cost control and modest benefits from our restructuring. However, as we have previously indicated, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS declined versus the prior year period, but results are in line with our expectations. 
After Nicolas, Hernan, and Kevin finish their respective sections, I will give you some perspectives on our outlook for the full year.

Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter dec",601,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter declined 3% as new business wins and pricing benefits were more than offset by volume declines on existing business. 
Volume in Fine & Beauty Care remained under pressure, down 2% versus 14% growth last year, particularly in Western Europe, as we compared to a 2011 period, which included both new wins and volume that was stronger than historical averages. 
Sales in our EAME region decreased 7% on top of the 22% growth year. However, local currency sales increased 4% in North America, and 5% in Latin America. Fine & Beauty Care sales trend improved versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an improved win rate in Fine Fragrance. 
In Functional Fragrance, local currency results were positive, up 1% for the 15th consecutive quarter, as new business wins and the realization of price increases continued to drive results. Sales were up 5% in Europe and 6% in Latin America. Within this segment, Fabric Care remained a standout, growing mid-single digits on a local currency basis. 
For Fragrance Ingredients, we continued to focus on driving portfolio management. While we have experienced top line pressure, we have been able to maintain and protect our percent margin on the external part of our business. We have been making balanced pricing decisions that have resulted in some volumes being lost. These volumes have been lost, where our low-margin competitors are pricing to gain share in lower value-added segments of their portfolio. 
Going forward, our priorities for Ingredients remain: focusing on technology innovation; product portfolio management; asset optimization; and operations sustainability. 
Given the recent trends in the business, we are also conducting our full assessment of our Ingredient activities following the economic profit principle to ensure that we are maximizing our shareholder returns. I expect that this process will take several months at which time we will provide an update. 
From a geographic perspective, trends in the developed market improved, led by North America, which grew 1%, driven by a 4% increase in Fine & Beauty Care. Sales in Latin America were up 5% in Fine & Beauty and up 6% on Functional Fragrances. While not surprising given the strong comparable I just mentioned and the economic situation in Western Europe, EAME sales decreased 5%. 
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, operating profit declined 18%, or $13 million, to $56 million as double-digit increases in raw material costs and volume declines more than offset higher prices and cost control initiatives. As a result, operating profit margin fell 280 basis points to 15.5% versus a year ago period. 
Looking ahead, we're encouraged that our level of new wins and pipeline of new business should lead to local currency sales growth in the second quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in our compound business. 
It is worth noting, however, that Ingredients is expected to remain under pressure in Q2, similar to our Q1 performance, as a result of our 6 months pricing agreements that were finalized during Q1 with a majority of our customers. 
From a pricing perspective, in our compound business, we will continue to up pricing discussion of our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs, a process that I expect will be ongoing until we fully recover our input cost increase.
I would like now to turn the call to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President for Flavors."

Marking the 25th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth, I am pleased to report that the like-for-like local currency sales grew 6%, excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-marg",455,"Thank you, Nicholas. Marking the 25th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth, I am pleased to report that the like-for-like local currency sales grew 6%, excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin business on top of the 12% local currency growth we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Our performance can once again be attributed to new business win and higher prices across all regions and all categories. 
In North America, like-for-like growth was 5%, excluding 2 percentage points related to the exit of low-margin businesses. The best performing category was Beverage, which was up strong double digits, thanks to new wins and increased volumes of products using our sweetness tools. 
Within our EAME region, local currency growth was led by strong results in Africa and the Middle East. Western Europe continued to remain in positive territory on a local currency basis, led by our innovative naturals portfolio but at a slower rate than Africa and the Middle East. In Latin America, local currency growth was strongest in Dairy, up double digits, followed by a high single-digit growth in Savory and Beverage. 
Similar to last quarter, our best performing region in terms of dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the exit of low-margin business, local currency sales growth was 9%, led by a double-digit increase in Confectionery and good growth across Savory and Beverage. 
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, I am very pleased with our performance in the emerging markets, which has grown double digits on local currency basis for the 10th consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by a double-digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Indonesia, India, as well as in South Con [ph] and Nam and Pac [ph] regions in Lat Am. 
From an R&D perspective, we expanded our relationship with Evolva Holdings, a Swiss biotech company, to implement a commercially biosynthetic fruit for the sustainable production of a key flavoring ingredient. We expect this new agreement would leverage the terms we've made against our original agreement as we continue to be additional. 
Turning to profit. First quarter operating profit increased 1%, or $1 million, to $80 million, as volume growth, higher pricing and cost disciplines drove results. Operating profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior year period to 22.8% due to higher raw material costs. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2012, while we are comparing to our net percent local currency growth rate, we are off to a solid start as the new business wins are expected to continue to drive our top line performance. 
With that, let me turn it to Kevin."

First quarter of 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales.",640,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter of 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales. 
Excluding the impact of currencies, local currency sales increased 1%. The emerging markets continued to perform well, up 3% on a local currency basis, on top of the very strong 12% local currency sales growth we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating profit fell 8%, or $11 million, to $122 million as pricing actions and cost discipline were more than offset by increases in raw material costs. 
With interest expense declining $1 million and other expenses down approximately $6 million year-over-year, the decline in adjusted operating profit was mitigated at the net income level as adjusted EPS fell 3% to an even $1, in line with our forecast. 
As expected and as communicated on previous calls, our raw material costs remained high in the first quarter of 2012. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most pronounced in Fragrances, where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove a double-digit increase in raw material cost. 
Flavors raw material costs, which were up high-single digits, continued to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost of items such as citrus and menthol. As expected, our traction against our pricing actions continued to reduce the gross margin impact on our profitability, as our gross margin shortfall versus the year ago period fell to 140 basis points versus the 330 and 220 basis points we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. This is a positive trend we will expect to continue over the course of 2012. 
Given that input costs were in line with our expectations and based on current prices, as well as our inventory levels, we expect that Q1 will represent the strongest pressure point in input costs in 2012, as we continue to expect only modest raw material cost inflation for the full year 2012. As a result, our raw material costs comparisons are expected to continue to ease over the balance of the year starting in the second quarter. 
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 22.9%, reflecting continued cost discipline. Within RSA, we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable investment increased year-over-year on both a dollar basis and on a percentage of sales basis.
As I mentioned, foreign exchange in the first quarter had an approximate 2-percentage-point impact on the top line but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our hedging activities. 
Looking ahead, 2/3 of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 1.40. As such, as currency rates stay where they are today with the euro in the neighborhood of $1.30, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be a modest headwind to earnings per share for the full year 2012. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in core working capital. As a result of these improvements, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts and tax payments, cash flow from operations increased $88 million from the year ago period to $53 million in the quarter. 
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance, and we expect it will approximate 5% of sales for the full year 2012. These investments will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth, with a specific concentration in the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

Going forward, we expect business trends should improve over the course of the year, as we continue to capitalize on our strong emerging market presence, a healthy research and development pipeline and our profit improvement initiatives. 
In fact, overall, April has proven to be a strong month for both Flavors and Fragrances, though Ingredients remained soft. From a top line perspective, Flavors' local currency should remain resilient even as we accelerate the exit of low-margin businesses. 
In Fragrance, we expect local currency sales growth starting in Q2 to be driven by strong new wins. As Nicolas communicated, the one area where we see risk to our plan could be in Ingredients as current trends remain soft on our external sales portfolio. 
Regarding our margin structure, while we expect raw material costs will rise modestly in 2012, we are seeing pressure beginning to ease, which when combined with our pricing actions, should result in gross margin expansion beginning in Q2 and continuing throughout the balance of the year. 
We expect that this will lead to the third consecutive year of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth, even as our incentive compensation program resets, and we continue to make incremental investments in R&D and other parts of the business that are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth. 
While we started the year in line with our expectations, the majority of the year is still ahead of us. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic despite the current trends in Ingredients and the fluidity in the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Western Europe, both of which post some risks in our achieving our long term financial targets in 2012. 
In wrapping up, we have started the year broadly in line with where we thought we would be. Both our Flavors and Fragrance teams have executed the strategy to deliver financial results in line with our expectations. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the evolving macroeconomic landscape. We will proactively manage our performance, making adjustments as necessary as we continue to make progress against our strategic plan. 
With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have."

Well, I don't think anything has really meaningfully changed, Mark, versus where we were before. I make that with one caveat that we're probably as perplexed as the rest of the world about what might evolve in Europe, particularly Western Europe. It remains a little bit of a cloud over our heads and our customers' head. But putting that part aside, the Q1 came in, in line with expectations in volume and profitability, in EPS. We think we're probably closer to the lower end of the sales guidance range we've given. And as I've just mentioned, we think there's some risk to the long-term financial EPS target. But relative to what our comments would have been, we wouldn't be meaningfully different, absent the caveat I've given about Western Europe. I think the embellishment I would provide on it is the expectation that both comparables are easing, or as the overall situation now as we see it in cost of goods and raw material impacts is easing, the pipeline we have in terms of R&D wins, the customer wins is solid and the R&D pipeline remains robust.

One of the points you'd raised, Jeff, was is there a capacity change in the industry and which could be a driving force and implication going forward? And that's one of the areas we're frankly investigating right now. Early signs suggest there might be some legitimacy to that. So when you have a couple of quarters or 3 quarters of softness that we've had in the order of double-digit, it frankly is very much on the radar screen in both management and our board. So you can call it a strategic review or an extremely in-depth analysis to, what are the root causes? What are the implications going forward? Is there a need to reshape the portfolio? I guess I'd liken it analogous to the Investor Day we had a year ago, where articulated some categories had robust profitability and wouldn't get enhanced emphasis, and some needed remediation, which is underway, too. So in the context of the broad field portfolio, of Fragrance Ingredients that Nicolas just referenced, there maybe some of those that we emphasize and those of the de-emphasize. So that's kind of the -- and the other one final comment would be in this very price-sensitive environment, we saw some customers opt for a lower-priced alternative, and as Nicolas said, we retained the margin by pricing up, which has cost the less [indiscernible]  to be a little more negative than we'd first thought."

Now reviewing our Q1 results. Excluding a 2-percentage-point impact related to foreign currency, the diversity and the strength of our category and geographic presence allowed us to continue to grow our business as worldwide local currency sales increased 1% in the first quarter, on top of the 9% growth we reported a year ago. 
In Flavors, local currency sales increased 5%, or 3% on a reported basis, led by double-digit performance in the emerging markets. If we exclude a 1 percentage point impact associated with an intentional, strategic exit of low-margin businesses in the year ago period, local currency sales on a like-for-like basis, or as we refer to it, LFL, grew 6%. 
As expected, Fragrance results were pressured by volume declines in ingredients, which had a 300-basis-point impact on total local currency Fragrance sales, as well as a challenging year ago comparison when Fine & Beauty Care grew 14% in local currency. 
We were encouraged by the trends seen throughout the quarter as each month improved sequentially, a trend that has continued in the month of April. From a profitability perspective, despite a pricing benefit of nearly 3%, overall gross margin declined 140 basis points due to a 9% increase in raw material costs. This was an improvement relative to the fourth quarter when gross margin was down 220 basis points from the previous year. 
Research, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were down 10 basis points as a result of ongoing cost control and modest benefits from our restructuring. However, as we have previously indicated, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS declined versus the prior year period, but results are in line with our expectations. 
After Nicolas, Hernan and Kevin finish their respective sections, I will give you some perspectives on our outlook for the full year. 
And with that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter dec",602,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter declined 3% as new business wins and pricing benefits were more than offset by volume declines on existing business. 
Volume in Fine & Beauty Care remained under pressure, down 2% versus 14% growth last year, particularly in Western Europe, as we compared to a 2011 period which included both new wins and volume that was stronger than historical averages. 
Sales in our EAME region decreased 7% on top of 22% growth last year. However, local currency sales increased 4% in North America, and 5% in Latin America. Fine & Beauty Care sales trend improved versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an improved win rate in Fine Fragrance. 
In Functional Fragrance, local currency results were positive, up 1% for the 15th consecutive quarter, as new business wins and the realization of price increases continued to drive results. Sales were up 5% in Europe and 6% in Latin America. Within this segment, Fabric Care remained a standout, growing mid-single digits on the local currency basis. 
For Fragrance Ingredients, we continued to focus on driving portfolio management. While we have experienced top line pressure, we have been able to maintain and protect our percent margin on the external part of our business. We have been making balanced pricing decisions that have resulted in some volumes being lost. These volumes have been lost where our low-margin competitors are pricing to gain share in lower value-added segments of their portfolio. 
Going forward, our priorities for Ingredients remain: focusing on technology innovation; product portfolio management; asset optimization; and operations sustainability. 
Given the recent trend in the business, we are also conducting a full assessment of our Ingredient activities following the economic profit principle to ensure that we are maximizing our shareholder returns. I expect that this process will take several months at which time we will provide an update. 
From a geographic perspective, trends in the developed market improved, led by North America, which grew 1%, driven by a 4% increase in Fine & Beauty Care. Sales in Latin America were up 5% in Fine & Beauty and up 6% on Functional Fragrances. While not surprising given the strong comparable I just mentioned and the economic situation in Western Europe, EAME sales decreased 5%. 
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, operating profit declined 18%, or $13 million, to $56 million as double-digit increases in raw material costs and volume declines more than offset higher prices and cost control initiatives. As a result, operating profit margin fell 280 basis points to 15.5% versus a year ago period. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged that our level of new wins and pipeline of new business should lead to local currency sales growth in the second quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in our compound business. 
It is worth noting, however, that Ingredients is expected to remain under pressure in Q2, similar to our Q1 performance, as a result of our 6 months pricing agreements that were finalized during Q1 with a majority of our customers. 
From a pricing perspective, in our compound business, we will continue to have pricing discussion with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs, a process that I expect will be ongoing until we fully recover our input cost increase.
I would like now to turn the call to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President for Flavors."

Marking the 25th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth, I am pleased to report that the like-for-like local currency sales grew 6%, excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin business on top of the 12% local currency growth we reported in the first quarter, 2011. Our performance can once again be attributed to new business win and higher prices across all regions and all categories. 
In North America, like-for-like growth was 5%, excluding 2 percentage points related to the exit of low-margin businesses. The best performing category was Beverage, which was up strong double digits, thanks to new wins and increased volumes of products used in our sweetness tools. 
Within our EAME region, local currency growth was led by strong results in Africa and the Middle East. Western Europe continued to remain in positive territory on a local currency basis, led by our innovative naturals portfolio but at a slower rate than Africa and the Middle East. In Latin America, local currency growth was strongest in Dairy, up double digits, followed by high single-digit growth in Savory and Beverage. 
Similar to last quarter, our best performing region in terms of dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the exit of low-margin business, local currency sales growth was 9%, led by a double-digit increase in Confectionery and good growth across Savory and Beverage. 
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, I am very pleased with our performance in the emerging markets, which has grown double digits on local currency basis for the 10th consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by a double-digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Indonesia, India, as well as in South Con [ph] and Nam and Pac [ph] regions in LatAm. 
From an R&D perspective, we expanded our relationship with Evolva Holdings, a Swiss biotech company, to implement a commercially  [indiscernible] biosynthetic route for the sustainable production of a key flavoring ingredient. We expect this new agreement would leverage the progress we've made against our original agreement as we continue to build additional [Audio Gap].
Turning to profit. First quarter operating profit increased 1%, or $1 million, to $80 million, as volume growth, higher pricing and cost disciplines drove results. Operating profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior year period to 22.8% due to higher raw material costs. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2012, while we are comparing to our net percent local currency growth rate, we are off to a solid start as new business wins are expected to continue to drive our top line performance. 
With that, let me turn it to Kevin."

First quarter 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales. E",641,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales. 
Excluding the impact of currencies, local currency sales increased 1%. The emerging markets continued to perform well, up 3% on a local currency basis, on top of the very strong 12% local currency sales growth we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating profit fell 8%, or $11 million, to $122 million as pricing actions and cost discipline were more than offset by increases in raw material costs. 
With interest expense declining $1 million and other expenses down approximately $6 million year-over-year, the decline in adjusted operating profit was mitigated at the net income level as adjusted EPS fell 3% to an even $1, in line with our forecast. 
As expected and as communicated on previous calls, our raw material costs remained high in the first quarter of 2012. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most pronounced in Fragrances, where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove a double-digit increase in raw material cost. 
Flavors raw material costs, which were up high-single digits, continued to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost of items such as citrus and mint and menthol. As expected, our traction against our pricing actions continued to reduce the gross margin impact on our profitability, as our gross margin shortfall versus the year ago period fell to 140 basis points versus the 330 and 220 basis points we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. This is a positive trend we will expect to continue over the course of 2012. 
Given that input costs were in line with our expectations, and based on current prices as well as our inventory levels, we expect that Q1 will represent the strongest pressure point in input costs in 2012, as we continue to expect only modest raw material cost inflation for the full year 2012. As a result, our raw material cost comparisons are expected to continue to ease over the balance of the year starting in the second quarter. 
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 22.9%, reflecting continued cost discipline. Within RSA, we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable investment increased year-over-year on both a dollar basis and on a percentage of sales basis.
As I mentioned, foreign exchange in the first quarter had an approximate 2-percentage-point impact on the top line but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our hedging activities. 
Looking ahead, 2/3 of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 140. As such, as currency rates stay where they are today with the euro in the neighborhood of $1.30, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be a modest headwind to earnings per share for the full year 2012. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in core working capital. As a result of these improvements, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts and tax payments, cash flow from operations increased $88 million from the year ago period to $53 million in the quarter. 
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance, and we expect it will approximate 5% of sales for the full year 2012. These investments will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth, with a specific concentration in the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

Going forward, we expect business trends should improve over the course of the year, as we continue to capitalize on our strong emerging market presence, a healthy research and development pipeline and our profit improvement initiatives. 
In fact, overall, April has proven to be a strong month for both Flavors and Fragrances, though Ingredients remained soft. From a top line perspective, Flavors' local currency should remain resilient even as we accelerate the exit of low-margin businesses. 
In Fragrance, we expect local currency sales growth starting in Q2 to be driven by strong new wins. As Nicolas communicated, the one area where we see risk to our plan could be in Ingredients as current trends remain soft on our external sales portfolio. 
Regarding our margin structure, while we expect raw material costs will rise modestly in 2012, we are seeing pressure beginning to ease, which when combined with our pricing actions, should result in gross margin expansion beginning in Q2 and continuing throughout the balance of the year. 
We expect that this will lead to the third consecutive year of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth, even as our incentive compensation program resets, and we continue to make incremental investments in R&D and other parts of the business that are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth. 
While we started the year in line with our expectations, the majority of the year is still ahead of us. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic despite the current trends in Ingredients and the fluidity in the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Western Europe, both of which pose some risk in our achieving our long term financial targets in 2012. 
In wrapping up, we have started the year broadly in line with where we thought we would be. Both our Flavors and Fragrance teams have executed the strategy to deliver financial results in line with our expectations. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the evolving macroeconomic landscape. We will proactively manage our performance, making adjustments as necessary as we continue to make progress against our strategic plan. 
With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have."

I make that with one caveat, that we're probably as perplexed as the rest of the world about what might evolve in Europe, particularly Western Europe. It remains a little bit of a cloud over our heads and our customers' heads. But putting that part aside, the Q1 came in, in line with expectations in volume and profitability, in EPS. We think we're probably closer to the lower end of the sales guidance range we've given. And as I've just mentioned, we think there's some risk to the long-term financial EPS target. But relative to what our comments would have been, we wouldn't be meaningfully different, absent the caveat I've just given about Western Europe. I think the embellishment I would provide on it is the expectation that both comparables are easing, or as the overall situation now as we see it in cost of goods and raw material impacts is easing, the pipeline we have in terms of R&D wins, the customer wins is solid and the R&D pipeline remains robust.

We think we've got extremely robust comparables to go up against, which we've just reported upon. So we'd probably look at the longer-term, Mark, and say, do we have the level of wins underway with customers? Is there a level of customer intimacy we need to have to make sure we win?

One of the points you'd raised, Jeff, was is there a capacity change in the industry and which could be a driving force and implication going forward? And that's one of the areas we're frankly investigating right now. Early signs suggest there might be some legitimacy to that. So when you have the couple of quarters or 3 quarters of softness that we've had, in the order of double-digit, it frankly is very much on the radar screen of both management and our board. So you can call it a strategic review or an extremely in-depth analysis to what are the root causes? What are the implications going forward? Is there a need to reshape the portfolio? I guess I'd liken it, analogous to the Investor Day we had a year ago, where we articulated some categories had robust profitability and would hence get enhanced emphasis, and some needed remediation, which is underway, too. So in the context of the broad-scale portfolio of Fragrance Ingredients that Nicolas just referenced, there maybe some of those that we emphasize and those that we de-emphasize. So that's kind of the -- and the other one final comment would be in this very price-sensitive environment, we saw some customers opt for a lower-priced alternative, and as Nicolas said, we retained the margin by pricing up, which has caused the elasticity to be a little more negative than we'd first thought."

Now reviewing our Q1 results. Excluding a 2-percentage-point impact related to foreign currency, the diversity and the strength of our category and geographic presence allowed us to continue to grow our business as worldwide local currency sales increased 1% in the first quarter, on top of the 9% growth we reported a year ago. 
In Flavors, local currency sales increased 5%, or 3% on a reported basis, led by double-digit performance in the emerging markets. If we exclude a 1 percentage point impact associated with an intentional, strategic exit of low-margin businesses in the year ago period, local currency sales on a like-for-like basis, or as we refer to it, LFL, grew 6%. 
As expected, Fragrance results were pressured by volume declines in ingredients, which had a 300-basis-point impact on total local currency Fragrance sales, as well as a challenging year ago comparison when Fine & Beauty Care grew 14% in local currency. 
We were encouraged by the trends seen throughout the quarter as each month improved sequentially, a trend that has continued in the month of April. From a profitability perspective, despite a pricing benefit of nearly 3%, overall gross margin declined 140 basis points due to a 9% increase in raw material costs. This was an improvement relative to the fourth quarter when gross margin was down 220 basis points from the previous year. 
Research, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were down 10 basis points as a result of ongoing cost control and modest benefits from our restructuring. However, as we have previously indicated, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS declined versus the prior year period, but results are in line with our expectations. 
After Nicolas, Hernan and Kevin finish their respective sections, I will give you some perspectives on our outlook for the full year. 
And with that, I would like to introduce our group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

Comparing to a 7% local currency growth rate in the year ago period, which was a record first quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in 2011, local currency sales in the first quarter declined 3% as new business wins and pricing benefits were more than offset by volume declines on existing business. 
Volume in Fine & Beauty Care remained under pressure, down 2% versus 14% growth last year, particularly in Western Europe, as we compared to a 2011 period which included both new wins and volume that was stronger than historical averages. 
Sales in our EAME region decreased 7% on top of 22% growth last year. However, local currency sales increased 4% in North America, and 5% in Latin America. Fine & Beauty Care sales trend improved versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an improved win rate in Fine Fragrance. 
In Functional Fragrance, local currency results were positive, up 1% for the 15th consecutive quarter, as new business wins and the realization of price increases continued to drive results. Sales were up 5% in Europe and 6% in Latin America. Within this segment, Fabric Care remained a standout, growing mid-single digits on the local currency basis. 
For Fragrance Ingredients, we continued to focus on driving portfolio management. While we have experienced top line pressure, we have been able to maintain and protect our percent margin on the external part of our business. We have been making balanced pricing decisions that have resulted in some volumes being lost. These volumes have been lost where our low-margin competitors are pricing to gain share in lower value-added segments of their portfolio. 
Going forward, our priorities for Ingredients remain: focusing on technology innovation; product portfolio management; asset optimization; and operations sustainability. 
Given the recent trend in the business, we are also conducting a full assessment of our Ingredient activities following the economic profit principle to ensure that we are maximizing our shareholder returns. I expect that this process will take several months at which time we will provide an update. 
From a geographic perspective, trends in the developed market improved, led by North America, which grew 1%, driven by a 4% increase in Fine & Beauty Care. Sales in Latin America were up 5% in Fine & Beauty and up 6% on Functional Fragrances. While not surprising given the strong comparable I just mentioned and the economic situation in Western Europe, EAME sales decreased 5%. 
From a profitability standpoint, as expected, operating profit declined 18%, or $13 million, to $56 million as double-digit increases in raw material costs and volume declines more than offset higher prices and cost control initiatives. As a result, operating profit margin fell 280 basis points to 15.5% versus a year ago period. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged that our level of new wins and pipeline of new business should lead to local currency sales growth in the second quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in our compound business. 
It is worth noting, however, that Ingredients is expected to remain under pressure in Q2, similar to our Q1 performance, as a result of our 6 months pricing agreements that were finalized during Q1 with a majority of our customers. 
From a pricing perspective, in our compound business, we will continue to have pricing discussion with our customers to reduce the impact of higher raw material costs, a process that I expect will be ongoing until we fully recover our input cost increase.
I would like now to turn the call to Hernan Vaisman, our Group President for Flavors."

Marking the 25th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth, I am pleased to report that the like-for-like local currency sales grew 6%, excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin business on top of the 12% local currency growth we reported in the first quarter, 2011. Our performance can once again be attributed to new business win and higher prices across all regions and all categories. 
In North America, like-for-like growth was 5%, excluding 2 percentage points related to the exit of low-margin businesses. The best performing category was Beverage, which was up strong double digits, thanks to new wins and increased volumes of products used in our sweetness tools. 
Within our EAME region, local currency growth was led by strong results in Africa and the Middle East. Western Europe continued to remain in positive territory on a local currency basis, led by our innovative naturals portfolio but at a slower rate than Africa and the Middle East. In Latin America, local currency growth was strongest in Dairy, up double digits, followed by high single-digit growth in Savory and Beverage. 
Similar to last quarter, our best performing region in terms of dollar growth and percentage change continues to be Greater Asia. Excluding approximately 1 percentage point associated with the exit of low-margin business, local currency sales growth was 9%, led by a double-digit increase in Confectionery and good growth across Savory and Beverage. 
Looking at the geographic breakdown of our sales, I am very pleased with our performance in the emerging markets, which has grown double digits on local currency basis for the 10th consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by a double-digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Indonesia, India, as well as in South Con [ph] and many impacted regions in LatAm. 
From an R&D perspective, we expanded our relationship with Evolva Holdings, a Swiss biotech company, to implement a commercially viable biosynthetic route for the sustainable production of a key flavoring ingredient. We expect this new agreement would leverage the progress we've made against our original agreement as we continue to build additional competitive advantages.
Turning to profit. First quarter operating profit increased 1%, or $1 million, to $80 million, as volume growth, higher pricing and cost disciplines drove results. Operating profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior year period to 22.8% due to higher raw material costs. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2012, while we are comparing to our net percent local currency growth rate, we are off to a solid start as new business wins are expected to continue to drive our top line performance. 
With that, let me turn it to Kevin."

First quarter 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales. E",641,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter 2012 reported sales totaled $711 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period, as the impact of foreign exchange had a negative 2-percentage-point impact on sales. 
Excluding the impact of currencies, local currency sales increased 1%. The emerging markets continued to perform well, up 3% on a local currency basis, on top of the very strong 12% local currency sales growth we reported in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted operating profit fell 8%, or $11 million, to $122 million as pricing actions and cost discipline were more than offset by increases in raw material costs. 
With interest expense declining $1 million and other expenses down approximately $6 million year-over-year, the decline in adjusted operating profit was mitigated at the net income level as adjusted EPS fell 3% to an even $1, in line with our forecast. 
As expected and as communicated on previous calls, our raw material costs remained high in the first quarter of 2012. While both businesses faced significant cost pressure, it was most pronounced in Fragrances, where strong increases in naturals, petrochemicals and feedstock ingredients drove a double-digit increase in raw material cost. 
Flavors raw material costs, which were up high-single digits, continued to be impacted by higher year-over-year cost of items such as citrus and mint and menthol. As expected, our traction against our pricing actions continued to reduce the gross margin impact on our profitability, as our gross margin shortfall versus the year ago period fell to 140 basis points versus the 330 and 220 basis points we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. This is a positive trend we will expect to continue over the course of 2012. 
Given that input costs were in line with our expectations, and based on current prices as well as our inventory levels, we expect that Q1 will represent the strongest pressure point in input costs in 2012, as we continue to expect only modest raw material cost inflation for the full year 2012. As a result, our raw material cost comparisons are expected to continue to ease over the balance of the year starting in the second quarter. 
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 22.9%, reflecting continued cost discipline. Within RSA, we continue to make R&D investments to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and incentive compensation expense from both periods, our comparable investment increased year-over-year on both a dollar basis and on a percentage of sales basis.
As I mentioned, foreign exchange in the first quarter had an approximate 2-percentage-point impact on the top line but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our hedging activities. 
Looking ahead, 2/3 of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 140. As such, as currency rates stay where they are today with the euro in the neighborhood of $1.30, we expect foreign exchange impacts to be a modest headwind to earnings per share for the full year 2012. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to make improvements in core working capital. As a result of these improvements, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts and tax payments, cash flow from operations increased $88 million from the year ago period to $53 million in the quarter. 
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance, and we expect it will approximate 5% of sales for the full year 2012. These investments will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth, with a specific concentration in the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

Going forward, we expect business trends should improve over the course of the year, as we continue to capitalize on our strong emerging market presence, a healthy research and development pipeline and our profit improvement initiatives. 
In fact, overall, April has proven to be a strong month for both Flavors and Fragrances, though Ingredients remained soft. From a top line perspective, Flavors' local currency should remain resilient even as we accelerate the exit of low-margin businesses. 
In Fragrance, we expect local currency sales growth starting in Q2 to be driven by strong new wins. As Nicolas communicated, the one area where we see risk to our plan could be in Ingredients as current trends remain soft on our external sales portfolio. 
Regarding our margin structure, while we expect raw material costs will rise modestly in 2012, we are seeing pressure beginning to ease, which when combined with our pricing actions, should result in gross margin expansion beginning in Q2 and continuing throughout the balance of the year. 
We expect that this will lead to the third consecutive year of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth, even as our incentive compensation program resets, and we continue to make incremental investments in R&D and other parts of the business that are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth. 
While we started the year in line with our expectations, the majority of the year is still ahead of us. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic despite the current trends in Ingredients and the fluidity in the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Western Europe, both of which pose some risk in our achieving our long term financial targets in 2012. 
In wrapping up, we have started the year broadly in line with where we thought we would be. Both our Flavors and Fragrance teams have executed the strategy to deliver financial results in line with our expectations. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the evolving macroeconomic landscape. We will proactively manage our performance, making adjustments as necessary as we continue to make progress against our strategic plan. 
With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have."

Well, I don't think anything has really meaningfully changed, Mark, versus where we were before. I make that with one caveat, that we're probably as perplexed as the rest of the world about what might evolve in Europe, particularly Western Europe. It remains a little bit of a cloud over our heads and our customers' heads. But putting that part aside, the Q1 came in, in line with expectations in volume and profitability, in EPS. We think we're probably closer to the lower end of the sales guidance range we've given. And as I've just mentioned, we think there's some risk to the long-term financial EPS target. But relative to what our comments would have been, we wouldn't be meaningfully different, absent the caveat I've just given about Western Europe. I think the embellishment I would provide on it is the expectation that both comparables are easing, or as the overall situation now as we see it in cost of goods and raw material impacts is easing, the pipeline we have in terms of R&D wins, the customer wins is solid and the R&D pipeline remains robust.

We think we've got extremely robust comparables to go up against, which we've just reported upon. So we'd probably look at the longer-term, Mark, and say, do we have the level of wins underway with customers? Is there a level of customer intimacy we need to have to make sure we win?

So when you have the couple of quarters or 3 quarters of softness that we've had, in the order of double-digit, it frankly is very much on the radar screen of both management and our board. So you can call it a strategic review or an extremely in-depth analysis to what are the root causes? What are the implications going forward? Is there a need to reshape the portfolio? I guess I'd liken it, analogous to the Investor Day we had a year ago, where we articulated some categories had robust profitability and would hence get enhanced emphasis, and some needed remediation, which is underway, too. So in the context of the broad-scale portfolio of Fragrance Ingredients that Nicolas just referenced, there maybe some of those that we emphasize and those that we de-emphasize. So that's kind of the -- and the other one final comment would be in this very price-sensitive environment, we saw some customers opt for a lower-priced alternative, and as Nicolas said, we retained the margin by pricing up, which has caused the elasticity to be a little more negative than we'd first thought."

We are pleased with our performance this quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic challenges presented by the ongoing difficulties in Western Europe and external sales volume declines in our Fragrance Ingredients business. Despite these challenges, we were able to deliver solid top line growth and even stronger double-digit earnings per share growth due to our efforts to diversify our revenue base, focus on our customers and control our costs.
Our diversity in terms of our customers, our end-use categories and our geographic footprint allowed us to continue to grow our business this quarter and deliver local currency sales growth of 4% and on a like-for-like basis, local currency sales growth of 5%. The growth we achieved this quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2011 is due to the momentum we have established in many areas of the business. Our global reach and our customer intimacy enable us to better serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities that are available today for market share growth.
IFF’s growth this quarter was driven by our Flavors business, which delivered 8% local currency growth on top of 8% local currency growth in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year performance reflects the balanced and the consistent nature of our business, and a strong and growing presence we have in emerging markets. We also saw growth in our Fragrance Compounds business this quarter, which delivered 6% local currency sales growth.
Solid growth in both the Fine & Beauty Care and the Functional Fragrance categories offset continued erosion in Ingredients. Nicolas Mirzayantz will provide more details on our Ingredients business later in the call. As anticipated this quarter was an inflection point for our business in terms of volume, costs and profitability and we are pleased with the results.
Raw material cost increases started to ease this quarter. However, they remain at high levels. As you know, raw material prices have been increasing for the last five quarters on average by 11% each quarter. We have been able to mitigate this inflation through pricing resulting in a more favorable relationship between raw material price increases and pricing this quarter.
Our other margin enhancing efforts including cost efficiencies and volume leverage when combined with pricing led to gross margins expanding 210 basis points to 41.8% this quarter versus 39.7% in the year-ago and 40.2% in the first quarter of 2012. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $132.3 million driven by gross margin expansion and our cost management discipline. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 18.3% of sales from the second quarter of 2011.
Our enhanced operating profit combined with lower interest expense and other income and expense gains resulted in our ability to achieve earnings per share of $1.08 this quarter. We are able to achieve these results off of modest top line growth due to a continued focus on margin improvement opportunities, which include the exit of low-margin business that Hernan will talk to.
We’ll now turn the call over to Hernan and Nicolas, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin Berryman, our CFO who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sessions, I will give you some perspective on our outlook for the balance of the year.
I would now like to introduce our Group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman.

I am pleased to report that this quarter, the Flavor business delivered 9% local currency growth on a like-for-like basis, which excludes approximately one percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin sales activities, on top of that 8% local currency growth that we delivered in the second quarter of 2011. This is our 26 consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. This quarter, we delivered a strong growth across all regions and categories with sequential growth over the first quarter in every region. Our beverage category achieved double-digit growth this quarter while Savory, Sweet, Dairy also delivered solid growth.
In North America, like-for-like growth was 12% excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities. The best-performing category was once again beverage, which was up strong double-digit due to new exciting wins in a steel beverage and other refreshing drinks. Dairy also delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter. We also saw incremental sales related to our sweetness modulation tools. Savory also increased on a like-for-like basis of winning part to savory modulation tools as part of our health and wellness initiatives.
Within our EAME region, like-for-like growth of 8% was led by strong growth in savory. Western Europe continues to be positive territory overall, due to continued strong wins in the market and volume growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East.
In Latin America, local currency growth was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Sweet and a strong growth in Dairy and Beverage. We are looking to improve our sales momentum in Latin America. Greater Asia is our largest region, and once again this region delivered a strong growth with 9% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 10%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet.
As you know, our Flavors business is heavily indexed in the emerging markets, which are growing a bit much faster rate than other areas of the world due to changes in disposable income and lifestyle. People in these markets are not only looking for great, authentic taste and convenience. They are looking for healthier options in the food they eat.
To better support our customers in the emerging markets, we are building new facilities in Singapore and China, and expect to be making announcement of the opening of Singapore later this year and China early next year. We continue to invest in building creative centers that expand our global footprint and put us in closer proximity to our customer base.
In June, we announced the opening of a new facility in Delhi, India to house creative, technical, sensory and sales professionals. This facility will help us to better serve our global and regional customers’ present and future needs and create the best taste for the Indian market. We have an 80 years history in India, and this investment together with our investment in Singapore and China demonstrate our faith and commitment to the region. 
This quarter, Flavors in emerging market achieved double digit increase on a local currency basis for the eleventh consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by double digit local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, as well as strong growth in South Cone and Brazil.
Turning to profit, second quarter segment operating profit increased $10 million or 13.5% to $81 million. The strong volume, driven in part by new wins, favorable mix, pricing increase, the exiting of low margin business and ongoing cost reductions, more than offset rising raw material costs and resulted in increased gross margins. Improved our gross margins more than offset increases in research, selling and admin expenses. 
Operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the previous year to 22.3. This quarter, RSA was negatively affected by a payment to our biotech partner. As we reach a milestone in our collaboration much sooner than expected, we are excited about this collaboration and look forward to telling you more about the project as it evolves. Looking ahead, we expect to see consistent sales growth in the second half of 2012, led by continued momentum in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities, which I expect will be more than twice the levels seen in the first half of this year. 
However, our consistent underlying sales growth remains strong driven by new businesses wins, using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers’ end products healthier. We are excited of our future growth prospect.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances.

For Fragrances in the second quarter of 2012, local currency sales were flat compared with the prior year quarter. Improved pricing, new business wins and favorable product mix were offset by declining ingredients volume. We saw positive trends in many areas of the business, resulting in a sequential improvement over the prior quarter in our Fragrance Compound business.
Local currency sales gross in Fine & Beauty Care increased 4% with strong growth in hair care in all regions and in toiletries especially in Latin America and EAME. The Fine & Beauty category was up 29% in LatAm and 11% in Greater Asia. In Functional Fragrance, we saw strong growth led by fabric care. Local currency sales growth of 7% was positive for the 16 consecutive quarter as new business wins, less erosion in the base business and the realization of price increases continue to drive results.
The Functional Fragrance category was up 11% in Latin America, up 6% in Greater Asia and up 8% in EAME. Our Fragrance Compound business was up 6% overall led by strong growth in Latin America and Greater Asia. This growth reflects the strength of our strategic relationships with our global and regional customers and our long-standing presence in the emerging markets.
Sales from encapsulation technology continued to increase double-digit and supported the growth in our Functional Fragrance business. Unfortunately, we’re facing continued challenges in both Western Europe and in Fragrance Ingredients. 
Our total Fragrance business in EAME had negative local currency growth due to a 4% decline in Fine & Beauty Care and 24% decline in ingredients offset in part by the growth of 8% in Functional Fragrances. Sales in our EAME region were negatively affected by the ongoing Eurozone issues and the effect of economic uncertainty and unemployment on disposable income.
Now, I’d like to say a few words on Fragrance Ingredients since this has been a concern to investors. Over the past year, we have seen continued deterioration on the external sales components of our Fragrance Ingredients business. This has prompted a thorough strategic review of our Ingredients business. 
Unprecedented increases in input cost and the resulting change in both competitive pricing and our customers’ willingness to take additional supply chain risk to minimize their own input cost pressures have resulted in a change in industry dynamics. With the availability of cheaper materials from low price manufacturers in China and India, we are seeing incremental pressure on the top line, particularly in those non-patent protected ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace.
Our strategic review and evaluation of options to improve the overall performance of our Ingredient business has confirmed that the Ingredient business has been and continues to be of strategic value to IFF due to the supply of cost advantage ingredients to our Fragrance Compounds business and the profitable sales of ingredients to external customers at acceptable margins. Overall, we have maintained our gross margin in this business even on the lower volume. 
I want to make clear that we are not looking to close or sell this business based on our current views. However, changes to operating models are required. We are now developing the specifics for how we will execute against the plan that will reduce cost to levels consistent with existing realities of the market. We will be communicating further actions to you at the appropriate time, so as not to impact our competitive positioning and ability to successfully execute.
After four challenging quarters, our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and discipline, improved mix and pricing allowed us to more than offset continued although lower increases in raw material input costs. As a result of these factors, gross margins expanded over the prior year helping support gross margin expansion at the consolidated level and resulted in improved segment operating profit.
Segment operating profit increased 2% or $1 million this quarter to $64 million. Our segment operating margin expended 90 basis points to 17.7%, up from 16.8% a year ago. We expect category and geographic diversification to help mitigate continued volume declines in Fragrance Ingredients. We expect to see continued momentum in Fine & Beauty Care and moderate growth in Functional Fragrance. 
We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as continued traction against our encapsulation technology, but we still must be mindful of potential economic weakness in Europe where economies are under pressure and in ingredients. We also expect continued margin recovery as we continue to implement further increases in pricing and focus on cost efficiencies and cost discipline.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO.

Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4",1475,"Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4%. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of lower margin discontinued sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 5%, reflecting improved sales trends in many parts of our global business.
As you’ve heard from Hernan, Flavors achieved high single-digit growth in every region, an 8% growth overall. This is on top of 8% growth in the year-ago quarter, which speaks to the consistency and stability of this business. Excluding the impact of discontinued business, Flavors growth was 9% led by a long list of new product wins among a diverse set of customers.
In Fragrance, the growth in Fine & Beauty Care and Functional was much improved from the first quarter, although the 6% local currency growth in compounds was offset by volume softness in Ingredients, resulting in flat Fragrance local currency sales growth for the quarter.
I want to saw a few words about our performance in Europe. We have seen some weakness in Western Europe, particularly in those countries as economies are challenged by low growth and high unemployment. Overall, our Flavors business continues to grow, but our Fragrance business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the volume in Western Europe, has been pressured by both the weakness in European economies as well as pressure in Ingredients.
On the positive side, we are not heavily indexed to the countries that are most under economic pressure and even though our volume is somewhat impacted, our geographic diversity has muted the impact. As you know, we have a large geographic footprint in both developed and emerging markets.
We are extremely well indexed in the emerging markets, perhaps better than any of our competitors, but we are seeing emerging market growth of 9% this quarter on a local currency basis led by very high growth in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and Vietnam. The emerging markets represented 48% of our sales in the second quarter, up from 46% of sales in the first quarter, so they continue to grow much faster than the developed markets.
Many of you have been asking about our ingredients progress and I wanted to add a few words to what Nicolas has shared with you about the strategic review. As he said, we are developing a detailed plan for making changes to our business model. I’d like to provide some insight into how that will play out over the near-term.
Due to the complexities of the business, we do not expect to see any material changes to our business in the near-term, especially in the third quarter. However, we do believe our plan will result in a stronger and more sustainable foundation longer-term.
Turning to bottom line growth, adjusted operating profit increased to 8% to $132.3 million this quarter due to pricing actions and volume gains, which more than offset increases in raw material costs and increased incentive compensation accruals.
Interest expense declined to $1.4 million in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt and other income, expenses improved to $1.9 million year-over-year due to favorable exchange gain and losses on outstanding working capital balances.
I’d also like to talk briefly about our second quarter tax rate. This year our effective tax rate was 27.7% versus 27.4% a year-ago. This is primarily due to a reserve adjustment related to one of our tax defaulting cases in Spain. Other provision adjustments on uncertain tax positions and the absence of an R&D tax credit in U.S. during the second quarter of 2012. Despite a slightly higher tax rate of 27.7%, adjusted EPS was still able to increase 11% to $1.08, up from $0.97 in the second quarter of 2011 when excluding restructuring and other charges of $0.04 per share in the prior year quarter.
As expected, and as we discussed on our first quarter conference call, our raw material cost increases started to moderate in the second quarter. As you can see in the slide, material costs were up 5% this quarter, and they are growing at a slower rate than in the second quarter of 2011 when they were impacted by a 12% cost increase. While increases in raw material costs are moderating, they remain at high levels.
Since the second quarter of 2011, we are seeing on average and 11% increase in raw material cost each quarter. We saw the highest increase in the third quarter of 2011. Again, we expect that raw material cost increases will continue to ease over the balance of the year.
In the second quarter, with the easing of raw material cost increases, increased realization of pricing and achievement of other margin improvement initiatives, we believe we have reached an inflection point in our gross margin percentage from both Q1 2012 and the year-ago period.
As a result, our consolidated gross margins improved to 41.8% compared with 39.7% in the second quarter of 2011 reflecting gross margin improvements in both businesses, although both remained below the gross margin pre-inflation levels of 2010. This gross margin improvement resulted in adjusted operating profit margins improving to 18.3%, up from 17% in the prior year quarter or 130 basis point improvement.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expenses, as a percentage of sales increased to 80 basis points to 23.5% of sales, up from 22.7%. The increase in RSA reflects continued R&D spend of close to 8% of sales combined with planned spend in sales activities to support our growth in the emerging markets and higher pension cost. The year-over-year change in RSA is expected to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to increased compensation accruals in the second half of 2012, over the second half of 2011.
Foreign exchange in the second quarter had an approximate 300 basis point impact on the top line, but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our cash flow hedging activities, which we’ve discussed in the past. Looking ahead, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 1.39. However, given the deterioration of the euro with current rates at 1.24, we expect headwinds from foreign exchange to increase despite our hedging activities.
The full-year FX impact on our EPS is approximately $0.05 versus what we outlined on our first quarter call, when the euro was trading more in the range of 1.30. Of course, this will be affected by any change in rates throughout the second half of the year. Note also that we are nearly 50% hedged against the euro for 2013 at levels that approximate 1.30.
From a cash flow perspective, for the first half of the year, our operating cash flow increased by $133 million of the first half of 2011. This was driven by increases in net income, improved core working capital, lower incentive compensation payouts in the first quarter of the year, and lower tax payments.
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance due to our investments in Singapore and China, and we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full-year 2012. Our investments in the Singapore and China are progressing well, and we will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth with a specific concentration on the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms.
Our history has proven the willingness to return cash to shareholders and our Board authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share of the company’s stock, an increase of $0.03 from the current quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. We expect to continue to increase our dividend in line with our earnings growth while investing in attractive growth opportunities.
I would also like to make some comments regarding our recently announced settlement with the Spanish tax authorities. As a result of the settlement, we will report an after tax charge of $72.4 million or $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2012. We have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of €86 million or approximately $106 million before the end of the year.
The settlement was the result of recent discussions and we are satisfied with the outcome. Not only does it remove much uncertainty related to our past tax position, but importantly, we were able to agree upon the key principles that will establish the company’s tax basis in Spain for 2012 and future years. We expect to formalize this agreement before the end of 2012, and believe the terms of our agreement will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate going forward.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year.

Although we are pleased with our performance this quarter, we are mindful of the challenges that lie ahead related to slowing macroeconomic growth in Western Europe, the foreign exchange headwinds coming from the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro, and ongoing top line pressure we anticipate on the ingredients business. Although we’re cautious about the second half of the year, we are positive about many aspects of our business. We’ve seen strong and consistent growth from Flavors in every region and our Fragrance Compounds business enjoyed strong growth in Greater Asia and Latin America.
We have often said that our customers’ products are resilient even in a slowing economy, and we are seeing signs of this. Given the strengths of our customer relationships, based in part on our ability to provide them with valuable insights related to consumer preferences as well as our robust pipeline of innovation from R&D, we expect to continue to grow. From a top line perspective, we expect to see continued local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities in the second half of this year.
In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in Fine & Beauty Care while also maintaining solid growth in functional. In total, we believe that many parts of our business will demonstrate continued growth. The one area where we see risk to our forecast is in Ingredients as current trends remain weak on our external portfolio due to price competition on non-patented ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace. Ingredients, although an important part of our business, accounts for less than 10% of our external sales and we want to put their performance into perspective. 
We expect to see Fragrance Ingredients continue to experience top line pressure in the near term, certainly during the third quarter. Decisions that are made by our customers, based on price or anything else for that matter have long-term implications for the business and we need to adjust our business model as needed to the new insights into the current market dynamics. With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material cost will continue to stabilize at current rates. We expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year ago levels. 
With regard to earnings per share, it is our policy not to give guidance; however, excluding the impact of the Spanish tax settlement, we believe that if our business continues to perform as we expected, we will be able to deliver year-over-year earnings per share growth more in line with the current marketplace estimates. We will continue to make investments in our business, which are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth, which remains our focus. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the lagging and uneven recovery cycle for foreign exchange pressures and softness ingredients.
In conclusion, our strong performance this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity, and our ability to work with our customers year-in and year-out to develop new products that define the industry and delight consumers. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook, given the lagging economic growth in many areas of the globe. We will proactively manage our performance and calibrate our costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.
With that, here at IFF, we would be glad to take any questions you may have.

Good morning to you. Look, I think in terms of the incentive comp, the way I would direct you is to look at our second quarter numbers that is pretty much very close to a normalized level of incentive comp and that would probably be a good measure to talk to or to model out for the balance of the year, that would not be a bad assumption, assuming we could continue to perform at our level of expectations. As you know, deterioration over the back half of last year resulted in us changing our incentive comp. so there will be differences versus year ago. if you use kind of the year-to-date figures, they’re going to be pretty close in terms of what our expectations might be going forward.
As it relates to pricing, I think as you look at our total pricing for the quarter, effectively we had nearly 3% of pricing that was seen in the quarter. However, I will let you know that’s certainly skewed because of the dynamics of the Fragrance and Ingredients business. So if you look at the 3% kind of pricing number or close to it versus the 4%, it looks like the majority of the sales growth is coming from pricing. but if you eliminate the ingredients dynamic and really talk to just the effects relative to our compound business, we actually saw a greater than 50% of our growth in the compound business came from volume with, let’s call it 45% coming from pricing. So that continues to be an effort that we have been working on over the course of 2011, and there will be some subsequent discussions that continue to occur over the balance of 2012 as well, although much of the pricing has already been put in place.

So we still see there is a bright future, we’ve done the economic profit analysis to understand how important this business is, revisiting briefly a comment that Jeff made a while ago, we did not foresee the magnitude of the shift in volumes. 
So we’ve had four quarters of some softness and thought at this stage of the game, we would be coming out of that trough and comparing against an acceptable target in order to achieve growth that hasn’t happened. but that’s really what the focus is right now, but how important it is both internally and continues to be externally, despite the growth, it’s still a large part of the volume, we’ll keep the microscope on it at a very big level.

We are pleased with our performance this quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic challenges presented by the ongoing difficulties in Western Europe and external sales volume declines in our Fragrance Ingredients business. Despite these challenges, we were able to deliver solid top line growth and even stronger double-digit earnings per share growth due to our efforts to diversify our revenue base, focus on our customers and control our costs.
Our diversity in terms of our customers, our end-use categories and our geographic footprint allowed us to continue to grow our business this quarter and deliver local currency sales growth of 4% and, on a like-for-like basis, local currency sales growth of 5%. The growth we achieved this quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2011 is due to the momentum we have established in many areas of the business. Our global reach and our customer intimacy enable us to better serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities that are available today for market share growth.
IFF’s growth this quarter was driven by our Flavors business, which delivered 8% local currency growth on top of 8% local currency growth in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year performance reflects the balanced and the consistent nature of our business, and a strong and growing presence we have in emerging markets. We also saw growth in our Fragrance Compounds business this quarter, which delivered 6% local currency sales growth.
Solid growth in both the Fine & Beauty Care and the Functional Fragrance categories offset continued erosion in Ingredients. Nicolas Mirzayantz will provide more details on our Ingredients business later in the call. As anticipated, this quarter was an inflection point for our business in terms of volume, costs and profitability and we are pleased with the results.
Raw material cost increases started to ease this quarter. However, they remain at high levels. As you know, raw material prices have been increasing for the last 5 quarters, on average, by 11% each quarter. We have been able to mitigate this inflation through pricing, resulting in a more favorable relationship between raw material price increases and pricing this quarter.
Our other margin enhancing efforts, including cost efficiencies and volume leverage when combined with pricing led to gross margins expanding 210 basis points to 41.8% this quarter versus 39.7% in the year-ago and 40.2% in the first quarter of 2012. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $132.3 million driven by gross margin expansion and our cost management discipline. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 18.3% of sales from the second quarter of 2011.
Our enhanced operating profit combined with lower interest expense and other income and expense gains resulted in our ability to achieve earnings per share of $1.08 this quarter. We are able to achieve these results off of modest top line growth due to a continued focus on margin improvement opportunities, which include the exit of low-margin business that Hernan will talk to.
We’ll now turn the call over to Hernan and Nicolas, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin Berryman, our CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sessions, I will give you some perspective on our outlook for the balance of the year.
I would now like to introduce our Group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman."

I am pleased to report that this quarter, the Flavor business delivered 9% local currency growth on a like-for-like basis, which excludes approximately one percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin sales activities, on top of that 8% local currency growth that we delivered in the second quarter of 2011. This is our 26 consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. This quarter, we delivered a strong growth across all regions and categories, with sequential growth over the first quarter in every region. Our beverage category achieved double-digit growth this quarter, while Savory, Sweet, Dairy also delivered solid growth.
In North America, like-for-like growth was 12% excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities. The best-performing category was, once again beverage, which was up strong double-digit due to new exciting wins in a steel beverage and other refreshing drinks. Dairy also delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter. We also saw incremental sales related to our sweetness modulation tools. Savory also increased on a like-for-like basis of winning part to savory modulation tools as part of our health and wellness initiatives.
Within our EAME region, like-for-like growth of 8% was led by strong growth in savory. Western Europe continues to be positive territory overall, due to continued strong wins in the market and volume growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East.
In Latin America, local currency growth was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Sweet and a strong growth in Dairy and Beverage. We are looking to improve our sales momentum in Latin America. Greater Asia is our largest region, and once again, this region delivered a strong growth with 9% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 10%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet.
As you know, our Flavors business is heavily indexed in the emerging markets, which are growing a bit much faster rate than other areas of the world due to changes in disposable income and lifestyle. People in these markets are not only looking for great, authentic taste and convenience. They are looking for healthier options in the food they eat.
To better support our customers in the emerging markets, we are building new facilities in Singapore and China, and expect to be making announcement of the opening of Singapore later this year and China early next year. We continue to invest in building creative centers that expand our global footprint and put us in closer proximity to our customer base.
In June, we announced the opening of a new facility in Delhi, India, to house creative, technical, sensory and sales professionals. This facility will help us to better serve our global and regional customers’ present and future needs and create the best taste for the Indian market. We have an 80 years history in India and this investment, together with our investment in Singapore and China, demonstrate our faith and commitment to the region.
This quarter, Flavors in emerging market achieved double digit increase on a local currency basis for the eleventh consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by double digit-local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, as well as strong growth in South Cone and Brazil.
Turning to profit, second quarter segment operating profit increased $10 million or 13.5% to $81 million. The strong volume, driven in part by new wins, favorable mix, pricing increase, the exiting of low margin business and ongoing cost reductions, more than offset rising raw material costs and resulted in increased gross margins. Improved our gross margins more than offset increases in research, selling and admin expenses.
Operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the previous year to 22.3. This quarter, RSA was negatively affected by a payment to our biotech partner. As we reach a milestone in our collaboration much sooner than expected, we are excited about this collaboration and look forward to telling you more about the project as it evolves. Looking ahead, we expect to see consistent sales growth in the second half of 2012, led by continued momentum in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities, which I expect will be more than twice the levels seen in the first half of this year.
However, our consistent underlying sales growth remains strong, driven by new businesses wins, using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers’ end products healthier. We are excited of our future growth prospect.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances."

For Fragrances in the second quarter of 2012, local currency sales were flat compared with the prior year quarter. Improved pricing, new business wins and favorable product mix were offset by declining ingred",787,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, everyone. For Fragrances in the second quarter of 2012, local currency sales were flat compared with the prior year quarter. Improved pricing, new business wins and favorable product mix were offset by declining ingredients volume. We saw positive trends in many areas of the business, resulting in a sequential improvement over the prior quarter in our Fragrance Compound business.
Local currency sales gross in Fine & Beauty Care increased 4% with strong growth in hair care in all regions and in toiletries, especially in Latin America and EAME. The Fine & Beauty category was up 29% in LatAm and 11% in Greater Asia. In Functional Fragrance, we saw strong growth led by fabric care. Local currency sales growth of 7% was positive for the sixteenth consecutive quarter as new business wins, less erosion in the base business and the realization of price increases continue to drive results.
The Functional Fragrance category was up 11% in Latin America, up 6% in Greater Asia and up 8% in EAME. Our Fragrance Compound business was up 6% overall, led by strong growth in Latin America and Greater Asia. This growth reflects the strength of our strategic relationships with our global and regional customers and our long-standing presence in the emerging markets.
Sales from encapsulation technology continued to increase double-digit and supported the growth in our Functional Fragrance business. Unfortunately, we’re facing continued challenges in both Western Europe and in Fragrance Ingredients.
Our total Fragrance business in EAME had negative local currency growth due to a 4% decline in Fine & Beauty Care and 24% decline in ingredients offset in part by the growth of 8% in Functional Fragrances. Sales in our EAME region were negatively affected by the ongoing Eurozone issues and the effect of economic uncertainty and unemployment on disposable income.
Now, I’d like to say a few words on Fragrance Ingredients since this has been a concern to investors. Over the past year, we have seen continued deterioration on the external sales components of our Fragrance Ingredients business. This has prompted a thorough strategic review of our Ingredients business.
Unprecedented increases in input cost and the resulting change in both competitive pricing and our customers’ willingness to take additional supply chain risk to minimize their own input cost pressures have resulted in a change in industry dynamics. With the availability of cheaper materials from low price manufacturers in China and India, we are seeing incremental pressure on the top line, particularly in those non-patent protected ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace.
Our strategic review and evaluation of options to improve the overall performance of our Ingredient business has confirmed that the Ingredient business has been and continues to be of strategic value to IFF, due to the supply of cost advantage ingredients to our Fragrance Compounds business and the profitable sales of ingredients to external customers at acceptable margins. Overall, we have maintained our gross margin in this business, even on the lower volume.
I want to make clear that we are not looking to close or sell this business based on our current views. However, changes to operating models are required. We are now developing the specifics for how we will execute against the plan that will reduce cost to levels consistent with existing realities of the market. We will be communicating further actions to you at the appropriate time, so as not to impact our competitive positioning and ability to successfully execute.
After 4 challenging quarters, our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and discipline, improved mix and pricing allowed us to more than offset continued, although lower, increases in raw material input costs. As a result of these factors, gross margins expanded over the prior year, helping support gross margin expansion at the consolidated level and resulted in improved segment operating profit.
Segment operating profit increased 2% or $1 million this quarter to $64 million. Our segment operating margin expended 90 basis points to 17.7%, up from 16.8% a year ago. We expect category and geographic diversification to help mitigate continued volume declines in Fragrance Ingredients. We expect to see continued momentum in Fine & Beauty Care and moderate growth in Functional Fragrance.
We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as continued traction against our encapsulation technology. But we still must be mindful of potential economic weakness in Europe where economies are under pressure and in ingredients. We also expect continued margin recovery as we continue to implement further increases in pricing and focus on cost efficiencies and cost discipline.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO."
281407,214080532,344142,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2012",2012-08-08,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4",1477,"Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4%. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of lower margin discontinued sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 5%, reflecting improved sales trends in many parts of our global business.
As you’ve heard from Hernan, Flavors achieved high single-digit growth in every region, an 8% growth overall. This is on top of 8% growth in the year-ago quarter, which speaks to the consistency and stability of this business. Excluding the impact of discontinued business, Flavors growth was 9% led by a long list of new product wins among a diverse set of customers.
In Fragrance, the growth in Fine & Beauty Care and Functional was much improved from the first quarter, although the 6% local currency growth in compounds was offset by volume softness in Ingredients, resulting in flat Fragrance local currency sales growth for the quarter.
I want to saw a few words about our performance in Europe. We have seen some weakness in Western Europe, particularly in those countries whose economies are challenged by low growth and high unemployment. Overall, our Flavors business continues to grow, but our Fragrance business, which accounts for nearly 2/3 of the volume in Western Europe, has been pressured by both the weakness in European economies as well as pressure in Ingredients.
On the positive side, we are not heavily indexed to the countries that are most under economic pressure and even though our volume is somewhat impacted, our geographic diversity has muted the impact. As you know, we have a large geographic footprint in both developed and emerging markets.
We are extremely well indexed in the emerging markets, perhaps better than any of our competitors, but we are seeing emerging market growth of 9% this quarter on a local currency basis led by very high growth in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and Vietnam. The emerging markets represented 48% of our sales in the second quarter, up from 46% of sales in the first quarter, so they continue to grow much faster than the developed markets.
Many of you have been asking about our ingredients progress and I wanted to add a few words to what Nicolas has shared with you about the strategic review. As he said, we are developing a detailed plan for making changes to our business model. I’d like to provide some insight into how that will play out over the near term.
Due to the complexities of the business, we do not expect to see any material changes to our business in the near term, especially in the third quarter. However, we do believe our plan will result in a stronger and more sustainable foundation longer term.
Turning to bottom line growth, adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $132.3 million this quarter due to pricing actions and volume gains, which more than offset increases in raw material costs and increased incentive compensation accruals.
Interest expense declined to $1.4 million in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt and other income. Expenses improved to $1.9 million year-over-year due to favorable exchange gain and losses on outstanding working capital balances.
I’d also like to talk briefly about our second quarter tax rate. This year, our effective tax rate was 27.7% versus 27.4% a year-ago. This is primarily due to a reserve adjustment related to one of our tax defaulting cases in Spain. Other provision adjustments on uncertain tax positions and the absence of an R&D tax credit in U.S. during the second quarter of 2012. Despite the slightly higher tax rate of 27.7%, adjusted EPS was still able to increase 11% to $1.08, up from $0.97 in the second quarter of 2011, when excluding restructuring and other charges of $0.04 per share in the prior year quarter.
As expected, and as we discussed on our first quarter conference call, our raw material cost increases started to moderate in the second quarter. As you can see in this slide, material costs were up 5% this quarter, and they are growing at a slower rate than in the second quarter of 2011 when they were impacted by a 12% cost increase. While increases in raw material costs are moderating, they remain at high levels.
Since the second quarter of 2011, we are seeing on average an 11% increase in raw material cost each quarter. We saw the highest increase in the third quarter of 2011. Again, we expect that raw material cost increases will continue to ease over the balance of the year.
In the second quarter, with the easing of raw material cost increases, increased realization of pricing and achievement of other margin improvement initiatives, we believe we have reached an inflection point in our gross margin percentage from both Q1 2012 and the year-ago period.
As a result, our consolidated gross margins improved to 41.8% compared with 39.7% in the second quarter of 2011, reflecting gross margin improvements in both businesses, although both remained below the gross margin pre-inflation levels of 2010. This gross margin improvement resulted in adjusted operating profit margins improving to 18.3%, up from 17% in the prior year quarter, or 130 basis point improvement.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expenses, as a percentage of sales increased to 80 basis points to 23.5% of sales, up from 22.7%. The increase in RSA reflects continued R&D spend of close to 8% of sales combined with planned spend in sales activities to support our growth in the emerging markets and higher pension costs. The year-over-year change in RSA is expected to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to increased compensation accruals in the second half of 2012, over the second half of 2011.
Foreign exchange in the second quarter had an approximate 300 basis point impact on the top line, but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our cash flow hedging activities, which we’ve discussed in the past. Looking ahead, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 1.39. However, given the deterioration of the euro with current rates at 1.24, we expect headwinds from foreign exchange to increase despite our hedging activities.
The full-year FX impact on our EPS is approximately $0.05 versus what we outlined on our first quarter call, when the euro was trading more in the range of 1.30. Of course, this will be affected by any change in rates throughout the second half of the year. Note also that we are nearly 50% hedged against the euro for 2013 at levels that approximate 1.30.
From a cash flow perspective, for the first half of the year, our operating cash flow increased by $133 million at the first half of 2011. This was driven by increases in net income, improved core working capital, lower incentive compensation payouts in the first quarter of the year and lower tax payments.
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance due to our investments in Singapore and China, and we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full-year 2012. Our investments in the Singapore and China are progressing well, and we will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth with a specific concentration on the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms.
Our history has proven the willingness to return cash to shareholders and our Board authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share of the company’s stock, an increase of $0.03 from the current quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. We expect to continue to increase our dividend in line with our earnings growth, while investing in attractive growth opportunities.
I would also like to make some comments regarding our recently announced settlement with the Spanish tax authorities. As a result of the settlement, we will report an after tax charge of $72.4 million or $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2012. We have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of €86 million or approximately $106 million before the end of the year.
The settlement was the result of recent discussions and we are satisfied with the outcome. Not only does it remove much uncertainty related to our past tax position, but importantly, we were able to agree upon the key principles that will establish the company’s tax basis in Spain for 2012 and future years. We expect to formalize this agreement before the end of 2012, and believe the terms of our agreement will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate going forward.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

Although we are pleased with our performance this quarter, we are mindful of the challenges that lie ahead related to slowing macroeconomic growth in Western Europe, the foreign exchange headwinds coming from the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro, and ongoing top line pressure we anticipate on the ingredients business. Although we’re cautious about the second half of the year, we are positive about many aspects of our business. We’ve seen strong and consistent growth from Flavors in every region and our Fragrance Compounds business enjoyed strong growth in Greater Asia and Latin America.
We have often said that our customers’ products are resilient even in a slowing economy, and we are seeing signs of this. Given the strengths of our customer relationships, based in part on our ability to provide them with valuable insights related to consumer preferences as well as our robust pipeline of innovation from R&D, we expect to continue to grow. From a top line perspective, we expect to see continued local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities in the second half of this year.
In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in Fine & Beauty Care while also maintaining solid growth in functional. In total, we believe that many parts of our business will demonstrate continued growth. The one area where we see risk to our forecast is in Ingredients, as current trends remain weak on our external portfolio due to price competition on non-patented ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace. Ingredients, although an important part of our business, accounts for less than 10% of our external sales and we want to put their performance into perspective.
We expect to see Fragrance Ingredients continue to experience top line pressure in the near term, certainly during the third quarter. Decisions that are made by our customers, based on price or anything else for that matter, have long-term implications for the business and we need to adjust our business model as needed to the new insights into the current market dynamics. With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material cost will continue to stabilize at current rates. We expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year ago levels.
With regard to earnings per share, it is our policy not to give guidance; however, excluding the impact of the Spanish tax settlement, we believe that if our business continues to perform as we expected, we will be able to deliver year-over-year earnings per share growth more in line with the current marketplace estimates. We will continue to make investments in our business, which are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth, which remains our focus. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the lagging and uneven recovery cycle for foreign exchange pressures and softness ingredients.
In conclusion, our strong performance this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity, and our ability to work with our customers year-in and year-out to develop new products that define the industry and delight consumers. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook, given the lagging economic growth in many areas of the globe. We will proactively manage our performance and calibrate our costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.
With that, here at IFF, we would be glad to take any questions you may have."

This is Kevin. Good morning to you. Look, I think in terms of the incentive comp, the way I would direct you is to look at our second quarter numbers, that is pretty much very close to a normalized level of incentive comp and that would probably be a good measure to talk to or to model out for the balance of the year, that would not be a bad assumption, assuming we could continue to perform at our level of expectations. As you know, deterioration over the back half of last year resulted in us changing our incentive comp. So there will be differences versus year ago. If you use kind of the year-to-date figures, they’re going to be pretty close in terms of what our expectations might be going forward.
As it relates to pricing, I think as you look at our total pricing for the quarter, effectively we had nearly 3% of pricing that was seen in the quarter. However, I will let you know that’s certainly skewed because of the dynamics of the Fragrance and Ingredients business. So if you look at the 3% kind of pricing number or close to it versus the 4%, it looks like the majority of the sales growth is coming from pricing. But if you eliminate the ingredients dynamic and really talk to just the effects relative to our compound business, we actually saw a greater than 50% of our growth in the compound business came from volume with, let’s call it 45% coming from pricing. So that continues to be an effort that we have been working on over the course of 2011, and there will be some subsequent discussions that continue to occur over the balance of 2012 as well, although much of the pricing has already been put in place."

So, I think you’re kind of running maybe upper single-digits for the first half, and I think from last quarter, you had mentioned an expectation for the year to be kind of have a modest inflation.

So, I think that it’s probably too early to say, at the end of the day, exactly what happened on input cost by the end of the year, because it will depend upon the mix and the use and so on and so forth. But certainly, it’s trending in the right direction.
And then I would echo the comments of my business units, our colleagues who have talked that the input costs continue to remain at elevated levels and certainly, well above the levels of 2010 before the inflation that we saw significantly in over the course of the last 12 months or thereabout. So, certainly, we’re expecting to see that continue to improve. As it relates to 2013, a little bit early to say at this particular point in time and we’ll provide some additional guidance when the time is appropriate, but certainly the comments that we would make is, we’re continuing to see stability versus anything other than that.

Mark, look, it’s the difference in the balance of the year in terms of how the euro has changed in value relative to what we were talking 3 months ago. The reason is, because as you think about our structure of our cash flow hedges, those hedges are supporting investments or purchases of materials. Those materials go into inventory at the hedged levels and consequently, as we get closer to the end of the year, the benefits of those hedges start to rollover into the 2013 year as opposed to seeing the benefits this year.
So effectively, if the euro continues to deteriorate in this year specifically, we’ll see incremental pressure because the hedges that are impacting our current purchases will more likely than not impact next year as opposed to this year."

So we still see there is a bright future, we’ve done the economic profit analysis to understand how important this business is, revisiting briefly a comment that Jeff made a while ago, we did not foresee the magnitude of the shift in volumes.
So we’ve had 4 quarters of some softness and thought at this stage of the game, we would be coming out of that trough and comparing against an acceptable target in order to achieve growth, that hasn’t happened. but that’s really what the focus is right now, but how important it is both internally and continues to be externally, despite the growth, it’s still a large part of the volume, we’ll keep the microscope on it at a very big level."

We are pleased with our performance this quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic challenges presented by the ongoing difficulties in Western Europe and external sales volume declines in our Fragrance Ingredients business. Despite these challenges, we were able to deliver solid top line growth and even stronger double-digit earnings per share growth due to our efforts to diversify our revenue base, focus on our customers and control our costs.
Our diversity in terms of our customers, our end-use categories and our geographic footprint allowed us to continue to grow our business this quarter and deliver local currency sales growth of 4% and, on a like-for-like basis, local currency sales growth of 5%. The growth we achieved this quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2011 is due to the momentum we have established in many areas of the business. Our global reach and our customer intimacy enable us to better serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities that are available today for market share growth.
IFF’s growth this quarter was driven by our Flavors business, which delivered 8% local currency growth on top of 8% local currency growth in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year performance reflects the balanced and the consistent nature of our business, and a strong and growing presence we have in emerging markets. We also saw growth in our Fragrance Compounds business this quarter, which delivered 6% local currency sales growth.
Solid growth in both the Fine & Beauty Care and the Functional Fragrance categories offset continued erosion in Ingredients. Nicolas Mirzayantz will provide more details on our Ingredients business later in the call. As anticipated, this quarter was an inflection point for our business in terms of volume, costs and profitability and we are pleased with the results.
Raw material cost increases started to ease this quarter. However, they remain at high levels. As you know, raw material prices have been increasing for the last 5 quarters, on average, by 11% each quarter. We have been able to mitigate this inflation through pricing, resulting in a more favorable relationship between raw material price increases and pricing this quarter.
Our other margin enhancing efforts, including cost efficiencies and volume leverage when combined with pricing led to gross margins expanding 210 basis points to 41.8% this quarter versus 39.7% in the year-ago and 40.2% in the first quarter of 2012. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $132.3 million driven by gross margin expansion and our cost management discipline. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 18.3% of sales from the second quarter of 2011.
Our enhanced operating profit combined with lower interest expense and other income and expense gains resulted in our ability to achieve earnings per share of $1.08 this quarter. We are able to achieve these results off of modest top line growth due to a continued focus on margin improvement opportunities, which include the exit of low-margin business that Hernan will talk to.
We’ll now turn the call over to Hernan and Nicolas, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin Berryman, our CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sessions, I will give you some perspective on our outlook for the balance of the year.
I would now like to introduce our Group President of Flavors, Hernan Vaisman."

I am pleased to report that this quarter, the Flavor business delivered 9% local currency growth on a like-for-like basis, which excludes approximately one percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin sales activities",776,"Thank you, Doug. I am pleased to report that this quarter, the Flavor business delivered 9% local currency growth on a like-for-like basis, which excludes approximately one percentage point associated with the strategic exit of low-margin sales activities, on top of that 8% local currency growth that we delivered in the second quarter of 2011. This is our 26 consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. This quarter, we delivered a strong growth across all regions and categories, with sequential growth over the first quarter in every region. Our beverage category achieved double-digit growth this quarter, while Savory, Sweet, Dairy also delivered solid growth.
In North America, like-for-like growth was 12% excluding the exit of low-margin sales activities. The best-performing category was, once again beverage, which was up strong double-digit due to new exciting wins in a steel beverage and other refreshing drinks. Dairy also delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter. We also saw incremental sales related to our sweetness modulation tools. Savory also increased on a like-for-like basis of winning part to savory modulation tools as part of our health and wellness initiatives.
Within our EAME region, like-for-like growth of 8% was led by strong growth in savory. Western Europe continues to be positive territory overall, due to continued strong wins in the market and volume growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East.
In Latin America, local currency growth was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Sweet and a strong growth in Dairy and Beverage. We are looking to improve our sales momentum in Latin America. Greater Asia is our largest region, and once again, this region delivered a strong growth with 9% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 10%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet.
As you know, our Flavors business is heavily indexed in the emerging markets, which are growing a bit much faster rate than other areas of the world due to changes in disposable income and lifestyle. People in these markets are not only looking for great, authentic taste and convenience. They are looking for healthier options in the food they eat.
To better support our customers in the emerging markets, we are building new facilities in Singapore and China, and expect to be making announcement of the opening of Singapore later this year and China early next year. We continue to invest in building creative centers that expand our global footprint and put us in closer proximity to our customer base.
In June, we announced the opening of a new facility in Delhi, India, to house creative, technical, sensory and sales professionals. This facility will help us to better serve our global and regional customers’ present and future needs and create the best taste for the Indian market. We have an 80 years history in India and this investment, together with our investment in Singapore and China, demonstrate our faith and commitment to the region.
This quarter, Flavors in emerging market achieved double digit increase on a local currency basis for the eleventh consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by double digit-local currency growth in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, as well as strong growth in South Cone and Brazil.
Turning to profit, second quarter segment operating profit increased $10 million or 13.5% to $81 million. The strong volume, driven in part by new wins, favorable mix, pricing increase, the exiting of low margin business and ongoing cost reductions, more than offset rising raw material costs and resulted in increased gross margins. Improved our gross margins more than offset increases in research, selling and admin expenses.
Operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus the previous year to 22.3. This quarter, RSA was negatively affected by a payment to our biotech partner. As we reach a milestone in our collaboration much sooner than expected, we are excited about this collaboration and look forward to telling you more about the project as it evolves. Looking ahead, we expect to see consistent sales growth in the second half of 2012, led by continued momentum in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities, which I expect will be more than twice the levels seen in the first half of this year.
However, our consistent underlying sales growth remains strong, driven by new businesses wins, using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers’ end products healthier. We are excited of our future growth prospect.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, our Group President of Fragrances."
281407,214080532,344396,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2012",2012-08-08,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, everyone. For Fragrances in the second quarter of 2012, local currency sales were flat compared with the prior year quarter. Improved pricing, new business wins and favorable product mix were offset by declining ingred",787,"Thank you, Hernan, and good morning, everyone. For Fragrances in the second quarter of 2012, local currency sales were flat compared with the prior year quarter. Improved pricing, new business wins and favorable product mix were offset by declining ingredients volume. We saw positive trends in many areas of the business, resulting in a sequential improvement over the prior quarter in our Fragrance Compound business.
Local currency sales gross in Fine & Beauty Care increased 4% with strong growth in hair care in all regions and in toiletries, especially in Latin America and EAME. The Fine & Beauty category was up 29% in LatAm and 11% in Greater Asia. In Functional Fragrance, we saw strong growth led by fabric care. Local currency sales growth of 7% was positive for the sixteenth consecutive quarter as new business wins, less erosion in the base business and the realization of price increases continue to drive results.
The Functional Fragrance category was up 11% in Latin America, up 6% in Greater Asia and up 8% in EAME. Our Fragrance Compound business was up 6% overall, led by strong growth in Latin America and Greater Asia. This growth reflects the strength of our strategic relationships with our global and regional customers and our long-standing presence in the emerging markets.
Sales from encapsulation technology continued to increase double-digit and supported the growth in our Functional Fragrance business. Unfortunately, we’re facing continued challenges in both Western Europe and in Fragrance Ingredients.
Our total Fragrance business in EAME had negative local currency growth due to a 4% decline in Fine & Beauty Care and 24% decline in ingredients offset in part by the growth of 8% in Functional Fragrances. Sales in our EAME region were negatively affected by the ongoing Eurozone issues and the effect of economic uncertainty and unemployment on disposable income.
Now, I’d like to say a few words on Fragrance Ingredients since this has been a concern to investors. Over the past year, we have seen continued deterioration on the external sales components of our Fragrance Ingredients business. This has prompted a thorough strategic review of our Ingredients business.
Unprecedented increases in input cost and the resulting change in both competitive pricing and our customers’ willingness to take additional supply chain risk to minimize their own input cost pressures have resulted in a change in industry dynamics. With the availability of cheaper materials from low price manufacturers in China and India, we are seeing incremental pressure on the top line, particularly in those non-patent protected ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace.
Our strategic review and evaluation of options to improve the overall performance of our Ingredient business has confirmed that the Ingredient business has been and continues to be of strategic value to IFF, due to the supply of cost advantage ingredients to our Fragrance Compounds business and the profitable sales of ingredients to external customers at acceptable margins. Overall, we have maintained our gross margin in this business, even on the lower volume.
I want to make clear that we are not looking to close or sell this business based on our current views. However, changes to operating models are required. We are now developing the specifics for how we will execute against the plan that will reduce cost to levels consistent with existing realities of the market. We will be communicating further actions to you at the appropriate time, so as not to impact our competitive positioning and ability to successfully execute.
After 4 challenging quarters, our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and discipline, improved mix and pricing allowed us to more than offset continued, although lower, increases in raw material input costs. As a result of these factors, gross margins expanded over the prior year, helping support gross margin expansion at the consolidated level and resulted in improved segment operating profit.
Segment operating profit increased 2% or $1 million this quarter to $64 million. Our segment operating margin expended 90 basis points to 17.7%, up from 16.8% a year ago. We expect category and geographic diversification to help mitigate continued volume declines in Fragrance Ingredients. We expect to see continued momentum in Fine & Beauty Care and moderate growth in Functional Fragrance.
We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as continued traction against our encapsulation technology. But we still must be mindful of potential economic weakness in Europe where economies are under pressure and in ingredients. We also expect continued margin recovery as we continue to implement further increases in pricing and focus on cost efficiencies and cost discipline.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO."
281407,214080532,344396,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2012",2012-08-08,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4",1477,"Thank you, Nicolas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reported revenues for the second quarter totaled $721.3 million, an increase of 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, local currency sales increased 4%. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of lower margin discontinued sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 5%, reflecting improved sales trends in many parts of our global business.
As you’ve heard from Hernan, Flavors achieved high single-digit growth in every region, an 8% growth overall. This is on top of 8% growth in the year-ago quarter, which speaks to the consistency and stability of this business. Excluding the impact of discontinued business, Flavors growth was 9% led by a long list of new product wins among a diverse set of customers.
In Fragrance, the growth in Fine & Beauty Care and Functional was much improved from the first quarter, although the 6% local currency growth in compounds was offset by volume softness in Ingredients, resulting in flat Fragrance local currency sales growth for the quarter.
I want to saw a few words about our performance in Europe. We have seen some weakness in Western Europe, particularly in those countries whose economies are challenged by low growth and high unemployment. Overall, our Flavors business continues to grow, but our Fragrance business, which accounts for nearly 2/3 of the volume in Western Europe, has been pressured by both the weakness in European economies as well as pressure in Ingredients.
On the positive side, we are not heavily indexed to the countries that are most under economic pressure and even though our volume is somewhat impacted, our geographic diversity has muted the impact. As you know, we have a large geographic footprint in both developed and emerging markets.
We are extremely well indexed in the emerging markets, perhaps better than any of our competitors, but we are seeing emerging market growth of 9% this quarter on a local currency basis led by very high growth in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and Vietnam. The emerging markets represented 48% of our sales in the second quarter, up from 46% of sales in the first quarter, so they continue to grow much faster than the developed markets.
Many of you have been asking about our ingredients progress and I wanted to add a few words to what Nicolas has shared with you about the strategic review. As he said, we are developing a detailed plan for making changes to our business model. I’d like to provide some insight into how that will play out over the near term.
Due to the complexities of the business, we do not expect to see any material changes to our business in the near term, especially in the third quarter. However, we do believe our plan will result in a stronger and more sustainable foundation longer term.
Turning to bottom line growth, adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $132.3 million this quarter due to pricing actions and volume gains, which more than offset increases in raw material costs and increased incentive compensation accruals.
Interest expense declined to $1.4 million in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt and other income. Expenses improved to $1.9 million year-over-year due to favorable exchange gain and losses on outstanding working capital balances.
I’d also like to talk briefly about our second quarter tax rate. This year, our effective tax rate was 27.7% versus 27.4% a year-ago. This is primarily due to a reserve adjustment related to one of our tax defaulting cases in Spain. Other provision adjustments on uncertain tax positions and the absence of an R&D tax credit in U.S. during the second quarter of 2012. Despite the slightly higher tax rate of 27.7%, adjusted EPS was still able to increase 11% to $1.08, up from $0.97 in the second quarter of 2011, when excluding restructuring and other charges of $0.04 per share in the prior year quarter.
As expected, and as we discussed on our first quarter conference call, our raw material cost increases started to moderate in the second quarter. As you can see in this slide, material costs were up 5% this quarter, and they are growing at a slower rate than in the second quarter of 2011 when they were impacted by a 12% cost increase. While increases in raw material costs are moderating, they remain at high levels.
Since the second quarter of 2011, we are seeing on average an 11% increase in raw material cost each quarter. We saw the highest increase in the third quarter of 2011. Again, we expect that raw material cost increases will continue to ease over the balance of the year.
In the second quarter, with the easing of raw material cost increases, increased realization of pricing and achievement of other margin improvement initiatives, we believe we have reached an inflection point in our gross margin percentage from both Q1 2012 and the year-ago period.
As a result, our consolidated gross margins improved to 41.8% compared with 39.7% in the second quarter of 2011, reflecting gross margin improvements in both businesses, although both remained below the gross margin pre-inflation levels of 2010. This gross margin improvement resulted in adjusted operating profit margins improving to 18.3%, up from 17% in the prior year quarter, or 130 basis point improvement.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expenses, as a percentage of sales increased to 80 basis points to 23.5% of sales, up from 22.7%. The increase in RSA reflects continued R&D spend of close to 8% of sales combined with planned spend in sales activities to support our growth in the emerging markets and higher pension costs. The year-over-year change in RSA is expected to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to increased compensation accruals in the second half of 2012, over the second half of 2011.
Foreign exchange in the second quarter had an approximate 300 basis point impact on the top line, but had a lesser impact on profitability as a result of our cash flow hedging activities, which we’ve discussed in the past. Looking ahead, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at a rate near 1.39. However, given the deterioration of the euro with current rates at 1.24, we expect headwinds from foreign exchange to increase despite our hedging activities.
The full-year FX impact on our EPS is approximately $0.05 versus what we outlined on our first quarter call, when the euro was trading more in the range of 1.30. Of course, this will be affected by any change in rates throughout the second half of the year. Note also that we are nearly 50% hedged against the euro for 2013 at levels that approximate 1.30.
From a cash flow perspective, for the first half of the year, our operating cash flow increased by $133 million at the first half of 2011. This was driven by increases in net income, improved core working capital, lower incentive compensation payouts in the first quarter of the year and lower tax payments.
As anticipated, capital expenditures increased in line with our guidance due to our investments in Singapore and China, and we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full-year 2012. Our investments in the Singapore and China are progressing well, and we will continue to be focused on supporting our strategic growth with a specific concentration on the emerging markets and the addition of new technology platforms.
Our history has proven the willingness to return cash to shareholders and our Board authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share of the company’s stock, an increase of $0.03 from the current quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. We expect to continue to increase our dividend in line with our earnings growth, while investing in attractive growth opportunities.
I would also like to make some comments regarding our recently announced settlement with the Spanish tax authorities. As a result of the settlement, we will report an after tax charge of $72.4 million or $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2012. We have agreed to pay an aggregate amount of €86 million or approximately $106 million before the end of the year.
The settlement was the result of recent discussions and we are satisfied with the outcome. Not only does it remove much uncertainty related to our past tax position, but importantly, we were able to agree upon the key principles that will establish the company’s tax basis in Spain for 2012 and future years. We expect to formalize this agreement before the end of 2012, and believe the terms of our agreement will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate going forward.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

Although we are pleased with our performance this quarter, we are mindful of the challenges that lie ahead related to slowing macroeconomic growth in Western Europe, the foreign exchange headwinds coming from the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro, and ongoing top line pressure we anticipate on the ingredients business. Although we’re cautious about the second half of the year, we are positive about many aspects of our business. We’ve seen strong and consistent growth from Flavors in every region and our Fragrance Compounds business enjoyed strong growth in Greater Asia and Latin America.
We have often said that our customers’ products are resilient even in a slowing economy, and we are seeing signs of this. Given the strengths of our customer relationships, based in part on our ability to provide them with valuable insights related to consumer preferences as well as our robust pipeline of innovation from R&D, we expect to continue to grow. From a top line perspective, we expect to see continued local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low margin sales activities in the second half of this year.
In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in Fine & Beauty Care while also maintaining solid growth in functional. In total, we believe that many parts of our business will demonstrate continued growth. The one area where we see risk to our forecast is in Ingredients, as current trends remain weak on our external portfolio due to price competition on non-patented ingredients that are commonly found in the marketplace. Ingredients, although an important part of our business, accounts for less than 10% of our external sales and we want to put their performance into perspective.
We expect to see Fragrance Ingredients continue to experience top line pressure in the near term, certainly during the third quarter. Decisions that are made by our customers, based on price or anything else for that matter, have long-term implications for the business and we need to adjust our business model as needed to the new insights into the current market dynamics. With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material cost will continue to stabilize at current rates. We expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year ago levels.
With regard to earnings per share, it is our policy not to give guidance; however, excluding the impact of the Spanish tax settlement, we believe that if our business continues to perform as we expected, we will be able to deliver year-over-year earnings per share growth more in line with the current marketplace estimates. We will continue to make investments in our business, which are vital to sustain long-term profitable growth, which remains our focus. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook given the lagging and uneven recovery cycle for foreign exchange pressures and softness ingredients.
In conclusion, our strong performance this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity, and our ability to work with our customers year-in and year-out to develop new products that define the industry and delight consumers. Going forward, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook, given the lagging economic growth in many areas of the globe. We will proactively manage our performance and calibrate our costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.
With that, here at IFF, we would be glad to take any questions you may have."

This is Kevin. Good morning to you. Look, I think in terms of the incentive comp, the way I would direct you is to look at our second quarter numbers, that is pretty much very close to a normalized level of incentive comp and that would probably be a good measure to talk to or to model out for the balance of the year, that would not be a bad assumption, assuming we could continue to perform at our level of expectations. As you know, deterioration over the back half of last year resulted in us changing our incentive comp. So there will be differences versus year ago. If you use kind of the year-to-date figures, they’re going to be pretty close in terms of what our expectations might be going forward.
As it relates to pricing, I think as you look at our total pricing for the quarter, effectively we had nearly 3% of pricing that was seen in the quarter. However, I will let you know that’s certainly skewed because of the dynamics of the Fragrance and Ingredients business. So if you look at the 3% kind of pricing number or close to it versus the 4%, it looks like the majority of the sales growth is coming from pricing. But if you eliminate the ingredients dynamic and really talk to just the effects relative to our compound business, we actually saw a greater than 50% of our growth in the compound business came from volume with, let’s call it 45% coming from pricing. So that continues to be an effort that we have been working on over the course of 2011, and there will be some subsequent discussions that continue to occur over the balance of 2012 as well, although much of the pricing has already been put in place."

But certainly, it’s trending in the right direction.
And then I would echo the comments of my business units, our colleagues who have talked that the input costs continue to remain at elevated levels and certainly, well above the levels of 2010 before the inflation that we saw significantly in over the course of the last 12 months or thereabout. So, certainly, we’re expecting to see that continue to improve. As it relates to 2013, a little bit early to say at this particular point in time and we’ll provide some additional guidance when the time is appropriate, but certainly the comments that we would make is, we’re continuing to see stability versus anything other than that.

The reason is, because as you think about our structure of our cash flow hedges, those hedges are supporting investments or purchases of materials. Those materials go into inventory at the hedged levels and consequently, as we get closer to the end of the year, the benefits of those hedges start to rollover into the 2013 year as opposed to seeing the benefits this year.
So effectively, if the euro continues to deteriorate in this year specifically, we’ll see incremental pressure because the hedges that are impacting our current purchases will more likely than not impact next year as opposed to this year."

Our focus on the call this morning is a review our third quarter results and a short discussion on our outlook for the remainder of the year.
As a company with significant operations in New York and in New Jersey, we are very well aware of the impact that Hurricane Sandy has had on people in the area. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to everyone who was affected by the storm, including our own numerous employees in the region.
The solid growth we achieved this third quarter is due to the strategic priorities we have implemented over the past few years to deliver profitable growth by improving the profitability of our product portfolio, strengthening our innovation platform and leveraging our geographic reach. You have heard us say many times that the diversity of our business model, in terms of geographies and use categories and customers, helps to provide us with stable results in good times and bad.
This quarter, we are seeing the cumulative effect of our strategy, combined with the diversity of our business model, resulting in solid momentum and strong growth in both Flavors and Fragrances, even with ongoing economic uncertainty in many parts of the world.
We are very pleased with our progress and encouraged by our results and believe we are on the right path. Both our Flavors & Fragrances compounds businesses delivered strong top line growth and margin recovery this quarter, and we saw strong contributions to overall profitability from both our businesses.
For the total company, we delivered top line, local currency sales growth of 5%, which is the highest quarterly sales growth we have seen since the first quarter of 2011.
On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of the exit of low-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was in fact higher at 7%.
This quarter, we continue to execute on our plan to exit lower margin sales activities in Flavors. We also saw a better mix of business both in the developed and in the emerging markets. 
As expected, we are seeing lower increases in raw material costs, although remain at elevated levels, and we continue to take pricing.  These factors, in addition to ongoing manufacturing efficiencies and other elements such as product mix and new business wins, resulted in gross margin expansion of 350 basis points this quarter to 42.5%, up from 39% in the prior-year quarter.
Our adjusted operating profit increased $6 million or 5% to 164 -- $134 million in the third quarter compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Also our adjusted operating profit margins expanded 100 basis points this quarter to 18.9% compared with 17.9% in the year ago quarter.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.20 per share. The GAAP number includes an $0.88 charge arising from our settlement with the Spanish tax authorities earlier in the quarter. Excluding this charge as well as the $0.01 per share reversal of a restructuring charge in the prior-year quarter, our adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08.
This quarter marks the second consecutive quarter in which we were able to deliver solid EPS growth on an adjusted basis despite the challenging economic environment.
We are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the favorable trends we are seeing in both our top line and bottom line growth. 
I will now turn the call over to Nicolas Mirzayantz, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units and then to Kevin, our CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sections, I will give you some perspective on the outlook for the balance of the year. With that, I'd like to introduce Group President for Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

We achieved solid results in many areas of the business, and overall trends are improving. Our ability to execute on our plan is illustrated by both our top line growth, as well as our recovering profitability.
In terms of our sales performance, we saw accelerating growth in many areas of the business. Local currency sales growth for the Fragrance business was 5% in the third quarter. Fragrance Compounds grew by 9% in local currency, fueled by 10% growth in Fine & Beauty Care and 8% growth in Functional Fragrance. We attribute our success to the strength of our strategic relationships with our customers, our knowledge and insight into consumer preferences and our ability to provide superior product that meet customer needs.
I want to focus on some of the positive trends we are seeing, and there are many. Over the past 3 quarters, Fragrance Compound local currency sales growth has accelerated in every quarter. We grew from the 1% decline in the first quarter to a 6% increase in the second quarter to a 9% increase in the third quarter.
This growth in Fragrance Compounds was led by 17% growth in Latin America, 8% growth in North America and 7% growth in EAME. We are very encouraged by the results that we are seeing.
In terms of drivers, Fragrances sales growth this quarter was driven by a strong pipeline of new wins, continued pricing and lower volume declines on existing business.
On the category basis, Fine & Beauty Care achieved 10% local currency sales growth, led by strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Toiletries. This quarter, new launch of Fine Fragrance included from Lancombe, Valenciaga's Britannica, Laurent Manifesto, Taylor Swift by Elizabeth Arden and Donna Karan Woman by Estée Lauder.  These are just a sampling of the high-profile launches in Fine Fragrance.
Toiletries also performed very well, reflecting major wins with global brands led by strength in Latin America and EAME.
Functional Fragrance local currency growth of 8% marked the 17th consecutive quarter of positive sales growth in this category. The solid growth was driven by continued strong momentum in Fabric Care and double-digit growth in Personal Wash.
Growth in both end-use categories was driven by strong growth in Latin America and North America, as well as growth in Greater Asia. The growth was also supported by increased sales using our proprietary encapsulation technology.
Given the strong growth we are seeing in the emerging markets, we are adding manufacturing capacity and sales and creative infrastructure to support our growing emerging markets footprint. In early September, we announced and celebrated the opening of the new state-of-the-art liquid Fragrances & Flavors manufacturing plant in, Singapore. This is part of $100 million investment in Greater Asia and replaces an existing facility.
Turning to the Ingredients. As expected, local currency sales declined by 12% due to continued volume losses in commodity products. As we've been communicating, we remain focused on finding ways to revise our participation strategy in Fragrance Ingredients, given the new reality of the market and the competitive dynamics.
Although year-over-year trends are improving, we expect to see a moderate year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.
To offset the impact of higher raw material costs on our customers, we have been proactively working with some of them to change our product formulas. Due to our vertical integration and expertise, we're able to work with them to find more sustainable alternatives. As a result, we expect to see some volumes transfer from our Fragrance Ingredients business to our Fragrance Compounds business beginning next year.
This volume transition supports our customers and IFF Compound business, creating a win-win situation. We will provide more insight early next year on the expected top line impacts, which are not expected to be material on a consolidated basis.
As you probably are aware, we report on only the portion of our Ingredient business, which is roughly 50% of the total Ingredient business. The remaining volumes is comprised of internal supply, which are ingredients that we make and use in our compounds plants. This part of the business continues to grow as we use more IFF Ingredients in our internal creation and new wins, and this increased volume is reducing the pressure on absorbing the fixed cost of our ingredient plants.
Although we achieved local currency sales growth of 5%, our reported net sales declined 1% due to the weakness of the euro and other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago.
Strong operational performance allowed the Fragrance business to more than offset this foreign exchange pressure, resulting in an 11% or $7 million increase in Fragrances segment profit to $65.3 million in the third quarter.
Our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and financial discipline, combined with an improved mix of business and continued pricing to offset higher raw material costs, enabled us to achieve margin recovery this quarter. Fragrances segment operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 17.7%, up from 15.7% a year ago.
Fragrances gross margin recovery supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level. It should be noted, however, that on a year-to-date basis, margins continue to be pressured by increased input costs, which remain at or near historical highs.
To offset this dynamic, we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives, including our Q4 2011 restructuring program and maintaining a disciplined approach towards cost management.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued momentum in our Fragrance Compound business in both Fine & Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance, supported by growth in every region. We're encouraged by the pipeline of new business wins in our Fine Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as the continued traction with our proprietary encapsulation technology.
We continue to closely monitor ingredient volume trends and believe that we will see improved volume trends in the fourth quarter, although still negative. 
With that, I will now like to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors."

Good morning, and good afternoon. This is our 27th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth.

This is our 27th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. On a like-for-like basis, over the last 3 quarters, we have delivered local currency sales growth of 6%, 9% and 9% on top of the 9% growth for the third quarter of last year.
We are proud of our results and our ability to consistently deliver strong growth metrics.
This quarter, as expected, the exit of lower margin sales activities accelerated, which had a 3-percentage-point impact on flavor sales growth, with a favorable impact on segment and company margins.
Once again, we delivered strong growth in every region and every category. Our growth was led by strong pipeline of new business wins in Beverage and Dairy, both of which achieved double-digit growth. On a like-for-like basis, Savory and Sweet also delivered solid growth in this quarter.
Our results were supported by 10% growth in the emerging markets. Our like-for-like growth in North America was 6%. Beverage and Dairy were once again the 2 best-performing categories and delivered double-digit growth.
We also saw solid growth contributions from Savory and Sweet, owing in part to our savory and sweetness modulation tools. On a like-for-like basis, our EAME region delivered local currency sales growth of 13%, led by strong growth in Dairy. EAME was our best-performing region this quarter. Western Europe continued to deliver solid performance with strong go volume growth of wins, offsetting volumes declining on existing business.
In addition, we are also delivering strong growth in the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East.  Greater Asia, our largest region, delivered a strong 8% of local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 9%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet.
In Latin America, local currency growth on a like-for-like basis was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Savory and positive growth in Dairy and Beverage.
Although we have made progress in this region, we continue to work with customer to improve our sales momentum in Latin America.
Due to our continued growth, we are making additional investment in the business to support our future growth. As Nicholas mentioned, in September, we opened a new plant in Singapore that manufacturers both Flavors and Fragrances. We are also beginning a new manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China, which will be exclusively focused on Flavors. This plant is expected to open in the first quarter of 2013.
Both the Singapore and China plants are essential to aligning our infrastructure to support our perspective capacity requirements in Greater Asia.
Last month, we announced our plans to invest over $50 million in Gebze, Turkey to expand on our existing manufacturing site and build a new leading edge creating facility. Turkey offers an unparalleled strategic hub into the fast-growing emerging market in the region that will allow us to significantly increase and differentiate our value proposition to our customers.  With respect to the significantly in our Flavors creative manufacturing capabilities in Turkey, which will provide additional support to key emerging markets.
This quarter, although our Flavors business achieved local currency sales growth of 6%. On a reported basis, our net sales were flat due to the weakness of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar versus the year ago quarter. Importantly, operating performance in our Flavors business more than offset these foreign exchange pressures.
Our gross margin recovery at the segment level supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level due to the volume gains for new business, the accelerated exit the lower margin sales activities add more favorable category mix, which more than offset higher input costs and investment to support growth initiatives, resulting in 150-basis-point increase in our segment operating margin to 22.4%.
This translated into a Flavors third quarter segment profit increase of $5 million or 7% to $76.1 million. We continue to make investment in Research & Development to support this future growth of the business and provide our customers with a leading edge technology and product quality that they expect from us.
Looking ahead, we expect that to seek continued sales momentum in the fourth quarter of 2012, led by strong growth in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low-margin sales activities.
Our consistent underlying sales growth remains strong, driven by new business wins using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers have health care. We are excited about our future growth prospect.
We've that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO."

I would like to put our financial performance into context since it is a direct result of the actions we've taken to improve the profitability of our portfolio, harness the growth of the emerging markets and create innovative and appealing new products that will help our customers to win new business and obtain market share growth.
Reported revenues for the third quarter totaled $709 million. Although sales decreased on a reported basis, on a local currency basis, they increased 5%.
The 600-basis-point foreign currency impact reflects the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies versus the year ago quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the exit of lower margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 7%, reflecting strong growth in both businesses across geographies and categories.
Approximately 70% of this growth was volume related, with a balanced pricing. As you've heard from Hernan, Flavors continued the steady cadence of positive growth, which speaks to the consistency and stability of the Flavors business. This quarter, Flavors delivered 6% local currency growth, and excluding the impact of the exit of lower margin sales activities, they delivered growth of 9%.
Our Fragrances business delivered overall local currency sales growth of 5%, reflecting strong underlying trends in many areas of the business. Importantly, Fragrance Compounds delivered local currency sales growth of 9% and increased segment profitability, reflecting cost savings initiatives, improved category mix and the net impact of increased prices and lower increases in raw material costs.
Overall, our strategic priority of leveraging the growth in the emerging markets is producing favorable results. We're seeing continued double-digit local currency sales growth in the emerging markets, which has made significant contributions to the top line of both businesses. With the growing global middle class and a desire for and availability of products that consumers use in their everyday lives.
We are very encouraged by the growth we are seeing and have made targeted investments in various areas of the globe in order to be able to continue to participate in this growth for the foreseeable future.
As we have mentioned in the past, we operate in a global environment that is see varying degrees of economic momentum. Over the course of the year, we've spoken about slowing economic growth in Western Europe and China, and we've been closely monitoring our progress in both regions.
This quarter, on a consolidated level, we saw improving trends in Western Europe, driven by our Flavors business. But we continue to see some softness in Fragrances driven by Fragrance Ingredients. Both Flavors and Fragrances showed solid growth in China.
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with our underlying growth, which led to increased margin recovery and profitability. Our gross margins expanded to 350 basis points, as been alluded to previously, to 42.5%. The improvement was primarily due to an improved mix of business in both Flavors and Fragrances, increased volume from both businesses, the exit of lower margin sales activities in Flavors and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies.
These gains, along with pricing actions, more than offset increased raw material costs. Research, selling and administrative costs increased 11% or $17 million this quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation accruals this quarter versus the year-ago quarter when provisions were lower than target.
In addition, we also had increased pension costs and investments behind growth initiatives. Importantly, our strong gross margin recovery more than offset these increased RSA expenses, resulting in a $6 million or 5% increase in adjusted operating profit to $134 million.
Interest expense declined $400,000 in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt, and other expenses decreased $3.4 million year-over-year due to gains associated with the company's deferred compensation plan assets.
As we've explained, this quarter, we took a $72.4 million charge or $0.88 per share to our net income, arising from our Spanish tax settlement that we announced on August 2. Excluding the impact of this charge, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was 27.2% versus 26.9% in the year-ago quarter.
The 30-basis-point increase primarily reflects the absence of an R&D tax credit in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.08, up from $1 in the third quarter of 2011, excluding the reversal of a restructuring charge of $0.01 per share in the prior-year quarter.
I would like to comment briefly on the top line chance we are seeing our business. On the total company basis, our local currency sales growth has increased every quarter from 1% in the first quarter to 4% in the second, to 5% this quarter. These trends are more pronounced if we exclude the impact of the exit of lower margin sales activities, which has been putting incremental pressure in our top line growth.
On a like-for-like basis, our gross increased from 1% and 5% in Q1 and Q2 to 7% in Q3. We assume the industry continues to grow at 2% to 3% overall. On a like-for-like basis, our year-to-date growth is 4%.
Looking at the business units, Flavors has shown consistent growth every quarter with 5% growth in the first quarter followed by 8% in the second and 6% in the third quarter. However, excluding the impact of the exit of low-margin business, the like-for-like sales growth has increased from 6% to 9% and 9% in the first 3 quarters of the year.  On a year-to-date basis, they have achieved 8% like-for-like growth.
Nicholas spoke of Fragrance Compounds accelerating growth. The third quarter was a robust quarter for Fragrance Compounds, and growth has improved every quarter this year to 9% in the third quarter, resulting in a 5% growth year-to-date.
Other areas of the compound business are showing continued momentum.  The only area of the remains challenged is the external portion of our Fragrance Ingredients business. However, the strength of the rest of the portfolio is more than offsetting this weakness.
Overall, we are seeing better momentum in the business. While we are cautiously optimistic, trends are improving, and underlying volumes remain strong.
I'd like to provide you with an update of our raw material costs. Although they are still increasing, they are increasing at a lower rate as we expected. Compared to the prior-year quarter, raw material costs increased 2%. That said, the third quarter of last year was the highest increase of last year at 13%.
So even though raw material costs only increased by 2% this quarter, on a 2-year basis, they are up 15%, which has continued to pressure our margins.
Year-over-year pricing benefits this quarter, while reduced versus previous quarters, has helped to somewhat reduce the margin pressure, while raw material costs remain as a significant headwind on a year-to-date basis.
Our continued margin recovery this quarter reflects strong innovations, improved product mix, cost savings initiatives and the exit of lower margin sales activities in Flavors. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe that we have reached an inflection point in our gross margins, and we are seeing this play out.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expenses as a percent of sales increased 250 basis points this quarter to 23.6%, up from 21.1% of sales last year. The year-over-year change primarily reflects increased incentive compensation accruals in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. As you may recall, last year's RSA spend was favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation accruals the to the challenging economic environment.
The level of incentive compensation we are now accruing for this year reflects our improved performance versus expectations, and it's more consistent with normalized levels of incentive compensation provisions.
Other cost increases reflect continued R&D spend on innovations and on commercial activities and other customer-facing activities to support our growth in the emerging markets.
Finally, we also incurred higher pension costs and increased our provision adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts.
The dollar remains stronger versus the euro in the third quarter versus a year ago. And as a result, foreign exchange, as we have discussed, had an approximate 600-basis-point impact on the top line. However, there was limited impact on the third quarter year-over-year operating profit margin, largely due to our cash flow hedging activities. These activities, combined with our operating improvements, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at the rate near 1 39. With current rates at around 1 28, the euro has strengthened versus where it was in the third quarter. We therefore, expect that any headwinds from foreign exchange in the fourth quarter will be negligible.
For 2013, we are nearly 70% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate 1 29.
From a cash flow perspective, for the first 9 months of the year, cash flows from operations were $143 million or 6.7% of sales compared with $117 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Importantly, the cash flow in 2012 includes a cash payment of $105.5 million this quarter related to the Spanish tax settlement and a $240 million -- $248 million cash inflow from ongoing operations.
This increased cash flow from ongoing operations in 2012 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year incentive compensation and income tax payments in 2012 versus 2011, as well as an improved earnings position.
As anticipated, capital expenditures are increasing, in line with our guidance due to the investments we've made in Singapore and China. And we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full year 2012.
The Singapore plant, which opened in early September, manufacturers both Flavors and Fragrances liquid compounds. The Guangzhou, China plant will open early next year and will be exclusively Flavors focused.
And as noted by Hernan, in addition last month, we announced $50 million plus investment in expanding Flavors manufacturing facility and building a creative center in Gebze, Turkey. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

We are pleased with the progress we've made over the past few quarters. The diverse and nature of our business, combined with our customer intimacy and consumer insights, enabled us to deliver strong results in a challenged environment.
Although we are mindful of economic volatility in various parts of the world, we are confident that based on our diversification, we will be able to offset softness in one part of our business, with strengths in another part of the business world.
The accelerated momentum we see in the Flavor & Fragrance Compounds business is fueled by the strategic investments we have made in the emerging markets over many years, combined with our ability to provide customers with products that meet and surpass consumer expectation and lead to market share growth for both our customers and for us.
We are committed to driving the business for the long-term and executing our growth plans. IFF's operations were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, resulting in short-term disruptions into our, manufacturing and in our information technology systems.
I am pleased to say that most of these disruptions have now been resolved due to the rapid reaction of our employees in implementing our disaster recovery plans. We are currently in the process of estimating the impact of the storm on our business. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our fourth quarter financial results.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued strong local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the continued acceleration of the exit of low-margin sales activities. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to continue in Fine & Beauty Care while also maintaining solid growth in Functional. We expect to see improving volume trends in Ingredients business in the fourth quarter, although we still expect year-over-year moderate volume declines.
With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material costs will continue to stabilize at the current rates, which as Kevin has pointed out, when combined with last year's trends, still results in historically high levels of input costs. Given our progress on the number of initiatives, we expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year-ago levels.
We have a committed and dedicated group of people whose mission is to see the company succeed. We are pushing ahead to meet our internal profit objectives despite the headwinds mentioned. Excluding the costs related to the impact of the hurricane, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in line with current market consensus for the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, our strong performance at IFF this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity and our ability to work with our customers year in and year out to develop new products that help shape the industry and delight consumers.
Going forward, we expect to continued momentum and growth. We will continue to proactively manage our performance and calibrate costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.
With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have. Thank you for your participation."

I think we said in the past that we don't consider there to be a great level of variability as we look forward into 2013. And I'll leave it at that at this particular point in time. But certainly, it's a much more stable environment than we've seen in the past. So I'll leave it at that at this particular point in time. In terms of the investments in our factories, clearly, these are investments that are capacity oriented and supporting our future growth initiatives, largely in Greater Asia. The recent Turkey announcement is supporting other parts of the emerging market portfolio that we have. But clearly, they are about increasing our capacities. There are efficiencies embedded into those plants, but at the same token, there will be some incremental depreciation that we have at this particular point in time as well. Having said all of that, we will continue to try and drive incremental efficiencies into our business. And as you see through the initiative that we have in recognizing the third quarter gross margin progression, it's a wide swath of efforts, including some pricing but also new wins, good margins on those new wins and working on price and cost efficiencies with our factories. And that will continue to be a focus as we go forward."

I think that again, as outlined in the prepared comments and some earlier comments, there was a wide swath of things that were driving our gross margin. But certainly, pricing helped to offset the incremental input costs that we talked about. It really wasn't the primary driver, the net pricing versus input costs was not the driver to our margins. Volume and mix certainly was a key determinant of that, and that's certainly helped to provide a big chunk of the benefits. And I think also, the cost savings initiatives were also important, and that is just the blocking and tackling of running the business where we saw some good progress again in Fragrances where they were able to reduce some costs in their business. Hernan and their team, obviously, have been managing through the exit of some of the lower margin, and that benefit approached 50 basis points for the company as well. So there certainly was a wide range of issues that were executed, our opportunities that were executed the guidance, which allowed us to deliver the strong margin profile. So it just wasn't about the pricing, even though that continued to be an important element to help reduce some of the pressure from input costs."

And that's why we are really driving higher consumption of hybrid ingredients in our new wins, in our creation in order to have a better absorption. It is also fair to say that the Ingredient part of our business has been probably one of the most efficient in terms of manufacturing, so we're definitely getting opportunities to reduce costs and to bring it in line with some of the challenge. But we also continue to develop solutions that will be sharing with the board as we move forward and develop alternatives to adopt to our costs to the new reality of the market.

That maximization of the portfolio is both that's really where the concept low from, it was to really focus much on growing where we could. And you can see in both the Fine discussion Nicolas has had and some of the categories that have been discussed, we've got some priority categories, and they're broadly doing well and contributing to that goal. The third plank was that if we couldn't fix things, we would exit businesses. And that was a little bit of that in Fragrances in previous quarters. The focus really for the company in the last few quarters has been on Flavors. And Hernan has touched upon that, and Kevin has just mentioned the benefit of margin we get from exiting. Exiting was a last resort, but nevertheless, you can see the company's positive traction and margin recovery from having exited the business and still having some good top line growth. The second plank and really the most interesting one where we've candidly been treading water and while that's disappointing in the absolute, I think the particular is around the factor are important. The treading water was really around some categories in Functional Fragrance in the Fragrances businesses. And the treading water was yet application of the need to fix some businesses. And candidly, the team have really taken some excellent actions to move the progress to had, but we have been had by a significant raw material cost increases over the last couple of years. So it's a function of taking some pricing with customers, revising some formulas, doing some things we inside the company called ""value creation,"" which is streamlining the business. We've done a number of things, all of which have been positive in terms of margin recovery, but they've been offset by the, if you will, the tsunami of the raw material cost increases in the last couple of years. So since that meeting, we probably made very little traction despite some recently strong actions. But at this growth categories we're still doing that, we will exit some low margin, but that fixed Functional we've made some little progress. We've still got more to do, but it's been a great experience. And had we not frankly been able to engender some of the successes have just talked about in the light of the cost increases, the margin would have been extremely negative."

Our focus on the call this morning is a review our third quarter results and a short discussion on our outlook for the remainder of the year.
As a company with significant operations in New York and in New Jersey, we are very well aware of the impact that Hurricane Sandy has had on people in the area. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to everyone who was affected by the storm, including our own numerous employees in the region.
The solid growth we achieved this third quarter is due to the strategic priorities we have implemented over the past few years to deliver profitable growth by improving the profitability of our product portfolio, strengthening our innovation platform and leveraging our geographic reach. You have heard us say many times that the diversity of our business model in terms of geographies and use categories and customers helps to provide us with stable results in good times and bad.
This quarter, we are seeing the cumulative effect of our strategy, combined with the diversity of our business model, resulting in solid momentum and strong growth in both Flavors and Fragrances even with ongoing economic uncertainty in many parts of the world. We are very pleased with our progress and encouraged by our results and believe we are on the right path. 
Both our Flavors and Fragrances Compounds businesses delivered strong top line growth and margin recovery this quarter, and we saw strong contributions to overall profitability from both our businesses.
For the total company, we delivered top line local currency sales growth of 5%, which is the highest quarterly sales growth we have seen since the first quarter of 2011. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of the exit of low-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was in fact higher at 7%.
This quarter, we continue to execute on our plan to exit lower-margin sales activities in Flavors. We also saw a better mix of business, both in the developed and in the emerging markets. 
As expected, we are seeing lower increases in raw material costs, although they remain at elevated levels and we continue to take pricing.  These factors, in addition to ongoing manufacturing efficiencies and other elements, such as product mix and new business wins, resulted in gross margin expansion of 350 basis points this quarter to 42.5%, up from 39% in the prior year quarter.
Our adjusted operating profit increased $6 million, or 5%, to $164 million -- $134 million in the third quarter compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2011. Also, our adjusted operating profit margins expanded 100 basis points this quarter to 18.9% compared with 17.9% in the year ago quarter.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.20 per share. The GAAP number includes an $0.88 charge arising from our settlement with the Spanish tax authorities earlier in the quarter. Excluding this charge as well as the $0.01 per share reversal of a restructuring charge in the prior year quarter, our adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08. This quarter marks the second consecutive quarter in which we were able to deliver solid EPS growth on an adjusted basis despite the challenging economic environment. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the favorable trends we are seeing in both our top line and bottom line growth. 
I will now turn the call over to Nicolas and Hernan, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin, our CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sections, I will give you some perspective on the outlook for the balance of the year. With that, I'd like to introduce Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

In terms of our sales performance, we saw accelerating growth in many areas of the business. Local currency sales growth for the Fragrance business was 5% in the third quarter. Fragrance Compounds grew by 9% in local currency, fueled by 10% growth in Fine & Beauty Care and 8% growth in Functional Fragrance. We attribute our success to the strength of our strategic relationships with our customers, our knowledge and insight into consumer preferences and our ability to provide superior product that meet customer needs.
I want to focus on some of the positive trends we are seeing, and there are many. Over the past 3 quarters, Fragrance Compound local currency sales growth has accelerated in every quarter. We grew from the 1% decline in the first quarter to a 6% increase in the second quarter to a 9% increase in the third quarter. This growth in Fragrance Compounds was led by 17% growth in Latin America, 8% growth in North America and 7% growth in EAME. We are very encouraged by the results that we're seeing. In terms of drivers, Fragrances' growth this quarter was driven by a strong pipeline of new wins, continued pricing and lower volume declines on existing business.
On a category basis, Fine & Beauty Care achieved 10% local currency sales growth led by strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Toiletries. This quarter, new launches in Fine Fragrance included La Vie Est Belle from Lancome; Balenciaga's Florabotanica; Yves Saint Laurent, Manifesto; Taylor Swift by Elizabeth Arden and Donna Karan WOMAN by Estée Lauder. These are just a sampling of the high-profile launches in Fine Fragrance.
Toiletries also performed very well, reflecting major wins with global brands, led by strength in Latin America and EAME.
Functional Fragrance local currency growth of 8% marked the 17th consecutive quarter of positive sales growth in this category. The solid growth was driven by continued strong momentum in Fabric Care and double-digit growth in Personal Wash.
Growth in both end-use categories was driven by strong growth in Latin America and North America, as well as growth in Greater Asia. The growth was also supported by increased sales using our proprietary encapsulation technology.
Given the strong growth we are seeing in the emerging markets, we are adding manufacturing capacity and sales and creative infrastructure to support our growing emerging market footprint. In early September, we announced and celebrated the opening of a new state-of-the-art liquid Fragrance and Flavors manufacturing plant in Jurong, Singapore. This is part of the $100 million investment in Greater Asia and replaces an existing facility.
Turning to the Ingredients. As expected, local currency sales declined by 12% due to continued volume losses in commodity products. As we've been communicating, we remain focused on finding ways to revise our participation strategy in Fragrance Ingredients given the new realities of the market and the competitive dynamics. Although year-over-year trends are improving, we expect to see a moderate year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.
To offset the impact of high raw material costs on our customers, we have been proactively working with some of them to change our product formulas. Due to our vertical integration and expertise, we're able to work with them to find more sustainable alternatives. As a result, we expect to see some volumes transfer from our Fragrance Ingredient business to our Fragrance Compound business beginning next year. This volume transition supports our customers and IFF Compound business, creating a win-win situation. We will provide more insight early next year on the expected top line impacts, which are not expected to be material on a consolidated basis.
As you probably are aware, we report on only the external portion of our Ingredient business, which is roughly 50% of the total Ingredient business. The remaining volume is comprised of internal supply, which are ingredients that we make and use in our Compounds plants. This part of the business continues to grow as we use more IFF ingredients in our internal creations and new wins, and this increased volume is reducing the pressure on absorbing the fixed cost of our ingredient plants.
Although we achieved local currency sales growth of 5%, our reported net sales declined 1% due to the weakness of the euro and other currencies related to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. Strong operational performance allowed the Fragrance business to more than offset this foreign exchange pressure, resulting in an 11%, or $7 million, increase in Fragrance segment profit to $65.3 million in the third quarter.
Our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and financial discipline, combined with an improved mix of business and continued pricing to offset higher raw material costs, enabled us to achieve margin recovery this quarter. Fragrance segment operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 17.7%, up from 15.7% a year ago.
Fragrance gross margin recovery supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level. It should be noted, however, that on a year-to-date basis, margins continue to be pressured by increased input costs, which remain at or near historical highs. To offset this dynamic, we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives, including our Q4 2011 restructuring program, and maintaining a disciplined approach toward cost management.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued momentum in our Fragrance Compound business in both Fine & Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance, supported by growth in every region. We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business wins in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories as well as the continued traction with our proprietary encapsulation technology.
We continue to closely monitor ingredient volume trends and believe that we will see improved volume trends in the fourth quarter, although still negative. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors."

Good morning and good afternoon. This is our 27th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth.

This is our 27th consecutive quarter of local currency sales growth. On a like-for-like basis, over the last 3 quarters, we have delivered local currency sales growth of 6%, 9% and 9% on top of the 9% growth for the third quarter of last year.
We are proud of the -- our results and our ability to consistently deliver strong growth metrics.
This quarter, as expected, the exit of low-margin sales activities accelerated, which had a 3-percentage-point impact on Flavor sales growth, but a favorable impact on segment and company margins.
Once again, we delivered strong growth in every region and every category. Our growth was led by strong pipeline of new business wins in Beverage and Dairy, both of which achieved double-digit growth. On a like-for-like basis, Savory and Sweet also delivered solid growth in this quarter.
Our results were supported by 10% growth in the emerging markets. Our like-for-like growth in North America was 6%. Beverage and Dairy were once again the 2 best-performing categories and delivered double-digit growth. We also saw solid growth contributions from Savory and Sweet, owing in part to our savory and sweetness modulation tools. 
On a like-for-like basis, our EAME region delivered local currency sales growth of 13% led by strong growth in Dairy. EAME was our best-performing region this quarter. Western Europe continued to deliver solid performance with a strong volume growth from wins offsetting volumes declining on existing business. In addition, we are also delivering strong growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East. Greater Asia, our largest region, delivered strong 8% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 9%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high, single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet. In Latin America, local currency growth on a like-for-like basis was 6% led by double-digit growth in Savory and positive growth in Dairy and Beverage. Although we have made progress in this region, we continue to work with customer to improve our sales momentum in Latin America.
Due to our continued growth, we are making additional investment in the business to support our future growth. As Nicholas mentioned, in September, we opened a new plant in Singapore that manufacturers both flavors and fragrances. We are also beginning a new manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China, which will be exclusively focused on Flavors. This plant is expected to open in the first quarter of 2013. Both the Singapore and China plants are essential to aligning our infrastructure to support our respective [ph] capacity requirements in Greater Asia.
Last month, we announced our plans to invest over $50 million in Gebze, Turkey to expand on our existing manufacturing site and build a new leading-edge creative facility. Turkey offers an unparalleled strategic hub into the fast-growing emerging market in the region that will allow us to significantly increase and differentiate our value proposition to our customers. We expect to invest significantly in our Flavors creative and manufacturing capabilities in Turkey, which will provide additional support to key emerging markets.
This quarter, although our Flavors business achieved local currency sales growth of 6%, on a reported basis, our net sales were flat due to the weakness of other currencies versus the U.S. dollars versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, operating performance in our Flavor business more than offset these foreign exchange pressures.
Our gross margin recovery at the segment level supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level due to volume gains for new business, the accelerated exit of lower-margin sales activities add more favorable category mix, which more than offset higher input costs and investment to support growth initiatives, resulting in 150-basis-point increase in our segment operating margin to 22.4%. This translated into a Flavors third quarter segment profit increase of $5 million, or 7%, to $76.1 million. We continue to make investment in Research & Development to support the future growth of the business and provide our customers with the leading-edge technology and product quality that they expect from us.
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued sales momentum in the fourth quarter of 2012 led by strong growth in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low-margin sales activities.
Our consistent underlying sales growth remained strong, driven by new business wins using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers' end products healthier. We are excited about our future growth prospect.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO."

I would like to put our financial performance into context since it is a direct result of the actions we've taken to improve the profitability of our portfolio, harness the growth of the emerging markets and create innovative and appealing, new products that will help our customers to win new business and obtain market share growth.
Reported revenues for the third quarter totaled $709 million. Although sales decreased on a reported basis, on a local currency basis, they increased 5%.
The 600-basis-point foreign currency impact reflects the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies versus the year-ago quarter. 
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 7%, reflecting strong growth in both businesses, across geographies and categories. Approximately 70% of this growth was volume related with a balanced pricing. 
As you've heard from Hernan, Flavors continued their steady cadence of positive growth, which speaks to the consistency and stability of the Flavors business. This quarter, Flavors delivered 6% local currency growth. And excluding the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, they delivered growth of 9%.
Our Fragrances business delivered overall local currency sales growth of 5%, reflecting strong underlying trends in many areas of the business. Importantly, Fragrance Compounds delivered local currency sales growth of 9% and increased segment profitability, reflecting cost savings initiatives, improved category mix and the net impact of increased prices and lower increases in raw material costs.
Overall, our strategic priority of leveraging the growth in the emerging markets is producing favorable results. We're seeing continued double-digit local currency sales growth in the emerging markets, which has made significant contributions to the top line of both businesses, with a growing global middle class and a desire for, and availability of, products that consumers use in their everyday lives. We are very encouraged by the growth we are seeing and have made targeted investments in various areas of the globe in order to be able to continue to participate in this growth for the foreseeable future.
As we have mentioned in the past we operate in a global environment that has seen varying degrees of economic momentum. Over the course of the year, we've spoken about slowing economic growth in Western Europe and China, and we've been closely monitoring our progress in both regions. This quarter, on a consolidated level, we saw improving trends in Western Europe driven by our Flavors business. But we continue to see some softness in Fragrances driven by Fragrance Ingredients. Both Flavors and Fragrances showed solid growth in China.
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with our underlying growth, which led to increased margin recovery and profitability. Our gross margins expanded to 350 basis points that has been alluded to previously, to 42.5%. The improvement was primarily due to an improved mix of business in both Flavors and Fragrances, increased volume from both businesses, the exit of lower-margin sales activities in Flavors and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. These gains, along with pricing actions, more than offset increased raw material costs. 
Research, selling and administrative costs increased 11% or $17 million this quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation accruals this quarter versus the year-ago quarter when provisions were lower than target. In addition, we also had increased pension costs and investments behind growth initiatives. Importantly, our strong gross margin recovery more than offset these increased RSA expenses, resulting in a $6 million or 5% increase in adjusted operating profit to $134 million.
Interest expense declined $400,000 in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt. And other expenses decreased $3.4 million year-over-year due to gains associated with the company's deferred compensation plan assets.
As we've explained, this quarter, we took a $72.4 million charge, or $0.88 per share, to net income, arising from our Spanish tax settlement that we announced on August 2. Excluding the impact of this charge, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was 27.2% versus 26.9% in the year-ago quarter. The 30-basis-point increase primarily reflects the absence of an R&D tax credit in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2012. 
Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.08, up from $1 in the third quarter of 2011, excluding the reversal of a restructuring charge of $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter.
I would like to comment briefly on the top line trends we are seeing in our business. On a total company basis, our local currency sales growth has increased every quarter: from 1% in the first quarter to 4% in the second, to 5% this quarter. These trends are more pronounced if we exclude the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, which has been putting incremental pressure on our top line growth. On a like-for-like basis, our growth increased from 1% and 5% in Q1 and Q2 to 7% in Q3. We assume the industry continues to grow at 2% to 3% overall. On a like-for-like basis, our year-to-date growth is 4%.
Looking at the business units, Flavors has shown consistent growth every quarter with 5% growth in the first quarter followed by 8% in the second and 6% in the third quarter. However, excluding the impact of the exit of low-margin business, the like-for-like sales growth has increased from 6% to 9% and 9% in the first 3 quarters of the year.  On a year-to-date basis, they have achieved 8% like-for-like growth.
Nicolas spoke of Fragrance Compounds' accelerating growth. The third quarter was a robust quarter for Fragrance Compounds, and growth has improved every quarter this year to 9% in the third quarter, resulting in a 5% growth year-to-date. All areas of the Compound business are showing continued momentum.  The only area that remains challenged is the external portion of our Fragrance Ingredients business. However, the strength of the rest of the portfolio is more than offsetting this weakness.
Overall, we are seeing better momentum in the business. While we are cautiously optimistic, trends are improving, and underlying volumes remain strong.
I'd like to provide you with an update of our raw material costs. Although they are still increasing, they are increasing at a lower rate, as we expected. Compared to the prior year quarter, raw material costs increased 2%. That said, the third quarter of last year was the highest increase of last year at 13%. So even though raw material costs only increased by 2% this quarter, on a 2-year basis, they are up 15%, which has continued to pressure our margins.
Year-over-year pricing benefits this quarter, while reduced versus previous quarters, have helped to somewhat reduce the margin pressure, while raw material costs remain as a significant headwind on a year-to-date basis.
Our continued margin recovery this quarter reflects strong innovations, improved product mix, cost savings initiatives and the exit of lower-margin sales activities in Flavors. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe that we have reached an inflection point in our gross margins, and we are seeing this play out.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percent of sales increased 250 basis points this quarter to 23.6%, up from 21.1% of sales last year. The year-over-year change primarily reflects increased incentive compensation accruals in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. As you may recall, last year's RSA spend was favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation accruals due to the challenging economic environment. The level of incentive compensation we are now accruing for this year reflects our improved performance versus expectations and is more consistent with normalized levels of incentive compensation provisions. Other cost increases reflect continued R&D spend on innovation and on commercial activities and other customer-facing activities to support our growth in the emerging markets. Finally, we also incurred higher pension costs and increased our provision adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts.
The dollar remained stronger versus the euro in the third quarter versus a year ago. And as a result, foreign exchange, as we have discussed, had an approximate 600-basis-point impact on the top line. However, there was limited impact on the third quarter year-over-year operating profit margin largely due to our cash flow hedging activities. These activities, combined with our other operating improvements, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at the rate near $1.39. With current rates at around $1.28, the euro had strengthened versus where it was in the third quarter. We therefore expect that any headwinds from foreign exchange in the fourth quarter will be negligible. For 2013, we are nearly 70% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.29.
From a cash flow perspective, for the first 9 months of the year, cash flows from operations were $143 million, or 6.7% of sales, compared with $117 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Importantly, the cash flow in 2012 includes a cash payment of $105.5 million this quarter related to the Spanish tax settlement and a $240 million -- $248 million cash inflow from ongoing operations.
This increased cash flow from ongoing operations in 2012 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year incentive compensation and income tax payments in 2012 versus 2011, as well as an improved earnings position.
As anticipated, capital expenditures are increasing, in line with our guidance, due to the investments we've made in Singapore and China. And we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full year 2012. The Singapore plant, which opened in early September, manufactures both Flavors and Fragrances liquid compounds. The Guangzhou, China plant will open early next year and will be exclusively Flavors focused. 
And as noted by Hernan, in addition last month, we announced a $50 million-plus investment in expanding Flavors' manufacturing facility and building a creative center in Gebze, Turkey. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

We are pleased with the progress we've made over the past few quarters. The diverse and stable nature of our business, combined with our customer intimacy and consumer insights, enabled us to deliver strong results in a challenged environment.
Although we are mindful of economic volatility in various parts of the world, we are confident that based on our diversification, we will be able to offset softness in one part of our business with strengths in another part of the business world.
The accelerated momentum we see in the Flavor and Fragrance Compounds business is fueled by the strategic investments we had made in the emerging markets over many years, combined with our ability to provide customers with products that meet and surpass consumer expectation and lead to market share growth for both our customers and for us.
We are committed to driving the business for the long term and executing on our growth plans. 
IFF's operations were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, resulting in short-term disruptions in power, manufacturing and in our information technology systems. I am pleased to say that most of these disruptions have now been resolved due to the rapid reaction of our employees in implementing our disaster recovery plans. We are currently in the process of estimating the impact of the storm on our business. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our fourth quarter financial results.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued strong local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the continued acceleration and exit of low-margin sales activities. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to continue in Fine & Beauty Care while also maintaining solid growth in Functional. We expect to see improving volume trends in Ingredients business in the fourth quarter, although we still expect year-over-year moderate volume declines.
With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material costs will continue to stabilize at the current rates, which, as Kevin has pointed out, when combined with last year's trends still results in historically high levels of input costs. Given our progress on a number of initiatives, we expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year-ago levels.
We have a committed and dedicated group of people whose mission is to see the company succeed. We are pushing ahead to meet our internal profit objectives despite the headwinds mentioned. Excluding the costs related to the impact of the hurricane, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in line with current market consensus for the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, our strong performance at IFF this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity and our ability to work with our customers year in and year out to develop new products that help shape the industry and delight consumers.
Going forward, we expect continued momentum and growth. We will continue to proactively manage our performance and calibrate costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.
With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have. Thank you for your participation."

So I wanted to just see like what's the benefit of restructuring savings and other cost efficiencies may have been to your gross margin line, if you can quantify it. And secondly, I also have a question regarding -- just I wanted to get the update as to what has been done on the Ingredients side to better match the costs with the lower sales base of the business."

Let me take a stab and then I'll turn it over to any my colleagues who want to add any additional color. I think that again, as outlined in the prepared comments and some earlier comments, there was a wide swath of things that were driving our gross margin. But certainly, pricing helped to offset the incremental input costs that we talked about. It really wasn't the primary driver. The net pricing versus input costs was not the driver to our margins. Volume and mix certainly was -- were the key determinant of that, and that certainly helped to provide a big chunk of the benefits. And I think also, the cost savings initiatives were also important, and that is just the blocking and tackling, of running the business where we saw some good progress again in Fragrance where they were able to reduce some costs in their business. Hernan and their team, obviously, have been managing through the exit of some of the lower margin, and that benefit approached 50 basis points for the company as well. So there certainly was a wide range of issues that were executed, or opportunities that were executed against, which allowed us to deliver the strong margin profile. So it just wasn't about the pricing even though that continued to be an important element to help reduce some of the pressure from input costs."

Regarding Ingredients, as we have been saying in the past, I mean, following the strategy review of the portfolio, we concluded that the Ingredients business was and still continue to be of strategic and financial importance to us, and the #1 priority of the business is to provide cost-advantage ingredients to our Compound business. And that's why we're really driving higher consumption of IFF ingredients in our new wins, in our creation in order to have a better absorption. It is also fair to say that the Ingredient part of our business has been probably one of the most efficient in terms of manufacturing. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to reduce costs and to bring it in line with some of the challenge. But we'll also continue to develop solution and -- that we will be sharing with the Board as we move forward and develop alternatives to adopt to our costs, to the new reality of the market. One thing that I wanted to add and I want to make sure also following the question from Edward is that with the transfer of some of the ingredients into Compounds, we will see a lower Ingredients top line sales in the future in 2013 as we're migrating business from Ingredients to Compounds."

And while we haven't disclosed the number, I'll take you through the 3 planks that we had then and we have now. And it's been an interesting evolution. That maximization of the portfolio is both -- that's really where the concept flowed from. It was to really focus as much on growing where we could. And you can see in both the Fine discussion Nicolas has had and some of the categories that Hernan discussed, we've got some priority categories, and they're broadly doing well and contributing to that goal. The third plank was that if we couldn't fix things, we would exit businesses. And that was a little bit of that in Fragrances in previous quarters. The focus really for the company in the last few quarters has been on Flavors. And Hernan touched upon that, and Kevin has just mentioned the benefit of margin we get from exiting. Exiting was a last resort. But nevertheless, you can see the company's positive traction and margin recovery from having exited the business and still having some good top line growth. The second plank, and really the most interesting one and where we've candidly been treading water, and while that's disappointing in the absolute, I think the particulars around the factor are important. But treading water was really around some categories in Functional Fragrance in the Fragrance businesses. And the treading water was a ramification [ph] of the need to fix some businesses. And candidly, the team had really taken some excellent actions to move, to progress ahead, but we have been hit by significant raw material cost increases over the last couple of years. So it's a function of taking some pricing with customers, revising some formulas, doing some things we inside the company call ""some value creation,"" which is streamlining the business. We've done a number of things, all of which have been positive in terms of margin recovery, but they've been offset by the, if you will, the tsunami of the raw material cost increases in the last couple of years. So since that meeting, we've probably made very little traction despite some recently strong actions. But if this grow-the-categories, we're still doing that, we will exit some low margin. But that fixed Functional, we've made some -- little progress. We've still got more to do, but it's been a great experience. And had we not, frankly, been able to engender some of the successes I just talked about in the light of the cost increases, the margin would have been extremely negative."

Our focus on the call this morning is a review of our third quarter results and a short discussion on our outlook for the remainder of the year.
As a company with significant operations in New York and in New Jersey, we are very well aware of the impact that Hurricane Sandy has had on people in the area. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to everyone who was affected by this storm, including our own numerous employees in the region.
The solid growth we achieved this third quarter is due to the strategic priorities we have implemented over the past few years to deliver profitable growth, by improving the profitability of our product portfolio, strengthening our innovation platform and leveraging our geographic reach. You have heard us say many times that the diversity of our business model, in terms of geographies and use categories and customers, helps to provide us with stable results in good times and bad.
This quarter, we are seeing the cumulative effect of our strategy, combined with the diversity of our business model, resulting in solid momentum and strong growth in both Flavors and Fragrances even with ongoing economic uncertainty in many parts of the world. We are very pleased with our progress and encouraged by our results and believe we are on the right path. 
Both our Flavors and Fragrances Compounds businesses delivered strong top line growth and margin recovery this quarter, and we saw strong contributions to overall profitability from both our businesses.
For the total company, we delivered top line local currency sales growth of 5%, which is the highest quarterly sales growth we have seen since the first quarter of 2011. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of the exit of low-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was, in fact, higher at 7%.
This quarter, we continued to execute on our plan to exit lower-margin sales activities in Flavors. We also saw a better mix of business, both in the developed and in the emerging markets. 
As expected, we are seeing lower increases in raw material costs, although they remain at elevated levels and we continue to take pricing.  These factors, in addition to ongoing manufacturing efficiencies and other elements, such as product mix and new business wins, resulted in gross margin expansion of 350 basis points this quarter to 42.5%, up from 39% in the prior year quarter.
Our adjusted operating profit increased $6 million, or 5%, to $164 million -- $134 million in the third quarter compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2011. Also, our adjusted operating profit margins expanded 100 basis points this quarter to 18.9% compared with 17.9% in the year ago quarter.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.20 per share. The GAAP number includes an $0.88 charge arising from our settlement with the Spanish tax authorities earlier in the quarter. Excluding this charge as well as the $0.01 per share reversal of a restructuring charge in the prior year quarter, our adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.08. This quarter marks the second consecutive quarter in which we were able to deliver solid EPS growth on an adjusted basis despite the challenging economic environment. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the favorable trends we are seeing in both our top line and bottom line growth. 
I will now turn the call over to Nicolas and Hernan, who will provide you with an update on the progress of our business units, and then to Kevin, our CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance. After their respective sections, I will give you some perspective on the outlook for the balance of the year. With that, I'd like to introduce Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz."

We achieved solid results in many areas of the business, and overall trends are improving. Our ability to execute on our plan is illustrated by both our top line growth as well as our recovering profitability.
In terms of our sales performance, we saw accelerating growth in many areas of the business. Local currency sales growth for the Fragrance business was 5% in the third quarter. Fragrance Compounds grew by 9% in local currency, fueled by 10% growth in Fine & Beauty Care and 8% growth in Functional Fragrance. We attribute our success to the strength of our strategic relationships with our customers, our knowledge and insight into consumer preferences and our ability to provide superior product that meet customer needs.
I want to focus on some of the positive trends we are seeing, and there are many. Over the past 3 quarters, Fragrance Compound local currency sales growth has accelerated in every quarter. We grew from the 1% decline in the first quarter to a 6% increase in the second quarter to a 9% increase in the third quarter. This growth in Fragrance Compounds was led by 17% growth in Latin America, 8% growth in North America and 7% growth in EAME. We are very encouraged by the results that we're seeing. In terms of drivers, Fragrances' growth this quarter was driven by a strong pipeline of new wins, continued pricing and lower volume declines on existing business.
On a category basis, Fine & Beauty Care achieved 10% local currency sales growth, led by strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Toiletries. This quarter, new launches in Fine Fragrance included La Vie Est Belle from Lancome; Balenciaga's Florabotanica; Yves Saint Laurent's Manifesto; Taylor Swift by Elizabeth Arden and Donna Karan WOMAN by Estée Lauder. These are just a sampling of the high-profile launches in Fine Fragrance.
Toiletries also performed very well, reflecting major wins with global brands, led by strength in Latin America and EAME.
Functional Fragrance local currency growth of 8% marked the 17th consecutive quarter of positive sales growth in this category. The solid growth was driven by continued strong momentum in Fabric Care and double-digit growth in Personal Wash.
Growth in both end-use categories was driven by strong growth in Latin America and North America, as well as growth in Greater Asia. The growth was also supported by increased sales using our proprietary encapsulation technology.
Given the strong growth we are seeing in the emerging markets, we are adding manufacturing capacity and sales and creative infrastructure to support our growing emerging market footprint. In early September, we announced and celebrated the opening of a new state-of-the-art liquid Fragrances and Flavors manufacturing plant in Jurong, Singapore. This is part of the $100 million investment in Greater Asia and replaces an existing facility.
Turning to Ingredients. As expected, local currency sales declined by 12% due to continued volume losses in commodity products. As we've been communicating, we remain focused on finding ways to revise our participation strategy in Fragrance Ingredients given the new realities of the market and the competitive dynamics. Although year-over-year trends are improving, we expect to see a moderate year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.
To offset the impact of high raw material costs on our customers, we have been proactively working with some of them to change their product formulas. Due to our vertical integration and expertise, we're able to work with them to find more sustainable alternatives. As a result, we expect to see some volumes transfer from our Fragrance Ingredient business to our Fragrance Compound business beginning next year. This volume transition supports our customers and IFF Compound business, creating a win-win situation. We will provide more insight early next year on the expected top line impacts, which are not expected to be material on a consolidated basis.
As you probably are aware, we report on only the external portion of our Ingredient business, which is roughly 50% of the total Ingredient business. The remaining volume is comprised of internal supply, which are ingredients that we make and use in our Compounds plants. This part of the business continues to grow as we use more IFF ingredients in our internal creations and new wins, and this increased volume is reducing the pressure on absorbing the fixed cost of our Ingredient plants.
Although we achieved local currency sales growth of 5%, our reported net sales declined 1% due to the weakness of the euro and other currencies related to the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. Strong operational performance allowed the Fragrance business to more than offset this foreign exchange pressure, resulting in an 11%, or $7 million, increase in Fragrance segment profit to $65.3 million in the third quarter.
Our continued focus on cost savings initiatives and financial discipline, combined with an improved mix of business and continued pricing to offset higher raw material costs, enabled us to achieve margin recovery this quarter. Fragrance segment operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 17.7%, up from 15.7% a year ago.
Fragrance gross margin recovery supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level. It should be noted, however, that on a year-to-date basis, margins continue to be pressured by increased input costs, which remain at or near historical highs. To offset this dynamic, we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives, including our Q4 2011 restructuring program, and maintaining a disciplined approach toward cost management.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued momentum in our Fragrance Compound business in both Fine & Beauty Care and Functional Fragrance, supported by growth in every region. We are encouraged by the pipeline of new business wins in our Fine & Beauty Care and Functional categories, as well as the continued traction with our proprietary encapsulation technology.
We continue to closely monitor Ingredient volume trends and believe that we will see improved volume trends in the fourth quarter, although still negative. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Hernan Vaisman, our President of Flavors."

Our results were supported by 10% growth in the emerging markets. Our like-for-like growth in North America was 6%. Beverage and Dairy were once again the 2 best-performing categories and delivered double-digit growth. We also saw solid growth contributions from Savory and Sweet, owing in part to our savory and sweetness modulation tools. 
On a like-for-like basis, our EAME region delivered local currency sales growth of 13% led by strong growth in Dairy. EAME was our best-performing region this quarter. Western Europe continued to deliver solid performance with a strong volume growth from wins offsetting volumes declining on existing business. In addition, we are also delivering strong growth in the emerging market of Africa and the Middle East. Greater Asia, our largest region, delivered strong 8% local currency growth. On a like-for-like basis, Greater Asia grew at 9%. This growth was led by double-digit growth in Dairy and high single-digit growth in Beverage, Savory and Sweet. In Latin America, local currency growth on a like-for-like basis was 6%, led by double-digit growth in Savory and positive growth in Dairy and Beverage. Although we have made progress in this region, we continue to work with the customer to improve our sales momentum in Latin America.
Due to our continued growth, we are making additional investment in the business to support our future growth. As Nicholas mentioned, in September, we opened a new plant in Singapore that manufactures both flavors and fragrances. We are also beginning a new manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China, which will be exclusively focused on Flavors. This plant is expected to open in the first quarter of 2013. Both the Singapore and China plants are essential to aligning our infrastructure to support our projected capacity requirements in Greater Asia.
Last month, we announced our plans to invest over $50 million in Gebze, Turkey to expand on our existing manufacturing site and build a new leading-edge creative facility. Turkey offers an unparalleled strategic hub into the fast-growing emerging market in the region that will allow us to significantly increase and differentiate our value proposition to our customers. We expect to invest significantly in our Flavors creative and manufacturing capabilities in Turkey, which will provide additional support to key emerging markets.
This quarter, although our Flavors business achieved local currency sales growth of 6% on a reported basis, our net sales were flat due to the weakness of other currencies versus the U.S. dollars versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, operating performance in our Flavor business more than offset these foreign exchange pressures.
Our gross margin recovery at the segment level supported gross margin expansion at the consolidated level due to volume gains for new business, the accelerated exit of lower-margin sales activities and more favorable category mix, which more than offset higher input costs and investment to support growth initiatives, resulting in 150-basis-point increase in our segment operating margin to 22.4%. This translated into a Flavors third quarter segment profit increase of $5 million, or 7%, to $76.1 million. We continue to make investment in Research & Development to support the future growth of the business and provide our customers with the leading-edge technology and product quality that they expect from us.
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued sales momentum in the fourth quarter of 2012 led by strong growth in the emerging markets, offset in part by the accelerated exit of low-margin sales activities.
Our consistent underlying sales growth remained strong, driven by new business wins using our sweetness and savory modulation tools to make our customers' end products healthier. We are excited about our future growth prospect.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman, our CFO."

I would like to put our financial performance into context since it is a direct result of the actions we've taken to improve the profitability of our portfolio, harness the growth of the emerging markets and create innovative and appealing new products that will help our customers to win new business and obtain market share growth.
Reported revenues for the third quarter totaled $709 million. Although sales decreased on a reported basis, on a local currency basis, they increased 5%.
The 600-basis-point foreign currency impact reflects the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies versus the year-ago quarter. 
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, our local currency sales growth was 7%, reflecting strong growth in both businesses, across geographies and categories. Approximately 70% of this growth was volume related with a balanced pricing. 
As you've heard from Hernan, Flavors continued their steady cadence of positive growth, which speaks to the consistency and stability of the Flavors business. This quarter, Flavors delivered 6% local currency growth. And excluding the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, they delivered growth of 9%.
Our Fragrance business delivered overall local currency sales growth of 5%, reflecting strong underlying trends in many areas of the business. Importantly, Fragrance Compounds delivered local currency sales growth of 9% and increased segment profitability, reflecting cost savings initiatives, improved category mix and the net impact of increased prices and lower increases in raw material costs.
Overall, our strategic priority of leveraging the growth in the emerging markets is producing favorable results. We're seeing continued double-digit local currency sales growth in the emerging markets, which has made significant contributions to the top line of both businesses, with a growing global middle class and the desire for, and availability of, products that consumers use in their everyday lives. We are very encouraged by the growth we are seeing and have made targeted investments in various areas of the globe in order to be able to continue to participate in this growth for the foreseeable future.
As we have mentioned in the past, we operate in a global environment that has seen varying degrees of economic momentum. Over the course of the year, we've spoken about slowing economic growth in Western Europe and China, and we've been closely monitoring our progress in both regions. This quarter, on a consolidated level, we saw improving trends in Western Europe driven by our Flavors business. But we continue to see some softness in Fragrances driven by Fragrance Ingredients. Both Flavors and Fragrances showed solid growth in China.
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with our underlying growth, which led to increased margin recovery and profitability. Our gross margins expanded to 350 basis points that has been alluded to previously, to 42.5%. The improvement was primarily due to an improved mix of business in both Flavors and Fragrances, increased volume from both businesses, the exit of lower-margin sales activities in Flavors and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. These gains, along with pricing actions, more than offset increased raw material costs. 
Research, selling and administrative costs increased 11% or $17 million this quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation accruals this quarter versus the year-ago quarter, when provisions were lower than target. In addition, we also had increased pension costs and investments behind growth initiatives. Importantly, our strong gross margin recovery more than offset these increased RSA expenses, resulting in a $6 million or 5% increase in adjusted operating profit to $134 million.
Interest expense declined $400,000 in the quarter, reflecting lower levels of outstanding debt. And other expenses decreased $3.4 million year-over-year due to gains associated with the company's deferred compensation plan assets.
As we've explained, this quarter, we took a $72.4 million charge, or $0.88 per share, to net income, arising from our Spanish tax settlement that we announced on August 2. Excluding the impact of this charge, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was 27.2% versus 26.9% in the year-ago quarter. The 30-basis-point increase primarily reflects the absence of an R&D tax credit in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2012. 
Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.08, up from $1 in the third quarter of 2011, excluding the reversal of a restructuring charge of $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter.
I would like to comment briefly on the top line trends we are seeing in our business. On a total company basis, our local currency sales growth has increased every quarter: from 1% in the first quarter to 4% in the second, to 5% this quarter. These trends are more pronounced if we exclude the impact of the exit of lower-margin sales activities, which has been putting incremental pressure on our top line growth. On a like-for-like basis, our growth increased from 1% and 5% in Q1 and Q2 to 7% in Q3. We assume the industry continues to grow at 2% to 3% overall. On a like-for-like basis, our year-to-date growth is 4%.
Looking at the business units, Flavors has shown consistent growth every quarter with 5% growth in the first quarter followed by 8% in the second and 6% in the third quarter. However, excluding the impact of the exit of low-margin business, the like-for-like sales growth has increased from 6% to 9% and 9% in the first 3 quarters of the year.  On a year-to-date basis, they have achieved 8% like-for-like growth.
Nicolas spoke of Fragrance Compounds' accelerating growth. The third quarter was a robust quarter for Fragrance Compounds, and growth has improved every quarter this year to 9% in the third quarter, resulting in a 5% growth year-to-date. All areas of the Compound business are showing continued momentum.  The only area that remains challenged is the external portion of our Fragrance Ingredients business. However, the strength of the rest of the portfolio is more than offsetting this weakness.
Overall, we are seeing better momentum in the business. While we are cautiously optimistic, trends are improving, and underlying volumes remain strong.
I'd like to provide you with an update of our raw material costs. Although they are still increasing, they are increasing at a lower rate, as we expected. Compared to the prior year quarter, raw material costs increased 2%. That said, the third quarter of last year was the highest increase of last year at 13%. So even though raw material costs only increased by 2% this quarter, on a 2-year basis, they are up 15%, which has continued to pressure our margins.
Year-over-year pricing benefits this quarter, while reduced versus previous quarters, have helped to somewhat reduce the margin pressure, while raw material costs remain as a significant headwind on a year-to-date basis.
Our continued margin recovery this quarter reflects strong innovations, improved product mix, cost savings initiatives and the exit of lower-margin sales activities in Flavors. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we have reached an inflection point in our gross margins, and we are seeing this play out.
From an overhead cost standpoint, RSA expense as a percent of sales increased 250 basis points this quarter to 23.6%, up from 21.1% of sales last year. The year-over-year change primarily reflects increased incentive compensation accruals in the third quarter of 2012 versus the third quarter of 2011. As you may recall, last year's RSA spend was favorably impacted by lower incentive compensation accruals due to the challenging economic environment. The level of incentive compensation we are now accruing for this year reflects our improved performance versus expectations and is more consistent with normalized levels of incentive compensation provisions. Other cost increases reflect continued R&D spend on innovation and on commercial activities and other customer-facing activities to support our growth in the emerging markets. Finally, we also incurred higher pension costs and increased our provision adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts.
The dollar remained stronger versus the euro in the third quarter versus a year ago. And as a result, foreign exchange, as we have discussed, had an approximate 600-basis-point impact on the top line. However, there was limited impact on the third quarter year-over-year operating profit margin, largely due to our cash flow hedging activities. These activities, combined with our other operating improvements, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Looking ahead to the balance of the year, over 70% of our euro-dollar exposure in 2012 remains hedged at the rate near $1.39. With current rates at around $1.28, the euro had strengthened versus where it was in the third quarter. We therefore expect that any headwinds from foreign exchange in the fourth quarter will be negligible. For 2013, we are nearly 70% hedged against the euro at levels that approximate $1.29.
From a cash flow perspective, for the first 9 months of the year, cash flows from operations were $143 million, or 6.7% of sales, compared with $117 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Importantly, the cash flow in 2012 includes a cash payment of $105.5 million this quarter related to the Spanish tax settlement and a $240 million -- $248 million cash inflow from ongoing operations.
This increased cash flow from ongoing operations in 2012 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year incentive compensation and income tax payments in 2012 versus 2011, as well as an improved earnings position.
As anticipated, capital expenditures are increasing, in line with our guidance, due to the investments we've made in Singapore and China. And we expect capital spending to approach 5% of sales for the full year 2012. The Singapore plant, which opened in early September, manufactures both Flavors and Fragrances liquid compounds. The Guangzhou, China plant will open early next year and will be exclusively Flavors focused. 
And as noted by Hernan, in addition, last month, we announced a $50 million-plus investment in expanding Flavors' manufacturing facility and building a creative center in Gebze, Turkey. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Doug for his perspective on the balance of the year."

We are pleased with the progress we've made over the past few quarters. The diverse and stable nature of our business, combined with our customer intimacy and consumer insights, enabled us to deliver strong results in a challenged environment.
Although we are mindful of economic volatility in various parts of the world, we are confident that, based on our diversification, we will be able to offset softness in one part of our business with strengths in another part of the business world.
The accelerated momentum we see in the Flavor and Fragrance Compounds business is fueled by the strategic investments we have made in the emerging markets over many years, combined with our ability to provide customers with products that meet and surpass consumer expectation and lead to market share growth for both our customers and for us.
We are committed to driving the business for the long term and executing on our growth plans. 
IFF's operations were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, resulting in short-term disruptions in power, manufacturing and in our information technology systems. I am pleased to say that most of these disruptions have now been resolved due to the rapid reaction of our employees in implementing our disaster recovery plans. We are currently in the process of estimating the impact of the storm on our business. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our fourth quarter financial results.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued strong local currency sales growth in Flavors, offset in part by the continued acceleration and exit of low-margin sales activities. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to continue in Fine & Beauty Care, while also maintaining solid growth in Functional. We expect to see improving volume trends in Ingredients business in the fourth quarter, although we still expect year-over-year moderate volume declines.
With regard to margin trends, we expect that raw material costs will continue to stabilize at the current rates, which, as Kevin has pointed out, when combined with last year's trends still results in historically high levels of input costs. Given our progress on a number of initiatives, we expect our gross margins will continue to trend above year-ago levels.
We have a committed and dedicated group of people whose mission is to see the company succeed. We are pushing ahead to meet our internal profit objectives despite the headwinds mentioned. Excluding the costs related to the impact of the hurricane, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in line with current market consensus for the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, our strong performance at IFF this quarter is a result of our geographic footprint, our product diversity and our ability to work with our customers year in and year out to develop new products that help shape the industry and delight consumers.
Going forward, we expect continued momentum and growth. We will continue to proactively manage our performance and calibrate costs in line with our top line growth as we continue to execute against our business plans.
With that, we would be happy to take any questions you may have. Thank you for your participation."

The recent Turkey announcement is supporting other parts of the emerging market portfolio that we have. But clearly, they're about increasing our capacities. There are efficiencies embedded into those plants. But at the same token, there will be some incremental depreciation that we have at this particular point in time as well. Having said all of that, we will continue to try and drive incremental efficiencies into our business.

Let me take a stab and then I'll turn it over to any my colleagues who want to add any additional color. I think that again, as outlined in the prepared comments and some earlier comments, there was a wide swath of things that were driving our gross margin. While certainly, pricing helped to offset the incremental input costs that we talked about, it really wasn't the primary driver. The net pricing versus input costs was not the driver to our margins. Volume and mix certainly was a key determinant of that, and that certainly helped provide a big chunk of the benefits. And I think also, the cost savings initiatives were also important, and that is just the blocking and tackling of running the business where we saw some good progress again in Fragrance, where they were able to reduce some costs in their business. Hernan and their team, obviously, have been managing through the exit of some of the lower margin, and that benefit approached 50 basis points for the company as well. So there certainly was a wide range of issues that were executed, or opportunities that were executed against, which allowed us to deliver the strong margin profile. So it just wasn't about the pricing even though that continued to be an important element to help reduce some of the pressure from input costs."

As we all know, one of the most critical seasons for our customers is the one in which we're entering right now until Christmas. So I believe that the Christmas season will be driving a lot of the market trends. And from that, we will be able to project our performance. So I think it's too early in the season. What is important is that where we participate, we have a strong momentum, and we've been able to secure and to win significant new launches."

And while we haven't disclosed the number, I'll take you through the 3 planks that we had then and we have now. And it's been an interesting evolution. That maximization of the portfolio is both -- that's really where the concept flowed from. It was to really focus as much on growing where we could. And you can see in both the Fine discussion Nicolas has had and some of the categories that Hernan discussed, we've got some priority categories, and they're broadly doing well and contributing to that goal. The third plank was that if we couldn't fix things, we would exit businesses. And that was -- there was a little bit of that in Fragrances in previous quarters. The focus really for the company in the last few quarters has been on Flavors. And Hernan touched upon that, and Kevin has just mentioned the benefit of margin we get from exiting. Exiting was a last resort. But nevertheless, you can see the company's positive traction in margin recovery from having exited the business and still having some good top line growth. The second plank, and really the most interesting one and where we've candidly been treading water, and while that's disappointing in the absolute, I think the particulars around the facts are important. But treading water was really around some categories in Functional Fragrance in the Fragrance businesses. And the treading water was the identification of the need to fix some businesses. And candidly, the team have really taken some excellent actions to move the progress ahead, but we have been hit by significant raw material cost increases over the last couple of years. So it's a function of taking some pricing with customers, revising some formulas, doing some things we inside the company call ""some value creation,"" which is streamlining the business. We've done a number of things, all of which have been positive in terms of margin recovery, but they've been offset by the, if you will, the tsunami of the raw material cost increases in the last couple of years. So since that meeting, we've probably made very little traction despite some really strong actions. But if this grow-the-categories, we're still doing that, we will exit some low margin. But that fixed Functional, we've made some -- little progress. We've still got more to do, but it's been a great experience. And had we not, frankly, been able to engender some of the successes I just talked about in the light of the cost increases, the margin would have been extremely negative."
