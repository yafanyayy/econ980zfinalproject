Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011",1086,"Great, thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011 net of acquisitions, were Performance Chemicals and Agriculture. Sales in developing markets were up 27% and that represents 34% of company sales.
Market-driven science is critical to our success, and we expect to have about 30% of 2011 sales come from products that were introduced in the past 4 years. And we'll be finalizing that data in February.
Fixed cost and working capital productivity surpassed the targets we set for the year. Fixed cost productivity exceeded our target by $100 million and working capital productivity beat the target by $200 million. Variable cost productivity programs, they also delivered comparable results. 
DuPont delivered a record $3.93 per share in 2011 on an underlying basis, which is up 20% versus 2010, capping off a very strong year with broad-based contributions. We ended the year with $3.3 billion in free cash flow compared to $3.1 billion last year, an improvement of 8%.
During the fourth quarter, we faced several headwinds. When we updated our full year guidance on December 9, we pointed to market softness in electronics and customers' conservative year end cash management with further destocking in polymer and industrial supply chain. We have also made clear that the photovoltaic inventory correction continued through the quarter. These factors combined to press volume down 10%. Despite these difficult conditions underlying earnings were up in the fourth quarter when adjusted for the differences in tax rate year-over-year. Our earnings performance demonstrates an ability to execute extremely well in volatile and uncertain markets. It is our view that fourth quarter volume performance was strongly impacted by cash conservation and supply chain actions and did not reflect broad macro conditions. 
There was GDP growth in the quarter in most regions, with growth also projected for 2012. The good news is that caution in the fourth quarter means that many supply chain inventories are fixed. We expect some conservatism to linger in the first quarter with a rebound effect likely to come in the second quarter, and I'll provide a more detailed perspective on how easy the rebound effect playing out later in the call.
To further illustrate my point that fourth quarter volume was primarily a function of cash conservation and supply chain restocking rather than macro conditions, I'll share fourth quarter perspectives on key markets. Let's start with Electronics, where continued destocking in PV was expected. As the channel corrects for significant overproduction in the first half of 2011, we expect destocking to be completed by midyear, perhaps sooner, with PV installations to be up about 10% in 2012. Remember, PV sales represent about 40% of the Electronic segment.  For Consumer Electronics, the seasonal decline in orders was more than expected, in part due to delays in launch timing for next generation smartphones and tablet PCs, coupled with some destocking in caution in the value chain through the quarter.  Auto builds were essentially flat, with gains in the U.S. and Japan, offset by declines in every other region. Our Performance Material segment was affected by destocking in their supplying chain, most notably in Europe and Asia-Pacific. As expected, the titanium dioxide market experience a pause, with volumes down and prices up year-over-year. For added perspective, our full year TiO2 volume was down modestly in 2011, first as a sold-out position in 2010 and expectations for volume growth in 2012. TiO2 demands on average tends to follow GDP, and with no major tranches of new capacity coming on in the next 24 months, we expect this market to remain strong, with solid fundamentals and healthy returns.
And speaking of strong market fundamental, our Ag businesses continue to deliver impressive results. Fourth quarter sales were up 8% on 3% volume growth. However, the real story is the Latin American summer season, which primarily spans our third and fourth quarters. So for the second half, the Ag segment sales were up 23% and underlying PTOI was up 43%. These outstanding results reflect a constant press of product lineup in Latin America, with industry-leading germplasm, coupled with more than 85% insect rate penetration in Brazil corn.  Our right products, right acre approach is delivering strong sales share gains and most importantly, delighted customers. 
Pulling this all together, we dealt with a wide range of market conditions at year-end. We remained close to our customers, often taking advantage of market positives to accelerate new product valuations. 
So I'd like to highlight a few innovation achievements as we closed out the year. In the fourth quarter, we announced a licensing agreement with a major Asian manufacturer for OLED technology. This acknowledges that we have achieved a major milestone in demonstrating technology that enables large displays to be produced at significantly lower cost than competing technologies. And we're quickly moving into small-scale semi-works production where we would develop basic data and supply materials for proved out by interested partners.
Rynaxypyr insecticide sales reached $580 million this year, with a strong finish in Latin America and Asia. For context, this means this product line represents about 20% of total sales in our Crop Protection business. We look forward to the launching of the next product in this family, Cyzypyr, in the later part of 2012. 
We receive regulatory approval at summer for the next wave of integrated and reduced refuge products, Optimum AcreMax and Optimum AcreMax XTRA, which will deliver significant value this year for our customers. And we look forward to the regulatory approval of AcreMax Extreme in the first half of 2012. 
And last month, the Society of Plastics Engineers announced their award for Most Innovative Use of Plastic. And DuPont products were featured at 3 separate awards for Ford, Fiat and Toyota. Two of the innovative components featured renewably sourced material, including our bio based Surlyn polymer in the carpeting application. 
Finally, for the 2011 year, DuPont was granted a total of 910 U.S. patents, the highest number for a single year in the company's history, and I'm extremely proud of our scientists who developed this proprietary innovations and of our marketers whose understanding of customers' unmet needs shape these research and development programs. 
So now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for a detailed review of the financial results of the quarter, and then I'll share my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"
268053,118466582,209755,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. In spite of volatile market conditions, DuPont delivered a record year in 2011, with underlying earnings of $3.93 per share, which as Ellen already mentioned, was a 20% improvement over 2010. Our exceptional p",1795,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. In spite of volatile market conditions, DuPont delivered a record year in 2011, with underlying earnings of $3.93 per share, which as Ellen already mentioned, was a 20% improvement over 2010. Our exceptional performance continues to demonstrate our ability to successfully focus on innovation, productivity and differential management. Ellen's already given you a sense of the dynamic market conditions that we face during the fourth quarter, so I'll go straight to the financial details of the quarter, which played out as expected and consistent with our updated guidance in December. 
Let's start with Slide 4, which is a summary of earnings and sales results. Fourth quarter total segment PTOI increased $100 million or 16%. Earnings per share were $0.35 on an underlying basis compared to $0.50 in the prior year. The decrease here was due to the significantly higher tax rate, which was a negative $0.23 per share impact year-over-year. 
Consolidated net sales of $8.4 billion were up 14% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 14%, with double-digit increases in all regions reflecting our continued strong discipline of pricing for value. The Danisco acquisition was the primary driver for the 10% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was down 10%, primarily reflecting supply chain destocking that Ellen has already covered.
Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the fourth quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 5. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.43 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to successfully implement price increases, pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver.  On a full year basis, this spread was a positive $1.41 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 15% versus last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw an increase of 13% over 2010 and this includes about 3 percentage points for metals, which, as you know, is passed through. As we indicated in December, we expect an increase of about 4% for the full year 2012.
Volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.20 per share. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. The decline in volume reflects decreases in all regions and all segments, except for Agriculture, reflecting the market environment that Ellen has previously discussed. On a full year basis, total company volume was up 1%, with Ag volume up 10%.
Continuing with our variance analysis, let's now move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.17 per share, and this is primarily driven by actions in the fourth quarter to support growth, such as increase investments in Ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 capacity expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity that some of our existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration of the marketplace.
On a full year basis, fixed costs were 40% of sales versus 42% last year, well on our way to meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrent with the actions to support growth, we delivered more than $400 million of fixed cost savings in 2011. As we told you during Investor Day last month, we expect to deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2012.  Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter and $0.17 on a full year basis.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates and cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is shown on Schedule D in the earnings news release to depict the exact number our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Income tax on the EPS waterfall is a $0.23 headwind. This represents a difference between the base tax rate this quarter, which was 27.5%, versus a negative 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year tax rate of 22% was higher than our expected full year tax rate of 21%, reflecting an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. This impact was recognized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a higher 27.5% rate. Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the full year tax rate was lower than expected because of 100% of the U.S. R&D tax credit which was recorded in the quarter and that resulted in a negative 14.9% rate.  The full year 2011 impact of the 22% tax rate versus our previous guidance of 21% is about a $0.05 per share headwind. 
Next on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. This includes earnings, additional interest and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that were not included in our one-time items. On a full year reported basis, Danisco diluted earnings by $0.13 a share. This includes underlying results of $0.09, offset by significant items associated with the transaction and cost to achieve synergies of $0.22 per share. As we discussed during Investor Day, we are committed to achieving at least $130 million of cost synergies in 2012, which is a full year ahead of original expectation.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 6. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 14% in the quarter and 27% for the full year. 
Turning now to balance sheet and cash on Slide 7, we ended the year with $3.3 billion of free cash flow versus the prior year of $3.1 billion. This outstanding performance is the result of strong sales and earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity.  At the end of 2011, on a 12-month trailing basis versus the end of 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 7% excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and delivering $500 million of productivity this year.  Combining this with a more than $700 million of productivity in 2010, we have already surpassed our commitment to deliver $1 billion of working capital productivity between 2010 and 2012. And I'll reaffirm our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2012. 
We ended 2011 with a net debt of $8.5 billion, which is approximately $5 billion more than our position in December of 2010. This increase reflects $7 billion acquisition of Danisco, partially offset by exceptional free cash flow performance for the year. 
I want to give a quick update on our pension contributions. Last week, we made the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan we have communicated to you on Investor Day. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A, AA credit rating, and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. During 2011, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend.  Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In summary for the fourth quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one, with agricultural and food markets continuing to be strong while we experienced destocking in several supply chains. In spite of these market conditions, we were able to deliver a double-digit increase in total segment underlying PTOI, which is a testament to our pricing discipline and productivity focus.
Turning now to 2012, we are reaffirming the guidance we gave at Investor Day of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, an increase of 7% to 12% from 2011. However, I'd like to provide you with an update on 2 of our financial assumptions, currency and the tax rate, that were a part of our guidance on Investor Day.  Currency rates remain volatile, and at current rates, we expect the U.S. dollar to be about 6% stronger in 2012 versus our previous assumptions of 3%. The 6% stronger dollar translates to about a $0.25 per share headwind on a year-over-year basis or an additional $0.12 per share headwind versus our previous assumptions. For the first quarter, the stronger dollar is about $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Turning to tax rate, we said in 2012 that the planned rate will be about 22%. We communicated this during Investor Day. We now expect the full year tax rate to be about 23%, which is a $0.05 per share headwind versus the previous guidance, reflecting unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions.
From a market perspective, our assumptions are essentially in line with what we shared with you during Investor Day. We expect to see some of the softness from the fourth quarter continuing in the first quarter, with the industrial markets rebounding further into 2012. For PV, we expect inventories to correct in the second quarter of 2012, followed by a rebound in manufacturing with growth and installations of about 10% for the full year. 
Consumer electronics, we'll see weak demand early in the year, with market recovery later in the year driven by smartphones and tablets, with good year-over-year growth in 2012. 
In TiO2, Agriculture and Food, the fundamentals remain strong.
While acknowledging that the 2 updated financial assumptions do create downward pressure on the 2012 guidance, it's still very early in the year. Macro conditions remain volatile, including currency, and much could change between now and the end of this year. To combat these challenges, we remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. The businesses are staying close to the customers to better understand demand signals. We know what levers to pull to meet our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership teams remain confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are reaffirming our previous 2012 guidance.
In summary, we had a record year in 2011 in terms of underlying earnings per share. You can once again see the strength of the result that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio to its more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, you can expect us to continue to deliver superior results.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"
268053,118466582,209755,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. We'll start with our segment reviews with Agriculture on Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 8%, with volume gains of 3% and price gains of 5%. The seasonal PTOI loss of $160 million was lower than previous year losses du",1987,"Thanks, Nick. We'll start with our segment reviews with Agriculture on Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 8%, with volume gains of 3% and price gains of 5%. The seasonal PTOI loss of $160 million was lower than previous year losses due to increased sales. Fourth quarter does not reflect the majority of any single season since much of the impact of Latin America summer season is captured in our third quarter results. Most of Brazil's different season is captured in our first quarter results and most of northern hemisphere sales are captured in our first and second quarter results. 
Our full year performance clearly shows the power of the businesses. Our teams delivered 17% sales growth with 10% volume gains, 6% higher price and 1% impact from portfolio. 3% earnings growth, coupled with industry-leading sales performance, translated into 19% PTOI margins for the segment. The combination of our global infrastructure and the business ability to respond and win in every major market with an intense focus on the customer demonstrate the power of our business model. This discipline of service and momentum of innovation are the foundation for growth in 2012 and beyond. 
Taking a closer look within the segment, Seed fourth quarter sale of $621 million increased 7% based on the close of an exceptional Latin America summer season. Latin America sales in the second half were up more than 40%, driven by over 55% growth in Brazil's summer corn sales excluding currency. As our L.A. teams mobilized quickly and responded well to the increase in corn hectares. The quarter also captured improved sales in the Philippines and Indonesia, reflecting improved weather conditions and increased planting acres, with our teams capturing more than their share of that increase. 
For the full year 2011, the Pioneer global team delivered another year of market wins, with growing sales, earnings and margin. The incremental contribution was well-balanced between North America and international growth as we predicted coming into 2011. Success was underpinned by new product penetration, increased acreage and share gains in North America, volume growth and value capture in Latin America and success growing in Europe and Asia. Specifically, 2011 Seed sales were up 17% to $6.3 billion, reflecting both volume and price contributions. 
In summary, the business delivered on all commitments, including its focus on investing for future growth ending an outstanding year with the business stronger than ever. And importantly, here's an update on North America. The sales teams have been setting a historic pace as we work closely with customers during a very dynamic cycle. Our order book is ahead of last year, with our volumes tracking in line with growth objectives and the value proposition aligned with customer expectations. At the product level, our newest integrated and reduced refuge product offerings are being embraced and confidence in our soybean performance and disease packages are strong. Specifically, we anticipate about 60% of our triples will be converted to AcreMax 1 or AcreMax XTRA. In addition, we're releasing many new hybrids with our AQUAmax technology. 
In soybeans, we have over 30 new varieties and about 60 new products from the last 2 years penetrating our lineup. And 1 final comment as we look forward to 2012, we anticipate AcreMax Extreme regulatory approval in the first half and will be testing this product this season, allowing thousands of farmers to see it in their local fields.
Turning to Crop Protection products, sales for the quarter of $676 million grew 9%, reflecting growth across all major product lines in most regions, with the largest contribution for the quarter coming from strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America. All regions achieved double-digit sales growth in the second half, led by the excellent performance in the Latin American market.  Importantly, these strong results reflect volume growth and net price gains. 
For the full year 2011, Crop Protection sales of $2.9 billion grew 16%, including a 3% decline from divested businesses. Our volume increases led by Rynaxypyr insecticide, which posted sales of about $580 million, growing over 45% in its fourth season with continued market share gains.
Our 2011 successes are many, including an insect control portfolio exceeding $1 billion in sales, continued growth of decosystrobe and fungicide and introduction of new proprietary herbicide blends for expanded lead control options for our customers. We continue to refresh and renew our Crop Protection portfolio by divesting older chemistries while accelerating our R&D pipeline advancements and new product launches. 
This team continues to execute well with their strategy, which centers on market-driven innovation and game-changing new products. Looking ahead to the first half of 2012 for the Agriculture segment, we expect to increase sales moderately, with mid-single-digit earnings growth. Our assumptions center on strong operating performance in the businesses, delivering both volume growth and pricing gains, offset in part by the transient impacts of input cost increases continued growth investments, and most notably, significant currency headwinds. The split between quarters hinges on the northern hemisphere season, favoring March or April, and currently, that's hard to call. We assume growth investments, and more importantly, currency headwind, will be more heavily weighted to the first quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Electronics and Communications segment. Sales of $630 million declined 18% compared to the same period last year, with 33% lower volume offset by 15% higher prices essentially, metals pass through. Pre-tax earnings of $42 million or $56 million lower than the same period last year due to inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in consumer electronics and plasma displays. Also included in this quarter's earnings is $20 million of licensing income from our partner in the development of advance OLEDs.
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter, due to an excess of inventory in the supply chain. We believe these excess inventory levels will continue through the first half of 2012. We expect PV installations to grow at 10% this year, with a rebound in demand during the second half of the year. 
For first quarter, E&C sales and earnings are expected to be substantially lower than prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and softness in consumer electronics and strong first quarter comps. Excluding the fourth quarter licensing income, we expect segment PTOI to be up sequentially. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $289 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's Enzyme business and DuPont's Commercial Biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed, with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including $6 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. For the first quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be in line with fourth quarter results. We continue to see good growth across these product lines, and anticipate PTOI margin expansion for the full year.
Moving to Slide 11 in our Nutrition & Health segment, sales of $806 million grew 138%, with the acquisition impact from the Danisco Specialty Food Ingredients business. Earnings of $52 million reflected sales more than offsetting integration costs, and includes $20 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. Incilla specialty soy products increased volume and price with the continued penetration into health-related product. Sales growth in specialty was offset by lower soy crushed seed sales, in line with the business objective the shift makes the higher value offering. Earnings growth reflected a positive  mix shift and productivity improvement.
The acquired businesses of health and protection and enablers grew on a pro forma basis about 4%, as pricing gains were offset in part by lower volumes due to destocking.
Moving to the outlook, the segment is on track for the full benefit of planned cost synergies to positively contribute to 2012 performance. The benefit will mount throughout the year, reflecting the implementation schedule. Specifically, for the first quarter, we expect sales of the combined segment in the range of $800 million to $850 million, with portfolio impact, as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth on higher sales and cost synergies, coupled with the sales improvements, will reflect sequential improvement in margins, in the range of mid to high single digits inclusive of amortization.
Now on Slide 12, Performance Chemicals, sales of $1.9 billion increased 12% primarily due to higher selling prices. Both businesses in this segment; demonstrated double-digit sales increases overall, with the most strength from North America. As we shared last quarter, TiO2 markets paused with fiscal tightening in China and Eurozone concerns, leading to substantial short-term demand decline and destocking in the value chains. Even with this expected softness, the segment delivered PTOI of $433 million, a 37% increase versus last year, due to enhanced pricing in TiO2 and fluoropolymers and continued emphasis on fixed cost productivity.
For 2012, we expect global demand growth and see signs of strengthening first in North American markets. Leading indicators point to an improving TiO2 outlook, with North American order patterns consistent with recovery to a more typical seasonal demand profile across 2 quarters.
Additionally, fluoropolymers demand remains strong. As a result, first quarter sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI up substantially. With 8 decades experience in this industry, our confidence in TiO2 demand fundamentals remains intact, and we are proceeding with the TiO2 capacity expansion as announced.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 8% on 10% stronger pricing offsetting 2% lower volume. The segment had price increases in all of its major market segments to offset the higher cost of raw materials. Auto builds were flat to down in all regions, except North America, where builds were up 17%. And there was strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. 
PTOI of $58 million decreased $13 million, primarily due to mix impact and a $7 million settlement. For the first quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year, with earnings up significantly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 2% in the first quarter, with full year builds expected to be up about 4% globally. This segment is driving actions in all product lines to offset higher raw material costs, with continued productivity to improve margin.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14, sales were up 1% based on 14% selling price increase, offsetting a destocking lead drop in volume. While underlying automotive markets were growing, value chain destocking was most evident in Europe and appeared to finish in North America. Electronics was soft while packaging markets were stable. 
Absent the one-time $31 million benefit last year, PTOI was down $24 million or about 14% on lower volume. For the first quarter, we expect sales down modestly as price increases essentially mitigate softer volume and PTOI down substantially on volumes, driven mostly by a weaker Europe and conservative channel inventory management. Global auto builds are expected to grow at 2% and packaging demand to remain stable. 
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 10% on a combination of pricing and portfolio change, partially offset by 2% lower volume. Sales grew in all regions, led by Asia Pacific at 22%. PTOI was $94 million, essentially flat versus last year as portfolio change and selling price offset softer volumes and higher raw material costs. Additionally, the prior year included a net charge of $11 million for one-time items.
For the first quarter, market fundamentals remain noisy for our advanced material offerings, with some improvement in North American demand and continued growth in Latin America. We see improvement in law enforcement and fiberoptic cable market, as our Kevlar XP and Kevlar AP continue to be well-received in the market. Our consulting and CleanTech offerings continue to see moderate demand up globally. Overall, sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI down moderately. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

After a challenging fourth quarter, we anticipate conditions will improve in many of our industrial businesses as the year plays out. 
Our growth outlook varies by region and by business. We see Asia demand recovering from the slowdown we saw on the fourth quarter. We continue to expect slow, sequential recovery in the U.S. and weak demand in many European markets. We're poised for a very strong year ahead in agriculture, our order books for seeds is at a historic pace ahead of last year and consistent with our expectations for strong underlying growth. In Crop Protection, product expansions will contribute to 2012 results. 
We have important milestones. With the initial launch of Cyzypyr in the second half, which over time, when coupled with Rynaxypyr, we expect to hit $1 billion in sales. With respect to TiO2, we expect markets to tighten by midyear, with the North American economy supporting a coating season comparable to last year, along with restocking of a value chain in Asia. For the full year, we expect TiO2 sales volume to meet or exceed 2011 levels. 
Our expectation for company volume in the first quarter are cautious. We expect volumes for many of our industrial businesses to be up sequentially versus the fourth quarter, but down year-over-year against strong comps in the first quarter of 2011.  At this point, many of our supply chain inventories are low, and we expect demand to pick up slowly, starting late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. 
One exception where destocking continues in the first quarter is photovoltaics. We're seeing positive signs that production will pick up again by midyear and expecting PV installations to grow about 10% this year. 
At today's exchange rate, currency will be a headwind for our businesses, and Nick mentioned this. We have the entire year ahead of us to manage contingency to compensate. 
We'll continue to be discipline in our execution, whether to the advancement of one of our R&D pipelines, a customer collaboration at 1 of our innovation centers or a productivity initiative. We are well-positioned for recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint. And we look ahead with confidence in our ability to execute well and deliver growth in 2012. 
Karen, back to you."

When you think about what's going on from the patent side, Japan comes off in December, came off December in 2011. And that's nearly half of the Pharma impact that we saw this year. So you can see the reason for the decline going down to 50 is because of Japan that came off in December and Canada's going to be coming off this month. So between the 2 of those, that's the primary reason for going down to the $50 million we anticipate in '12."

I would suggest that it's a good business at the depth of it and it's a fantastic business at the peak. And over the cycle, we get very strong segment returns for this business. And that's driven by our competitive advantage from our manufacturing process technology. And as you see, it isn't just to break cash generator for us. So when you have a peer -- cyclical commodity and at the depths of the cycle, you're still making a great return for the company, it is worthy of investment. And so, that's where it hits. The other thing is we haven't put a new line, a major line into that business. The last 1 that opened up was in Guanien in Taiwan, and that was 1994, maybe. And so, it's been a while and from that standpoint. On PV, we've seen obviously the metal pass through. If you take that away, it's all about the efficiency of the sell and what that delivers. We were seeing PV module prices come down as commensurate with the increases in efficiency in the modules themselves. And that's when you saw some of the support from some of the governments kind of go away. The economics largely remain the same. The margins are holding. And I do believe it's because things like Army Solamet paste, which offers higher efficiency, enables that equation to work."

On a dilution basis, on an EPS basis number of shares, I think the work we've been doing in that area is pretty evident in the fourth quarter. We bought back $0.25 million first quarter of '11, we bought back another $0.25 million in the third quarter, another quarter. So if you look over a period of time there, we brought we bought back close to $1 billion of shares, which is looking to control the dilution if over that 18-month period.

If you look at auto builds in 2012, they're going to have a slow start to the year probably down in the first quarter, but all in all, auto builds for the year in China are going to be up 7%.

Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011,",1086,"Great. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011, net of acquisitions, were Performance Chemicals and Agriculture. Sales in developing markets were up 27%, and that represents 34% of company sales.
Market-driven science is critical to our success, and we expect to have about 30% of 2011 sales come from products that were introduced in the past 4 years, and we'll be finalizing that data in February.
Fixed cost and working capital productivity surpassed the targets we set for the year. Fixed cost productivity exceeded our target by $100 million, and working capital productivity beat the target by $200 million. Variable cost productivity programs, they also delivered comparable results. 
DuPont delivered a record $3.93 per share in 2011 on an underlying basis, which is up 20% versus 2010, capping off a very strong year with broad-based contributions. We ended the year with $3.3 billion in free cash flow compared to $3.1 billion last year, an improvement of 8%.
During the fourth quarter, we faced several headwinds. When we updated our full year guidance on December 9, we pointed to market softness in electronics and customers' conservative year end cash management with further destocking in polymer and industrial supply chain. We have also made clear that the photovoltaic inventory correction continued through the quarter. These factors combined to press volume down 10%. Despite these difficult conditions, underlying earnings were up in the fourth quarter when adjusted for the differences in tax rate year-over-year. Our earnings performance demonstrates an ability to execute extremely well in volatile and uncertain markets. It is our view that fourth quarter volume performance was strongly impacted by cash conservation and supply chain actions and did not reflect broad macro conditions. 
There was GDP growth in the quarter in most regions, with growth also projected for 2012. The good news is that caution in the fourth quarter means that many supply chain inventories are fixed. We expect some conservatism to linger in the first quarter, with a rebound effect likely to come in the second quarter, and I'll provide a more detailed perspective on how we see the rebound effect playing out later on this call.
To further illustrate my point that fourth quarter volume was primarily a function of cash conservation and supply chain restocking rather than macro conditions, I'll share fourth quarter perspectives on key markets. Let's start with electronics, where continued destocking in PV was expected. As the channel corrects for significant overproduction in the first half of 2011, we expect destocking to be completed by midyear, perhaps sooner, with PV installations to be up about 10% in 2012. Remember, PV sales represent about 40% of the electronics segment. For consumer electronics, the seasonal decline in orders was more than expected, in part due to delays in launch timing for next generation smartphones and tablet PCs, coupled with some destocking and caution in the value chain through the quarter. Auto builds were essentially flat, with gains in the U.S. and Japan offset by declines in every other region. Our Performance Materials segment was affected by destocking in their supplying chain, most notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. As expected, the titanium dioxide market experienced a pause, with volumes down and prices up year-over-year. For added perspective, our full year TiO2 volume was down modestly in 2011 versus a sold-out position in 2010 and expectations for volume growth in 2012. TiO2 demand, on average, tends to follow GDP, and with no major tranches of new capacity coming on in the next 24 months, we expect this market to remain strong, with solid fundamentals and healthy returns.
And speaking of strong market fundamental, our ag businesses continue to deliver impressive results. Fourth quarter sales were up 8% on 3% volume growth. However, the real story is the Latin American summer season, which primarily spans our third and fourth quarters. So for the second half, the ag segment sales were up 23%, and underlying PTOI was up 43%. These outstanding results reflect a constant press of product lineup in Latin America, with industry-leading germplasm, coupled with more than 85% insect rate penetration in Brazil corn.  Our Right Product, Right Acre approach is delivering strong sales, share gains and, most importantly, delighted customers. 
Pulling this all together, we dealt with a wide range of market conditions at year-end. We remain close to our customers, often taking advantage of market positives to accelerate new product valuations. 
So I'd like to highlight a few innovation achievements as we closed out the year. In the fourth quarter, we announced a licensing agreement with a major Asian manufacturer for OLED technology. This acknowledges that we have achieved a major milestone in demonstrating technology that enables large displays to be produced at significantly lower cost than competing technologies. And we're quickly moving into small-scale semi-works production where we would develop basic data and supply materials for prove out by interested partners.
Rynaxypyr insecticide sales reached $580 million this year, with a strong finish in Latin America and Asia. For context, this means this product line represents about 20% of total sales in our crop protection business. We look forward to the launching of the next product in this family, Cyazypyr, in the later part of 2012. 
We received regulatory approval at summer for the next wave of integrated and reduced refuge products, Optimum AcreMax and Optimum AcreMax XTRA, which will deliver significant value this year for our customers. And we look forward to the regulatory approval of AcreMax Extreme in the first half of 2012. 
And last month, the Society of Plastics Engineers announced their award for Most Innovative Use of Plastic, and DuPont products were featured at 3 separate awards for Ford, Fiat and Toyota. Two of the innovative components featured renewably sourced material, including our bio-based Sorona polymer in the carpeting application. 
Finally, for the 2011 year, DuPont was granted a total of 910 U.S. patents, the highest number for a single year in the company's history, and I'm extremely proud of our scientists who developed these proprietary innovations and of our marketers whose understanding of customers' unmet needs shaped these research and development programs. 
So now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for a detailed review of the financial results of the quarter, and then I'll share my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"

Our exceptional",1794,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. In spite of volatile market conditions, DuPont delivered a record year in 2011, with underlying earnings of $3.93 per share, which, as Ellen already mentioned, was a 20% improvement over 2010. Our exceptional performance continues to demonstrate our ability to successfully focus on innovation, productivity and differential management. Ellen's already given you a sense of the dynamic market conditions that we faced during the fourth quarter, so I'll go straight to the financial details of the quarter, which played out as expected and consistent with our updated guidance in December. 
Let's start with Slide 4, which is a summary of earnings and sales results. Fourth quarter total segment PTOI increased over $100 million or 16%. Earnings per share were $0.35 on an underlying basis compared to $0.50 in the prior year. The decrease here was due to the significantly higher tax rate, which was a negative $0.23 per share impact year-over-year. 
Consolidated net sales of $8.4 billion were up 14% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 14%, with double-digit increases in all regions, reflecting our continued strong discipline of pricing for value. The Danisco acquisition was the primary driver for the 10% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was down 10%, primarily reflecting supply chain destocking that Ellen has already covered.
Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the fourth quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 5. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.43 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to successfully implement price increases, pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver. On a full year basis, this spread was a positive $1.41 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 15% versus last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw an increase of 13% over 2010, and this includes about 3 percentage points for metals, which, as you know, is passed through. As we indicated in December, we expect an increase of about 4% for the full year 2012.
Volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.20 per share. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. The decline in volume reflects decreases in all regions and all segments, except for Agriculture, reflecting the market environment that Ellen has previously discussed. On a full year basis, total company volume was up 1%, with ag volume up 10%.
Continuing with our variance analysis, let's now move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.17 per share, and this was primarily driven by actions in the fourth quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 capacity expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at some of our existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration of the marketplace.
On a full year basis, fixed costs were 40% of sales versus 42% last year, well on our way to meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrent with the actions to support growth, we delivered more than $400 million of fixed cost savings in 2011. As we told you during Investor Day last month, we expect to deliver another $300 million of fixed-cost productivity in 2012.  Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter and $0.17 on a full year basis.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates and cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is shown on Schedule D in the earnings news release to depict the exact number our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Income tax on the EPS waterfall is a $0.23 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter, which was 27.5%, versus a negative 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year tax rate of 22% was higher than our expected full year tax rate of 21%, reflecting an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. This impact was recognized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a higher 27.5% rate. Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the full year tax rate was lower than expected because of 100% of the U.S. R&D tax credit which was recorded in the quarter, and it resulted in a negative 14.9% rate.  The full year 2011 impact of the 22% tax rate versus our previous guidance of 21% is about a $0.05 per share headwind. 
Next on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. This includes earnings, additional interest and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that were not included in our one-time items. On a full year reported basis, Danisco diluted earnings by $0.13 a share. This includes underlying results of $0.09, offset by significant items associated with the transaction and cost to achieve synergies of $0.22 per share. As we discussed during Investor Day, we are committed to achieving at least $130 million of cost synergies in 2012, which is a full year ahead of original expectation.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 6. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 14% in the quarter and 27% for the full year. 
Turning now to balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. We ended the year with $3.3 billion of free cash flow versus the prior year of $3.1 billion. This outstanding performance is the result of strong sales and earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity.  At the end of 2011, on a 12-month trailing basis versus the end of 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 7%, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and delivering $500 million of productivity this year.  Combining this with a more than $700 million of productivity in 2010, we have already surpassed our commitment to deliver $1 billion of working capital productivity between 2010 and 2012. And I'll reaffirm our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2012. 
We ended 2011 with a net debt of $8.5 billion, which is approximately $5 billion more than our position in December of 2010. This increase reflects $7 billion acquisition of Danisco, partially offset by exceptional free cash flow performance for the year. 
I want to give a quick update on our pension contributions. Last week, we made the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan we have communicated to you on Investor Day. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. During 2011, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In summary for the fourth quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one, with agricultural and food markets continuing to be strong while we experienced destocking in several supply chains. In spite of these market conditions, we were able to deliver a double-digit increase in total segment underlying PTOI, which is a testament to our pricing discipline and productivity focus.
Turning now to 2012, we are reaffirming the guidance we gave at Investor Day of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, an increase of 7% to 12% from 2011. However, I'd like to provide you with an update on 2 of our financial assumptions, currency and the tax rate, that were a part of our guidance on Investor Day.  Currency rates remain volatile, and at current rates, we expect the U.S. dollar to be about 6% stronger in 2012 versus our previous assumptions of 3%. The 6% stronger dollar translates to about a $0.25 per share headwind on a year-over-year basis or an additional $0.12 per share headwind versus our previous assumptions. For the first quarter, the stronger dollar is about $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Turning to tax rate. We said in 2012 that the planned rate would be about 22%. We communicated this during Investor Day. We now expect the full year tax rate to be about 23%, which is a $0.05 per share headwind versus the previous guidance, reflecting unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions.
From a market perspective, our assumptions are essentially in line with what we shared with you during Investor Day. We expect to see some of the softness from the fourth quarter continuing in the first quarter, with the industrial markets rebounding further into 2012. For PV, we expect inventories to correct in the second quarter of 2012, followed by a rebound in manufacturing, with growth and installations of about 10% for the full year. 
Consumer electronics, we'll see weak demand early in the year, with market recovery later in the year driven by smartphones and tablets, with good year-over-year growth in 2012. In TiO2, Agriculture and food, the fundamentals remain strong.
While acknowledging that the 2 updated financial assumptions do create downward pressure on the 2012 guidance, it's still very early in the year. Macro conditions remain volatile, including currency, and much could change between now and the end of this year. To combat these challenges, we remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. The businesses are staying close to the customers to better understand demand signals. We know what levers to pull to meet our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership teams remain confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are reaffirming our previous 2012 guidance.
In summary, we had a record year in 2011 in terms of underlying earnings per share. You can once again see the strength of the result that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio to its more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, you can expect us to continue to deliver superior results.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"

Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 8%, with volume gains of 3% and price gains of 5%. The seasonal PTOI loss of $160 million was lower than previous year losses due to increased sales. Fourth quarter does not reflect the majority of any single season since much of the impact of Latin America's summer season is captured in our third quarter results. Most of Brazil's safrinha season is captured in our first quarter results, and most of northern hemisphere sales are captured in our first and second quarter results. 
Our full year performance clearly shows the power of the businesses. Our teams delivered 17% sales growth with 10% volume gains, 6% higher price and 1% impact from portfolio. 30% earnings growth, coupled with industry-leading sales performance, translated into 19% PTOI margins for the segment. The combination of our global infrastructure and the businesses' ability to respond and win in every major market with an intense focus on the customer, demonstrate the power of our business model. This discipline of service and momentum of innovation are the foundation for growth in 2012 and beyond. 
Taking a closer look within the segment, seed fourth quarter sales of $621 million increased 7% based on the close of an exceptional Latin America summer season. Latin America's sales in the second half were up more than 40%, driven by over 55% growth in Brazil's summer corn sales excluding currency, as our L.A. teams mobilized quickly and responded well to the increase in corn hectares. The quarter also captured improved sales in the Philippines and Indonesia, reflecting improved weather conditions and increased planting acres, with our teams capturing more than their share of that increase. 
For the full year 2011, the Pioneer global team delivered another year of market wins, with growing sales, earnings and margin. The incremental contribution was well-balanced between North America and international growth as we predicted coming into 2011. Success was underpinned by new product penetration, increased acreage and share gains in North America, volume growth and value capture in Latin America and success growing in Europe and Asia. Specifically, 2011 seed sales were up 17% to $6.3 billion, reflecting both volume and price contributions. 
In summary, the business delivered on all commitments, including its focus on investing for future growth, ending an outstanding year with the business stronger than ever. And importantly, here's an update on North America. The sales teams have been setting a historic pace as we work closely with customers during a very dynamic cycle. Our order book is ahead of last year, with our volumes tracking in line with growth objectives and the value proposition aligned with customer expectations. At the product level, our newest integrated and reduced refuge product offerings are being embraced and confidence in our soybean performance and confidence in our soybean performance and disease packages are strong. Specifically, we anticipate about 60% of our triples will be converted to AcreMax 1 or AcreMax XTRA. In addition, we're releasing many new hybrids with our AQUAmax technology. 
In soybeans, we have over 30 new varieties and about 60 new products from the last 2 years penetrating our lineup. And 1 final comment as we look forward to 2012, we anticipate AcreMax Extreme regulatory approval in the first half and will be testing this product this season, allowing thousands of farmers to see it in their local fields.
Turning to crop protection products. Sales for the quarter of $676 million grew 9%, reflecting growth across all major product lines in most regions, with the largest contribution for the quarter coming from strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America. All regions achieved double-digit sales growth in the second half, led by the excellent performance in the Latin American market. Importantly, these strong results reflect volume growth and net price gains. 
For the full year 2011, crop protection sales of $2.9 billion grew 16%, including a 3% decline from divested businesses. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr insecticide, which posted sales of about $580 million, growing over 45% in its fourth season with continued market share gains.
Our 2011 successes are many, including an insect control portfolio exceeding $1 billion in sales, continued growth of decosystrobe [ph] and fungicide, and the introduction of new proprietary herbicide blends for expanded weed control options for our customers. We continue to refresh and renew our crop protection portfolio by divesting older chemistries while accelerating our R&D pipeline advancements and new product launches. 
This team continues to execute well with their strategy, which centers on market-driven innovation and game-changing new products. Looking ahead to the first half of 2012 for the Agriculture segment, we expect to increase sales moderately, with mid-single-digit earnings growth. Our assumptions center on strong operating performance in the businesses, delivering both volume growth and pricing gains, offset in part by the transient impacts of input cost increases, continued growth investments and, most notably, significant currency headwinds. The split between quarters hinges on the northern hemisphere season favoring March or April, and currently, that's hard to call. We assume growth investments and, more importantly, currency headwind will be more heavily weighted to the first quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $630 million declined 18% compared to the same period last year, with 33% lower volume offset by 15% higher prices, essentially metals pass-through. Pretax earnings of $42 million or $56 million lower than the same period last year due to inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in consumer electronics and plasma displays. Also included in this quarter's earnings is $20 million of licensing income from our partner in the development of advance OLEDs.
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chain. We believe these excess inventory levels will continue through the first half of 2012. We expect PV installations to grow at 10% this year, with a rebound in demand during the second half of the year. 
For first quarter, E&C sales and earnings are expected to be substantially lower than prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and softness in consumer electronics and strong first quarter comps. Excluding the fourth quarter licensing income, we expect segment PTOI to be up sequentially. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $289 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's enzyme business and DuPont's commercial biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed, with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including $6 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. For the first quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be in line with fourth quarter results. We continue to see good growth across these product lines and anticipate PTOI margin expansion for the full year.
Moving to Slide 11 in our Nutrition & Health segment. Sales of $806 million grew 138%, with the acquisition impact from the Danisco specialty food ingredients business. Earnings of $52 million reflected sales more than offsetting integration costs and includes $20 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. In Solae, specialty soy products increased volume and price with the continued penetration into health-related products. Sales growth in specialty was offset by lower soy crushed feed sales, in line with the business objective to shift mix to higher value offerings. Earnings growth reflected a positive mix shift and productivity improvement.
The acquired businesses of health and protection and enablers grew, on a pro forma basis, about 4%, as pricing gains were offset in part by lower volumes due to destocking.
Moving to the outlook. The segment is on track for the full benefit of planned cost synergies to positively contribute to 2012 performance. The benefit will mount throughout the year, reflecting the implementation schedule. Specifically, for the first quarter, we expect sales of the combined segment in the range of $800 million to $850 million, with portfolio impact as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth on higher sales and cost synergies, coupled with the sales improvements, will reflect sequential improvement in margins in the range of mid- to high-single digits, inclusive of amortization.
Now on Slide 12, Performance Chemicals. Sales of $1.9 billion increased 12%, primarily due to higher selling prices. Both businesses in this segment demonstrated double-digit sales increases overall, with the most strength from North America. As we shared last quarter, TiO2 markets paused with fiscal tightening in China and Eurozone concerns, leading to substantial short-term demand decline and destocking in the value chains. Even with this expected softness, the segment delivered PTOI of $433 million, a 37% increase versus last year due to enhanced pricing in TiO2 and fluoropolymers and continued emphasis on fixed cost productivity.
For 2012, we expect global demand growth and see signs of strengthening, first in North American markets. Leading indicators point to an improving TiO2 outlook, with North American order patterns consistent with recovery to a more typical seasonal demand profile across 2 quarters.
Additionally, fluoropolymers demand remains strong. As a result, first quarter sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI up substantially. With 8 decades experience in this industry, our confidence in TiO2 demand fundamentals remains intact, and we are proceeding with the TiO2 capacity expansion as announced.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 8% on 10% stronger pricing, offsetting 2% lower volume. The segment had price increases in all of its major market segments to offset the higher cost of raw materials. Auto builds were flat to down in all regions except North America, where builds were up 17%. And there was strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. 
PTOI of $58 million decreased $13 million, primarily due to mix impact and a $7 million settlement. For the first quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year, with earnings up significantly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 2% in the first quarter, with full year builds expected to be up about 4% globally. This segment is driving actions in all product lines to offset higher raw material costs, with continued productivity to improve margin.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales were up 1% based on 14% selling price increase, offsetting a destocking-led drop in volume. While underlying automotive markets were growing, value-chain destocking was most evident in Europe and appeared to finish in North America. Electronics was soft while packaging markets were stable. 
Absent the one-time $31 million benefit last year, PTOI was down $24 million or about 14% on lower volume. For the first quarter, we expect sales down modestly as price increases essentially mitigate softer volume and PTOI down substantially on volumes, driven mostly by a weaker Europe and conservative channel inventory management. Global auto builds are expected to grow at 2% and packaging demand remain stable. 
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 10% on a combination of pricing and portfolio change, partially offset by 2% lower volume. Sales grew in all regions, led by Asia Pacific at 22%. PTOI was $94 million, essentially flat versus last year as portfolio change and selling price offset softer volumes and higher raw material costs. Additionally, the prior year included a net charge of $11 million for one-time items.
For the first quarter, market fundamentals remain noisy for our advanced material offerings, with some improvement in North American demand and continued growth in Latin America. We see improvement in law enforcement and fiberoptic cable markets, as our Kevlar XP and Kevlar AP continue to be well received in the market. Our consulting and CleanTech offerings continue to see moderate demand up globally. Overall, sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI down moderately. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

So as we look ahead to 2012, we expect modest sales growth and reaffirm our earnings outlook for 7% to 12% growth. After a challenging fourth quarter, we anticipate conditions will improve in many of our industrial businesses as the year plays out. 
Our growth outlook varies by region and by business. We see Asia demand recovering from the slowdown we saw on the fourth quarter. We continue to expect slow, sequential recovery in the U.S. and weak demand in many European markets. We're poised for a very strong year ahead in Agriculture. Our order books for seeds is at a historic pace, is ahead of last year and consistent with our expectations for strong underlying growth. In crop protection, product expansions will contribute to 2012 results. 
We have an important milestone with the initial launch of Cyazypyr in the second half, which, over time, when coupled with Rynaxypyr, we expect to hit $1 billion in sales. With respect to TiO2, we expect markets to tighten by midyear, with the North American economy supporting a coating season comparable to last year, along with restocking of the value chain in Asia. For the full year, we expect TiO2 sales volume to meet or exceed 2011 levels. 
Our expectation for company volume in the first quarter are cautious. We expect volumes for many of our industrial businesses to be up sequentially versus the fourth quarter but down year-over-year against strong comps in the first quarter of 2011.  At this point, many of our supply chain inventories are low, and we expect demand to pick up slowly, starting late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. 
One exception where destocking continues in the first quarter is photovoltaics. We're seeing positive signs that production will pick up again by midyear and expect PV installations to grow about 10% this year. 
At today's exchange rates, currency will be a headwind for our businesses, and Nick mentioned this. We have the entire year ahead of us to manage contingency to compensate. 
We'll continue to be disciplined in our execution, whether it's in the advancement of one of our R&D pipelines, a customer collaboration at one of our innovation centers or a productivity initiative. We are well positioned for recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint. And we look ahead with confidence in our ability to execute well and deliver growth in 2012. 
Karen, back to you."

I would suggest that it's a good business at the depth of it, and it's a fantastic business at the peak. And over the cycle, we get very strong segment returns for this business. And that's driven by our competitive advantage from our manufacturing process technology. And as you see, it isn't just a great cash generator for us. So when you have a pure cyclical commodity and at the depths of the cycle, you're still making a great return for the company, it is worthy of investment. And so that's where it hits. The other thing is we haven't put a new line, a major line into that business. The last one that opened up was in Kuan Yin in Taiwan, and that was 1994, maybe. And so it's been a while and -- from that standpoint. On PV, we've seen, obviously, the metal pass-through. If you take that away, it's all about the efficiency of the sell and what it delivers. We were seeing PV module prices come down as commensurate with the increases in efficiency in the modules themselves. And that's when you saw some of the support from some of the governments kind of go away. The economics largely remain the same. The margins are holding. And I do believe it's because things like army Solamet paste, which offers higher efficiency, enables that equation to work."

We've seen it in Brazil, we've seen it in Argentina, and I think we'll continue to -- Latin America will continue to be a very important sector for us."

That's going to be about where it's coming out, maybe just slightly better than that. But on a cents per share basis, it's going to hold about the same. On a dilution basis, on an EPS basis, number of shares, I think the work we've been doing in that area is pretty evident in the fourth quarter. We bought back $0.25 million first quarter of '11, we bought back another $0.25 million in the third quarter. Another quarter -- so if you look over a period of time there, we brought we bought back close to $1 billion worth of shares, which is looking to control the dilution over that 18-month period. And we'll continue to -- that practice as we go forward. As you know, we have plans in place that have already been authorized by the board, $2 billion in the newest, which was authorized in 2011, and we still have $100 million from the prior plan available to us. So we'll continue to do buybacks to deal with dilution from a compensation perspective that might occur."

Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011,",1085,"Great. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011, net of acquisitions, were Performance Chemicals and Agriculture. Sales in developing markets were up 27%, and that represents 34% of company sales.
Market-driven science is critical to our success, and we expect to have about 30% of 2011 sales come from products that were introduced in the past 4 years, and we'll be finalizing that data in February.
Fixed cost and working capital productivity surpassed the targets we set for the year. Fixed cost productivity exceeded our target by $100 million, and working capital productivity beat the target by $200 million. Variable cost productivity programs, they also delivered comparable results. 
DuPont delivered a record $3.93 per share in 2011 on an underlying basis, which is up 20% versus 2010, capping off a very strong year with broad-based contributions. We ended the year with $3.3 billion in free cash flow compared to $3.1 billion last year, an improvement of 8%.
During the fourth quarter, we faced several headwinds. When we updated our full year guidance on December 9, we pointed to market softness in electronics and customers' conservative year-end cash management with further destocking in polymer and industrial supply chain. We have also made clear that the photovoltaic inventory correction continued through the quarter. These factors combined to press volume down 10%. Despite these difficult conditions, underlying earnings were up in the fourth quarter when adjusted for the differences in tax rate year-over-year. Our earnings performance demonstrates an ability to execute extremely well in volatile and uncertain markets. It is our view that fourth quarter volume performance was strongly impacted by cash conservation and supply chain actions, and did not reflect broad macro conditions. 
There was GDP growth in the quarter in most regions, with growth also projected for 2012. The good news is that caution in the fourth quarter means that many supply chain inventories are fit. We expect some conservatism to linger in the first quarter, with a rebound effect likely to come in the second quarter, and I'll provide a more detailed perspective on how we see the rebound effect playing out later on this call.
To further illustrate my point that fourth quarter volume was primarily a function of cash conservation and supply chain restocking rather than macro conditions, I'll share fourth quarter perspectives on key markets. Let's start with electronics, where continued destocking in PV was expected. As the channel corrects for significant overproduction in the first half of 2011, we expect destocking to be completed by midyear, perhaps sooner, with PV installations to be up about 10% in 2012. Remember, PV sales represent about 40% of the electronics segment. For consumer electronics, the seasonal decline in orders was more than expected, in part due to delays in launch timing for next generation smartphones and tablet PCs, coupled with some destocking and caution in the value chain through the quarter. Auto builds were essentially flat, with gains in the U.S. and Japan offset by declines in every other region. Our Performance Materials segment was affected by destocking in their supply chain, most notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. As expected, the titanium dioxide market experienced a pause, with volumes down and prices up year-over-year. For added perspective, our full year TiO2 volume was down modestly in 2011 versus a sold-out position in 2010, and expectations for volume growth in 2012. TiO2 demand, on average, tends to follow GDP, and with no major tranches of new capacity coming on in the next 24 months, we expect this market to remain strong, with solid fundamentals and healthy returns.
And speaking of strong market fundamentals, our ag businesses continue to deliver impressive results. Fourth quarter sales were up 8% on 3% volume growth. However, the real story is the Latin American summer season, which primarily spans our third and fourth quarters. So for the second half, the ag segment sales were up 23%, and underlying PTOI was up 43%. These outstanding results reflect a constant press of product lineup in Latin America, with industry-leading germplasm, coupled with more than 85% insect rate penetration in Brazil corn.  Our Right Product, Right Acre approach is delivering strong sales, share gains and, most importantly, delighted customers. 
Pulling this all together, we dealt with a wide range of market conditions at year-end. We remain close to our customers, often taking advantage of market positives to accelerate new product valuations. 
So I'd like to highlight a few innovation achievements as we closed out the year. In the fourth quarter, we announced a licensing agreement with a major Asian manufacturer for OLED technology. This acknowledges that we have achieved a major milestone in demonstrating technology that enables large displays to be produced at significantly lower cost than competing technologies. And we're quickly moving into small-scale semi-works production where we would develop basic data and supply materials for prove out by interested partners.
Rynaxypyr insecticide sales reached $580 million this year, with a strong finish in Latin America and Asia. For context, this means this product line represents about 20% of total sales in our crop protection business. We look forward to the launching of the next product in this family, Cyazypyr, in the later part of 2012. 
We received regulatory approval last summer for the next wave of integrated and reduced refuge products, Optimum AcreMax and Optimum AcreMax XTRA, which will deliver significant value this year for our customers. And we look forward to the regulatory approval of AcreMax Extreme in the first half of 2012. 
And last month, the Society of Plastics Engineers announced their award for Most Innovative Use of Plastic, and DuPont products were featured in 3 separate awards for Ford, Fiat and Toyota. Two of the innovative components featured renewably sourced material, including our bio-based Sorona polymer in the carpeting application. 
Finally, for the 2011 year, DuPont was granted a total of 910 U.S. patents, the highest number for a single year in the company's history, and I'm extremely proud of our scientists who developed these proprietary innovations and of our marketers whose understanding of customers' unmet needs shaped these research and development programs. 
So now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for a detailed review of the financial results of the quarter, and then I'll share my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"

Earnings per share were $0.35 on an underlying basis compared to $0.50 in the prior year. The decrease here was due to the significantly higher tax rate, which was a negative $0.23 per share impact year-over-year. 
Consolidated net sales of $8.4 billion were up 14% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 14%, with double-digit increases in all regions, reflecting our continued strong discipline of pricing for value. The Danisco acquisition was the primary driver for the 10% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was down 10%, primarily reflecting supply chain destocking that Ellen has already covered.
Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the fourth quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 5. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.43 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to successfully implement price increases, pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver. On a full year basis, this spread was a positive $1.41 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 15% versus last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw an increase of 13% over 2010, and this includes about 3 percentage points for metals, which, as you know, is passed through. As we indicated in December, we expect an increase of about 4% for the full year 2012.
Volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.20 per share. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. The decline in volume reflects decreases in all regions and all segments, except for Agriculture, reflecting the market environment that Ellen has previously discussed. On a full year basis, total company volume was up 1%, with ag volume up 10%.
Continuing with our variance analysis, let's now move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.17 per share, and this was primarily driven by actions in the fourth quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 capacity expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at some of our existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration of the marketplace.
On a full year basis, fixed costs were 40% of sales versus 42% last year, well on our way to meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrent with the actions to support growth, we delivered more than $400 million of fixed cost savings in 2011. As we told you during Investor Day last month, we expect to deliver another $300 million of fixed-cost productivity in 2012.  Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter and $0.17 on a full year basis.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates and cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is shown on Schedule D in the earnings news release to depict the exact number our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Income tax on the EPS waterfall is a $0.23 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter, which was 27.5%, versus a negative 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year tax rate of 22% was higher than our expected full year tax rate of 21%, reflecting an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. This impact was recognized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a higher 27.5% rate. Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the full year tax rate was lower than expected because of 100% of the U.S. R&D tax credit which was recorded in the quarter, and it resulted in a negative 14.9% rate.  The full year 2011 impact of the 22% tax rate versus our previous guidance of 21% is about a $0.05 per share headwind. 
Next on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. This includes earnings, additional interest and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that were not included in our one-time items. On a full year reported basis, Danisco diluted earnings by $0.13 a share. This includes underlying results of $0.09, offset by significant items associated with the transaction and cost to achieve synergies of $0.22 per share. As we discussed during Investor Day, we are committed to achieving at least $130 million of cost synergies in 2012, which is a full year ahead of original expectation.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 6. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 14% in the quarter and 27% for the full year. 
Turning now to balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. We ended the year with $3.3 billion of free cash flow versus the prior year of $3.1 billion. This outstanding performance is the result of strong sales and earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity.  At the end of 2011, on a 12-month trailing basis versus the end of 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 7%, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and delivering $500 million of productivity this year.  Combining this with a more than $700 million of productivity in 2010, we have already surpassed our commitment to deliver $1 billion of working capital productivity between 2010 and 2012. And I'll reaffirm our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2012. 
We ended 2011 with a net debt of $8.5 billion, which is approximately $5 billion more than our position in December of 2010. This increase reflects $7 billion acquisition of Danisco, partially offset by exceptional free cash flow performance for the year. 
I want to give a quick update on our pension contributions. Last week, we made the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan we had communicated to you on Investor Day. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. During 2011, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In summary for the fourth quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one, with agricultural and food markets continuing to be strong while we experienced destocking in several supply chains. In spite of these market conditions, we were able to deliver a double-digit increase in total segment underlying PTOI, which is a testament to our pricing discipline and productivity focus.
Turning now to 2012, we are reaffirming the guidance we gave at Investor Day of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, an increase of 7% to 12% from 2011. However, I'd like to provide you with an update on 2 of our financial assumptions, currency and the tax rate, that were a part of our guidance on Investor Day.  Currency rates remain volatile, and at current rates, we expect the U.S. dollar to be about 6% stronger in 2012 versus our previous assumptions of 3%. The 6% stronger dollar translates to about a $0.25 per share headwind on a year-over-year basis or an additional $0.12 per share headwind versus our previous assumptions. For the first quarter, the stronger dollar is about $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Turning to tax rate. We said in 2012 that the planned rate would be about 22%. We communicated this during Investor Day. We now expect the full year tax rate to be about 23%, which is a $0.05 per share headwind versus the previous guidance, reflecting unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions.
From a market perspective, our assumptions are essentially in line with what we shared with you during Investor Day. We expect to see some of the softness from the fourth quarter continuing in the first quarter, with the industrial markets rebounding further into 2012. For PV, we expect inventories to correct in the second quarter of 2012, followed by a rebound in manufacturing, with growth and installations of about 10% for the full year. 
Consumer electronics, we'll see weak demand early in the year, with market recovery later in the year driven by smartphones and tablets, with good year-over-year growth in 2012. In TiO2, Agriculture and food, the fundamentals remain strong.
While acknowledging that the 2 updated financial assumptions do create downward pressure on the 2012 guidance, it's still very early in the year. Macro conditions remain volatile, including currency, and much could change between now and the end of this year. To combat these challenges, we remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. The businesses are staying close to the customers to better understand demand signals. We know what levers to pull to meet our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership teams remain confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are reaffirming our previous 2012 guidance.
In summary, we had a record year in 2011 in terms of underlying earnings per share. You can once again see the strength of the result that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio to its more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, you can expect us to continue to deliver superior results.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"
268053,118466582,210011,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. We'll start with our segment review with Agriculture on Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 8%, with volume gains of 3% and price gains of 5%. The seasonal PTOI loss of $116 million was lower than previous year losses due",1993,"Thanks, Nick. We'll start with our segment review with Agriculture on Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 8%, with volume gains of 3% and price gains of 5%. The seasonal PTOI loss of $116 million was lower than previous year losses due to increased sales. Fourth quarter does not reflect the majority of any single season since much of the impact of Latin America's summer season is captured in our third quarter results. Most of Brazil's Safrinha season is captured in our first quarter results, and most of northern hemisphere sales are captured in our first and second quarter results. 
Our full year performance clearly shows the power of the businesses. Our teams delivered 17% sales growth with 10% volume gains, 6% higher price and 1% impact from portfolio. 30% earnings growth, coupled with industry-leading sales performance, translated into 19% PTOI margins for the segment. The combination of our global infrastructure and the businesses' ability to respond and win in every major market with an intense focus on the customer, demonstrate the power of our business model. This discipline of service and momentum of innovation are the foundation for growth in 2012 and beyond. 
Taking a closer look within the segment, seed fourth quarter sales of $621 million increased 7% based on the close of an exceptional Latin America summer season. Latin America's sales in the second half were up more than 40%, driven by over 55% growth in Brazil's summer corn sales excluding currency, as our L.A. teams mobilized quickly and responded well to the increase in corn hectares. The quarter also captured improved sales in the Philippines and Indonesia, reflecting improved weather conditions and increased planting acres, with our teams capturing more than their share of that increase. 
For the full year 2011, the Pioneer global team delivered another year of market wins, with growing sales, earnings and margin. The incremental contribution was well-balanced between North America and international growth as we predicted coming into 2011. Success was underpinned by new product penetration, increased acreage and share gains in North America, volume growth and value capture in Latin America and success growing in Europe and Asia. Specifically, 2011 seed sales were up 17% to $6.3 billion, reflecting both volume and price contributions. 
In summary, the business delivered on all commitments, including its focus on investing for future growth, ending an outstanding year with the business stronger than ever. And importantly, here's an update on North America. The sales teams have been setting a historic pace as we work closely with customers during a very dynamic cycle. Our order book is ahead of last year, with our volumes tracking in line with growth objectives and the value proposition aligned with customer expectations. At the product level, our newest integrated and reduced refuge product offerings are being embraced. And confidence in our soybean performance and confidence in our soybean performance and disease packages are strong. Specifically, we anticipate about 60% of our triples will be converted to AcreMax 1 or AcreMax XTRA. In addition, we're releasing many new hybrids with our AQUAmax technology. 
In soybeans, we have over 30 new varieties and about 60 new products from the last 2 years penetrating our lineup. And one final comment as we look forward to 2012, we anticipate AcreMax Extreme regulatory approval in the first half and will be testing this product this season, allowing thousands of farmers to see it in their local fields.
Turning to crop protection products. Sales for the quarter of $676 million grew 9%, reflecting growth across all major product lines in most regions, with the largest contribution for the quarter coming from strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America. All regions achieved double-digit sales growth in the second half, led by the excellent performance in the Latin American market. Importantly, these strong results reflect volume growth and net price gains. 
For the full year 2011, crop protection sales of $2.9 billion grew 16%, including a 3% decline from divested businesses. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr insecticide, which posted sales of about $580 million, growing over 45% in its fourth season with continued market share gains.
Our 2011 successes are many, including an insect control portfolio exceeding $1 billion in sales, continued growth of decosystrobe [ph] and fungicide, and the introduction of new proprietary herbicide blends for expanded weed control options for our customers. We continue to refresh and renew our crop protection portfolio by divesting older chemistries while accelerating our R&D pipeline advancements and new product launches. 
This team continues to execute well with their strategy, which centers on market-driven innovation and game-changing new products. Looking ahead to the first half of 2012 for the Agriculture segment, we expect to increase sales moderately, with mid-single-digit earnings growth. Our assumptions center on strong operating performance in the businesses, delivering both volume growth and pricing gains, offset in part by the transient impacts of input cost increases, continued growth investments and, most notably, significant currency headwinds. The split between quarters hinges on the northern hemisphere season favoring March or April, and currently, that's hard to call. We assume growth investments and, more importantly, currency headwind will be more heavily weighted to the first quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $630 million declined 18% compared to the same period last year, with 33% lower volume offset by 15% higher prices, essentially metals pass-through. Pretax earnings of $42 million were $56 million lower than the same period last year due to inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in consumer electronics and plasma displays. Also included in this quarter's earnings is $20 million of licensing income from our partner in the development of advanced OLEDs.
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chains. We believe these excess inventory levels will continue through the first half of 2012. We expect PV installations to grow at 10% this year, with a rebound in demand during the second half of the year. 
For first quarter, E&C sales and earnings are expected to be substantially lower than prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and softness in consumer electronics and strong first quarter comps. Excluding the fourth quarter licensing income, we expect segment PTOI to be up sequentially. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $289 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's enzyme business and DuPont's commercial biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed, with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including $6 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. For the first quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be in line with fourth quarter results. We continue to see good growth across these product lines and anticipate PTOI margin expansion for the full year.
Moving to Slide 11 in our Nutrition & Health segment. Sales of $806 million grew 138%, with the acquisition impact from the Danisco specialty food ingredients business. Earnings of $52 million reflected sales more than offsetting integration costs and includes $20 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. In Solae, specialty soy products increased volume and price with the continued penetration into health-related products. Sales growth in specialty was offset by lower soy crushed feed sales, in line with the business objective to shift mix to higher value offerings. Earnings growth reflected a positive mix shift and productivity improvements.
The acquired businesses of health and protection and enablers grew, on a pro forma basis, about 4%, as pricing gains were offset in part by lower volumes due to destocking.
Moving to the outlook. The segment is on track for the full benefit of planned cost synergies to positively contribute to 2012 performance. The benefit will mount throughout the year, reflecting the implementation schedule. Specifically, for the first quarter, we expect sales of the combined segment in the range of $800 million to $850 million, with portfolio impact as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth on higher sales and cost synergies, coupled with the sales improvements, will reflect sequential improvement in margins in the range of mid- to high-single digits, inclusive of amortization.
Now on Slide 12, Performance Chemicals. Sales of $1.9 billion increased 12%, primarily due to higher selling prices. Both businesses in this segment demonstrated double-digit sales increases overall, with the most strength from North America. As we shared last quarter, TiO2 markets paused with fiscal tightening in China and Eurozone concerns, leading to substantial short-term demand decline and destocking in the value chains. Even with this expected softness, the segment delivered PTOI of $433 million, a 37% increase versus last year due to enhanced pricing in TiO2 and fluoropolymers and continued emphasis on fixed cost productivity.
For 2012, we expect global demand growth and see signs of strengthening, first in North American markets. Leading indicators point to an improving TiO2 outlook, with North American order patterns consistent with recovery to a more typical seasonal demand profile across 2 quarters.
Additionally, fluoropolymers demand remains strong. As a result, first quarter sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI up substantially. With 8 decades experience in this industry, our confidence in TiO2 demand fundamentals remains intact, and we are proceeding with the TiO2 capacity expansion as announced.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 8% on 10% stronger pricing, offsetting 2% lower volume. The segment had price increases in all of its major market segments to offset the higher cost of raw materials. Auto builds were flat to down in all regions except North America, where builds were up 17%. And there was strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. 
PTOI of $58 million decreased $13 million, primarily due to mix impact and a $7 million settlement. For the first quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year, with earnings up significantly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 2% in the first quarter, with full year builds expected to be up about 4% globally. This segment is driving actions in all product lines to offset higher raw material costs, with continued productivity to improve margins.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales were up 1% based on 14% selling price increase, offsetting a destocking-led drop in volume. While underlying automotive markets were growing, value-chain destocking was most evident in Europe and appeared to finish in North America. Electronics was soft while packaging markets were stable. 
Absent the one-time $31 million benefit last year, PTOI was down $24 million or about 14% on lower volume. For the first quarter, we expect sales down modestly as price increases essentially mitigate softer volume and PTOI down substantially on volumes, driven mostly by a weaker Europe and conservative channel inventory management. Global auto builds are expected to grow at 2% and packaging demand remain stable. 
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 10% on a combination of pricing and portfolio change, partially offset by 2% lower volume. Sales grew in all regions, led by Asia Pacific at 22%. PTOI was $94 million, essentially flat versus last year as portfolio change and selling price offset softer volumes and higher raw material costs. Additionally, the prior year included a net charge of $11 million for one-time items.
For the first quarter, market fundamentals remain noisy for our advanced material offerings, with some improvement in North American demand and continued growth in Latin America. We see improvement in law enforcement and fiberoptic cable markets, as our Kevlar XP and Kevlar AP continue to be well received in the market. Our consulting and CleanTech offerings continue to see moderate demand up globally. Overall, sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI down moderately. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

So as we look ahead to 2012, we expect modest sales growth and reaffirmed our earnings outlook for 7% to 12% growth. After a challenging fourth quarter, we anticipate conditions will improve in many of our industrial businesses as the year plays out. 
Our growth outlook varies by region and by business. We see Asia demand recovering from the slowdown we saw on the fourth quarter. We continue to expect slow, sequential recovery in the U.S. and weak demand in many European markets. We're poised for a very strong year ahead in Agriculture. Our order books for seeds is at a historic pace, it's ahead of last year and consistent with our expectations for strong underlying growth. In crop protection, product expansions will contribute to 2012 results. 
We have an important milestone with the initial launch of Cyazypyr in the second half, which, over time, when coupled with Rynaxypyr, we expect to hit $1 billion in sales. With respect to TiO2, we expect markets to tighten by midyear, with the North American economy supporting a coating season comparable to last year, along with restocking of the value chain in Asia. For the full year, we expect TiO2 sales volume to meet or exceed 2011 levels. 
Our expectation for company volume in the first quarter are cautious. We expect volumes for many of our industrial businesses to be up sequentially versus the fourth quarter but down year-over-year against strong comps in the first quarter of 2011.  At this point, many of our supply chain inventories are low, and we expect demand to pick up slowly, starting late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. 
One exception where destocking continues in the first quarter is photovoltaics. We're seeing some positive signs that production will pick up again by midyear and expect PV installations to grow about 10% this year. 
At today's exchange rates, currency will be a headwind for our businesses, and Nick mentioned this. We have the entire year ahead of us to manage contingency to compensate. 
We'll continue to be disciplined in our execution, whether it's in the advancement of one of our R&D pipelines, a customer collaboration at one of our innovation centers or a productivity initiative. We are well positioned for recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint. And we look ahead with confidence in our ability to execute well and deliver growth in 2012. 
Karen, back to you."

I would suggest that it's a good business at the depth of it, and it's a fantastic business at the peak. And over the cycle, we get very strong segment returns for this business. And that's driven by our competitive advantage from our manufacturing process technology. And as you see, it isn't just a great cash generator for us. So when you have a pure cyclical commodity and at the depths of the cycle, you're still making a great return for the company, it is worthy of investment. And so that's where it hits. The other thing is we haven't put a new line, a major line into that business. The last one that opened up was in Kuan Yin in Taiwan, and that was 1994, maybe. And so it's been a while and -- from that standpoint. On PV, we've seen, obviously, the metal pass-through. If you take that away, it's all about the efficiency of the cell and what it delivers. We were seeing PV module prices come down as commensurate with the increases in efficiency in the modules themselves. And that's when you saw some of the support from some of the governments kind of go away. The economics largely remain the same. The margins are holding. And I do believe it's because things like army Solamet paste, which offers higher efficiency, enables that equation to work."

And I think if you look at North American planting, they're going to take that into consideration. We have the new AQUAmax technology out in 2012. We're very excited about what that means. It looks like it's about a 5-bushel per unit positive on the impact. So we're very excited about that. But the current corn soy prices these days does favor corn.

On a dilution basis, on an EPS basis, number of shares, I think the work we've been doing in that area is pretty evident in the fourth quarter. We bought back $0.25 million first quarter of '11, we bought back another $0.25 million in the third quarter. Another quarter -- so if you look over a period of time there, we brought -- bought back close to $1 billion worth of shares, which is looking to control the dilution over that 18-month period. And we'll continue to -- that practice as we go forward. As you know, we have plans in place that have already been authorized by the board, $2 billion in the newest, which was authorized in 2011, and we still have $100 million from the prior plan available to us.

We had a little volume decline in the fourth quarter based on some refinish destocking that we've seen. But all in all, I think they had a solid year. Their productivity plans continue to deliver on those, and I think that they're in an improving environment. So they're gaining some momentum.
So thank you, all. Great to talk to you today, and we look forward to catching up with you soon."

The past delivered strong results in the first quarter in line with our expectation at a time when markets were mixed. Sales were up 12% with 5% organic growth and 7% from acquisitions with excellent price-performance in the quarter driven in part by new product introductions, which were up more than 50% versus prior year. Not surprisingly, Pioneer had one of the largest year-over-year increases in its area. Productivity projects are tracking well across our businesses. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with very sharp execution drove double-digit growth in sales and operating income this quarter. 
With respect to key markets, Agriculture is strong with favorable farmer economics, increased corn acres in Europe and North America and outstanding momentum from our business in 2011 carrying into this year. Global auto builds were up 4% in the quarter with North America builds up 17% according to the third-party market data that we used. In photovoltaics, we expect destocking to and in the second quarter, and the industry will resume a more balanced production schedule. Consumer electronics is improving, and growth is very much a function of new application introduction such as next-generation smartphones and tablets. For industrial markets, our Performance Chemical, Performance Materials, Safety and Production segment volumes were down versus very strong comps in the prior year. Sequentially, volumes improved even when adjusting for seasonality and indicating -- I think this indicates a positive shift in momentum, and we anticipate these segments will return to year-over-year volume growth within the next 1 to 2 quarters. We continue to win in our market through innovation. Our customers are benefiting from DuPont's valuable and meaningful product differentiation that enables them to serve their own end markets better. Here's just a couple of examples of DuPont's latest value-added innovations. Our expanded offering of optimum AcreMax insect-resistant corn hybrids for our farmers this season, and a next-generation [indiscernible that improves efficiency of the solar module and we had overwhelming response to our recent introduction of Solamet PV17. 
I was in India last month and met with several customers and I also had the chance to tour our research and development laboratory and Hyderabad and the newest DuPont innovation center in Kona. Like our other innovation centers, this one engages our customers and allows our teams to truly engage in meaningful product and design opportunity to help differentiate them in their markets. And in turn, DuPont's rewarded with premium market position and greater customer loyalty. What you should take away from the first quarter is that we're off to a good start for the year. We expected slow sequential improvement, and that is what we're seeing. DuPont's well-positioned in our market, and we're executing with focused and discipline. Despite challenging conditions in certain markets, we delivered 12% growth in operating income this quarter. I'm now going to turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter, and then I'll elaborate on my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"

DuPont delivered a record first quarter with underlying earnings per share of $1.61.

DuPont delivered a record first quarter with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Our strong performance reflects discipline and focus on innovation, productivity and differential management in spite of volatile macro conditions. 
I'd like to review the details of the quarter starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of sales and earnings results. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased over $250 million or 12% overcoming headwinds relating to currency, higher pension costs and a decrease in Pharmaceuticals income. Excluding Pharmaceuticals income, this is the 10th consecutive quarter that we've been able to deliver double-digit increases, and this outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio. Underlying earnings of $1.61 per share increased 6% compared to $1.52 in the prior year as these strong operating results were partially offset by $0.10 of headwinds relating to Texas and exchange gains and losses. Consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion were up 12% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 8% with increases in all regions and all segments, reflecting our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added another 7% to sales. Volume was down 2% from the near peak level in the first quarter of 2011. This decline is consistent with the market environment that Ellen just described. Sequentially, volumes improved indicating a positive shift in momentum as we head into the second quarter. An example of this is in China where volumes grew each month during the first quarter. Even with the Chinese lunar New Year, volumes were up approximately 10% versus the fourth quarter, and we expect this positive trend to continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's turn into a corporate view of the first quarter looking at EPS analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.45 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, this was the ninth consecutive quarter in which we successfully implemented price increases on a year-over-year basis. Excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes first quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 7% versus last year's first quarter. This cost increases have moderated from the fourth quarter, and for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 3% versus our previous assumptions of 4%. The 1 percentage point improvement is primarily a result of lower natural gas and ethane costs, along with a more advantageous mix of ores in our titanium dioxide business. Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.01 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.20 per share, excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes. This was mainly driven by actions in the first quarter to support growth such as increased investments in ag, higher cost associated with operating our annual Kevlar back in Cooper River and TiO2 capacity expansions, as well as R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at time when existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration in the marketplace. I'd also like to note that they $0.20 includes a $0.04 higher noncash pension cost. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we delivered approximately $100 million of fixed cost productivity in the first quarter. We're well on our way to delivering against our commitment of $300 million for the full year. Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for the full year. For the second quarter, the stronger dollar is anticipated to be about an $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a $0.07 benefit. Although this does primarily reflect the acquisition of Danisco, it also includes a couple of smaller divestitures and acquisitions that were made to further enhance the strength of our portfolio. Speaking of Danisco, I want to just take a moment to give a quick update on how pleased I am with the status of the integration. We continue to make excellent progress with respect to the cost and revenue synergies that we have targeted. And I always knew that Danisco had exceptional science capabilities, however, I recently had a chance to see this firsthand when I visited genencor's R&D facility in Palo Alto. And let me say, I came away very impressed with the facility, the energy of the scientists and the projects that are currently being developed within the R&D pipeline. After that visit, I have become even more enthusiastic about the potential of the combined businesses and the innovations that we can expect in the future. 
Turning back to the waterfall chart. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal is to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program, however, there was volatility in exchange rates, coupled with the cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings during the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the exact impact of our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax on the EPS waterfall was a $0.06 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter of 23.9% versus 21.3% last year. As expected, the increase in the base tax rate primarily reflects an increase proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of R&D and other tax credits which expired at the end of 2011. We continue to expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be 23%. Lastly, other on the waterfall shows a negative $0.06 variance, including a $0.02 headwind from reduced pharmaceutical royalties. First quarter pharma income of $27 million was in line with our expectations, and we're still estimating full year 2012 pharma income to be about $50 million which represents about $240 million decline from 2011. There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. We delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 15% in the first quarter led by growth in Agriculture. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $2.2 billion versus an outflow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This change was primarily due to the $500 million cash contribution to the U.S. principal pension plan that was made in January of this year. At the end of the first quarter on a 12-month trailing basis, first quarter of '11, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 5 percentage points, excluding the Danisco impact reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity for the full year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our AA2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that. 
Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. We paid our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Additionally, in the first quarter, the company initiated a $400 million share repurchase program which will be completed no later than May. This program begins to tap into the $2 billion share repurchase plan that was approved by the board last year. 
In summary, for the first quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one and played out as we had expected. Global volume for the company declined on a year-over-year bases but improved sequentially. In spite of challenging market conditions, we delivered double-digit increases in underlying total segment PTOI which is a testament to our portfolio diversity, pricing discipline and productivity focus. 
Turning now to the second quarter. We expect a strong finish to the northern hemisphere planning season. Additionally, we expect the sequential volume growth we experienced in the first quarter to continue particularly in PV, consumer electronics, TiO2 and automotive markets. Jim and Karen will provide more details when they cover the individual segments. For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 per share excluding significant items. The midpoint of our full year earnings guidance suggest we will grow earnings by 12% over the remaining 3 quarters, and we are well-positioned to do just that. We continue to expect slow sequential movement against a backdrop of dynamic markets. The businesses affected by these dynamic conditions are taking actions in a variety of ways to mitigate the effects, including producing expenditures and tightly managing cash. Our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to changing demand signals and to continue to service those customer needs. We remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in the business plans and in our ability to execute against those plans. With that, going to turn the call over to Jim to review the Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. Jim?"

The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics. Our team has delivered growth in every region around the world as our footprint continues to expand at an impressive pace. On Slide 7, you'll see that sales grew 15% to $4.1 billion with 8% price and 8% volume gains. Earnings were up 18% to $1.3 billion on higher volume and prices more than offsetting input cost increases, unfavorable currency impact and continued growth investments. 
Starting with seed sales, first quarter reached $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Corn sales growth in North America was the leading contributor, coupled with impressive results from an early strong start in Europe and robust Brazil corn season sales. Specifically in North America, our direct sales teams are working closely with our customers to ensure the highest level of service, which continues to be a competitive advantage. And in a dynamic ag market like we're experiencing, we provide even more differentiation. Our new product ramp-up of the optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuse products along with Optimum AcreMax technology hybrids are on track contributing to our net price gains as customers increase their use of these higher-value and used products. 
In soybeans, the USDA is forecasting lower acres year-over-year, and despite this fact, we'll grow our soybean sales in 2012 continuing to lead the market rate base in the confidence that customers have in our disease packages and our overall product performance. In addition to executing our great North American sale season, we received regulatory approval for our Optimum AcreMax XTreme integrated and reduced refuge insect-protection product. Extreme has dual mode of action above- and below-ground insect control for expanded trade durability with a 5% integrated refuge. This year, we're preparing impact plot to demonstrate our Optimum AcreMax XTreme product, and we'll be selling it commercially in 2013. Online of AcreMax products gives us the range of product options we need to extend our position with the robust product lineup of integrated and reduced refuge products providing growers with added convenience. 
Turning to our European seed business. Increased corn sales reflect our ability as market leader to capture growth when presented with an early start to the season and timing differences favoring the first quarter. We've been making investments in our business operations both in research and production in Central and Eastern Europe, expanding our leadership position and accelerating our progress in this important growing region. Our leading market position confirms we're making the right growth investments places. And finally, our corn performance in the Brazil season was outstanding. corn crop, as you know, a smaller and value versus that of the summer season, but it continues to grow each year in both hectares and technology adaption and, therefore, value. From a product perspective, our Herculex I products are quickly penetrating our product lineup because of their excellent insect protection particularly against [indiscernible And to further extend  ability in our lineup, we'll be launching Optimum Insect Protection products, which offers dual-mode aboveground insect protection. Based on our strong business model, we anticipate building our early success in 2012 and delivering strong summer season performance later this year. 
Turning to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter of $929 million grew 7% with both volume and price gains. The results reflect particular strength in the insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The success of our Rynaxypyr supports our investment efforts quickly expand the franchise bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor's treatment to the market. As a status update, we're on-track for our second half 2012 introduction of Cyazypyr in Asia Pacific, and we'll be introducing Dermacor treatment in the Mexican core market. While the 2012 launches our small, the target is large, and we believe that franchise of insect control products derive from the same novel chemistry family will grow over $1 billion over the next few years. 
Looking ahead to second quarter for the Agriculture segment, we expect mid-teens percent sales growth in mid-single-digit earnings growth compared to the same period in previous year. This reflects strong business performance in the early start to the season which added about $0.03 per share to the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter. The seed business anticipate the strong finish to the North American and European planning seasons. Crop Protection expects very strong second quarter as farmers are incented to protect their crops and maximize the yield. Also considered in our updated outlook, our input cost increases in the seeds business currency headwinds and growth investments. In summary, the ag segment laid out many proof points by which to measure success in 2012, and we're well on-track or exceeding our commitments which include segment sales growth of the upper end or slightly above our long-term compound annual growth rate guidance of 8% to 10%. In seed, we targeted net price gains in seed between 5% and 10% as our customers validate our value propositions product-by-product. The ramp-up of our Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and refuge insect protection products, the regulatory approval of Optimum AcreMax XTreme and continued growth of our international businesses in corn, soybeans, sunflowers and canola. 
Turning to Crop Protection. We estimated the market will grow 4% to 6% and that our growth would outpace the market based on contribution from both volume and price gains. And from a product perspective, a continued expansion of Rynaxypyr in the registration approval in launches of sister products, Cyazypyr and Dermacor see treatment and finally the expansion of the novel action in delenda. Consistently delivering against our commitment is important. And with our strategies firmly in place, our new-product launches lined up, we believe achieving our growth objectives comes down to execution, and our teams continue to execute very well. 
Now turning to Slide 8, reviewing our Nutrition & Health segment which includes the health and protection, enablers and Solae businesses. Sales of $808 million were up $484 million with earnings of $83 million reflecting both the integration and positive cost energy benefit of the Danisco Specialty Food Ingredient acquisition. The results posted show progress on the segments versus our focus with then Solae, the mix and reach by growing the high-value specialty soy products in line with our business objectives, double-digit sales growth in specialty was offset by a decline in the soy commodity side. The quality of earnings is improving as we enrich the mix and drive productivity in our Solae operations. The second goal is aligned with driving our acquisition targets. Legacy Danisco businesses achieved price gains as they continue to deliver new applications in the arena of nutrition and functional food solutions, improved health and food protection. With respect to cost synergies, the quarter reflects progress delivering cost synergies and productivity gains leveraging DuPont operations and global sourcing capabilities as examples. This demonstrated performance gives us confidence that we're on-track to achieve our 2012 synergy goals. Pretax operating margin for de segment is 10%, up sequentially reflecting the progress we're making on our key goals. And moving to the outlook for the second quarter, we expect sales in the combined segment in the range of $820 million to $860 million with portfolio impact, as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth will be underpinned by higher sales and dross synergies offset in part by the material inflation. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen for the update for the remainder of the segments."

Segment sales of $677 million decreased 17% on lower volumes. Price was up 1% primarily due to metals pass-through. While sales were down in Asia and Europe on a year-over-year basis, we saw Solae photovoltaic module inventory starting to normalize. Our PV sales were up sequentially as our newest Solamet offering are doing very well in the marketplace attracting much interest from Tier 1 producers. 
Turning to consumer electronics. Demand was mixed overall but particularly robust and tablet PCs and smartphone given recent new-product launches by our customers. PTOI of $33 million was down substantially, as expected, given the volume did fine and lower plant utilization experienced in the quarter. Looking to second quarter, we expect sales to be down moderately and PTOI down substantially versus very strong comps. On a sequential basis, we see sales up significantly and PTOI up substantially as photovoltaic and consumer electronics markets continued to improve. We continue to expect PV module installations to grow about 10% for the year with the strong demand for products like DuPont Solamet and Kevlar. 
Moving to Slide 10, we'll talk about Industrial Biosciences. Sales of $288 million and PTOI of $41 million were driven primarily by last year's Genencor acquisition with strong performance at our enzyme offering. This includes Extra xCP, our newest animal attrition product line, which is being very well-received in the poultry market place. Likewise, our enzymes for grain processing are gaining traction in Asia where high fructose corn syrup is not well-penetrated in the beverage market. For the second quarter, sales are expected to range between $290 million and $320 million as the year-over-year benefit due to acquisition comes to an end. PTOI margins will be low-double digits. We see continued growth in enzyme where our products are clearly differentiated based on our science, for example, in animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, on the biomaterials side, we see increasingly gaining adoption in carpeting. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were up 6% due to 16% higher price offsetting 10% lower volume. TiO2 demand was strongest in North America with Asia demand stabilizing and destocking coming to an end. Although TiO2 volume was down on the year-over-year bases, we saw sequential growth in all markets. Industrial chemical demand was favorable due to strong performance from aniline and cyanide. Overall, PTOI was up 30%, and strong pricing and our industry-leading productivity more than mitigated cost increases and lower volumes in those businesses. In the second quarter, we expect sales up modestly. Our leading indicators and demand signals adjust some improvement in demand for all major regions consistent with seasonality and general economic stabilization. PTOI is expected to be up moderately versus strong comp with an ongoing productivity focus. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 in Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased 6% due to higher selling prices in all regions and all market segment. OEM volume was up particularly in North America where auto builds increased by 17%, and that there is continued strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. Offsetting these increases was a decline in refinish volume primarily in Southern Europe resulting from uncertain macro conditions there. PTOI of $87 million increased 34% with 170 basis point margin expansion. This increases were the result of pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains partially offset by higher raw material cost. For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up slightly and earnings up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. Auto builds are forecast to be up 10% to 12% in the second quarter with full year global build is expected to be up 5% to 6%. This segment continues to implement pricing and mix enrichment actions while driving productivity gains that improve margins. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Sales were down 6% primarily due to 10% lower volume, partially offset by higher selling prices of 6%. Automotive-related demand improved particularly in North America. This was more than offset the continued softness in industrial and electronics market especially in Asia Pacific and Europe. Packaging markets remain stable. Although volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth versus fourth quarter. PTOI was down $48 million or about 17% on lower volume. For the second quarter, we expect sales down slightly with continued sequential growth. As a reminder, global auto builds are expected to grow 10% to 12%. Packaging demand will remain stable, and electronics and industrial markets are expected to improve sequentially but down versus prior year. PTOI is expected to be up moderately primarily due to lower ethane cost. On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 2% due to lower volume resuming from continued softness in  industrial markets partially offset by higher selling prices. PTOI was down $45 million or 31% principally due to lower volume and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar Cooper River plant. I'd like to note that customer qualifications that the new plant are proceeding as scheduled. For the second quarter, sales and PTOI are expected to be up slightly with continued improvement in North American demand. We see demand the movement for Kevlar as some of our newer products like Kevlar AP, Kevlar XP and Kevlar KM2+ for industrial holistic applications are being well-received in the market. These products utilize the new technology we've installed that our Cooper River plant. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement for Nomex particularly in the auto and energy solution market and entire backs for consumer applications. This concludes the segment updates and now I'll turn the call back Ellen."

With a couple of challenging quarters, but we're now seeing encouraging signs in our market. Destocking is adding in photovoltaics, consumer electronics and automotive plastics. Essentially all of our industrial businesses saw volume improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Now keep in mind that first and second quarters last year were extremely strong and make the tough year-over-year comps. We expect sequential volume again improvement in the second quarter. 
Moving to the regions. Asia demand is recovering from the slowdown that we saw in the fourth quarter with gradually movement throughout the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. While many European markets remained weak coupled with exceptions for Agriculture and certain auto exports. The good news is that we don't see conditions deteriorating for our industrial businesses. Jim spoke about the strong year we're delivering in Agriculture. You heard about the powerful combination of attracting pharma economics, strong product performance coming from rich R&D pipeline in seed and Crop Protection and an advantage to market in our seed business. And I would be remiss not to mention productivity was continue to be core to every business in DuPont. I'm particularly proud of our coating business, which had an unwavering focus of productivity in the last few years. Last year, the bottom line impact of productivity was by dramatically higher raw material costs and the coatings team took pricing actions during the second half of '11, made some tough portfolio decisions and never let up with productivity. So I'm very pleased to see the margin expansion this quarter of 170 basis points. And I look forward to the business gaining and further expanding those margins for the rest of the year. So in closing, it's about execution staying close to customers to understand underlying demand signals and anticipating an inflection point of demand like the ones we're seeing in photovoltaics. Delivering value to new products like our Optimum AcreMax family of corn hybrids or the pending launch of Rynaxypyr insecticides, jointly developing new product applications, so a very localized basis for our innovation centers and delivering on our productivity targets. We are well-positioned for continued recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint, and we remain confident in meeting our target and delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders.

Photovoltaics, we're looking at with everybody believes to be about 10% increase in global installs this year. Inventories were about half of what they were in the third and fourth quarter. And we're seeing things like the Solamet taste volume increase. Now part of that is due to our innovation and our new product PV17A, which is really being consumed in great quantities by the solar manufacturers. It's is just tremendous from an efficiency standpoint. Part of it is recovery. And so when we see that happens, destocking ending in the second quarter and coming up to about 10% the year. So I think what we see there is the progression. Now if you look at DTT, again, we see sequential month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter improvement in volumes around the globe. That comes from a variety of different industry, not only construction but also in industrial and plastics and things like that. And if you look at auto, I think that's going to be in Q1 this year. It was up 4% in the first quarter, but it was hugely different by country. The U.S., in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter was up some 17%, but China was down 4%. Now overall, the second quarter, we see China is going to be up tremendously. And one of those numbers and within globally second quarter looks like it's north of 10% growth in the second quarter for automotive. So I think as we take a look at the quarterly progression in the industry, as we take a look at what we're seeing is some of the product that kind of go in on the front-end like the production of this cell, that we're feeling very much both sequentially improvement will continue as far as we can see out into the future."

DuPont delivered strong results in the first quarter in line with our expectation at a time when markets were mixed. 
Sales were up 12%, with 5% organic growth and 7% from acquisitions. We had excellent price performance in the quarter, driven in part by new product introductions, which were up more than 50% versus prior year. Not surprisingly, Pioneer had one of the largest year-over-year increases in its area. Productivity projects are tracking well across our businesses. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with very sharp execution, drove double-digit growth in sales and operating income this quarter. 
With respect to key markets, Agriculture is strong, with favorable farmer economics, increased corn acres in Europe and North America and outstanding momentum from our business in 2011 carrying into this year. Global auto builds were up 4% in the quarter, with North America builds up 17% according to the third-party market data that we used. 
In photovoltaics, we expect destocking to end in the second quarter, and the industry will resume a more balanced production schedule. Consumer electronics is improving, and growth is very much a function of new application introductions, such as next-generation smartphones and tablets. 
For industrial markets, our Performance Chemical, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection segment volumes were down versus very strong comps in the prior year. Sequentially, volumes improved even when adjusting for seasonality while indicating -- I think this indicates a positive shift in momentum, and we anticipate these segments will return to year-over-year volume growth within the next 1 to 2 quarters. 
We continue to win in our markets through innovation. Our customers are benefiting from DuPont's valuable and meaningful product differentiation that enables them to serve their own end markets better. 
Here are just a couple of examples of DuPont's latest value-added innovations: an expanded offering of Optimum AcreMax insect-resistant corn hybrids for our farmers this season; and a next-generation metallized paste that improves efficiency of a solar module. And we've had overwhelming response to our recent introduction of Solamet PV17. 
I was in India last month and met with several customers, and I also had the chance to tour our research and development laboratories in Hyderabad and the newest DuPont innovation center in Pune. Like our other innovation centers, this one engages our customers and allows our teams to truly engage in meaningful product and design opportunities to help differentiate them in their markets. And in turn, DuPont's rewarded with a premium market position and greater customer loyalty. 
What you should take away from the first quarter is that we're off to a good start for the year. We expected slow sequential improvement, and that is what we're seeing. DuPont's well positioned in our markets, and we're executing with focus and discipline. Despite challenging conditions in certain markets, we delivered 12% growth in operating income this quarter. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter, and then I'll elaborate on my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"
268053,183072205,285721,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61.

DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Our strong performance reflects discipline and focus on innovation, productivity and differential management in spite of volatile macro conditions. 
I'd like to review the details of the quarter, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of sales and earnings results. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased over $250 million or 12%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, higher pension costs and a decrease in pharmaceuticals income. Excluding pharmaceuticals income, this is the 10th consecutive quarter that we've been able to deliver double-digit increases, and this outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio. 
Underlying earnings of $1.61 per share increased 6% compared to $1.52 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.10 of headwinds relating to taxes and exchange gains and losses. Consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion were up 12% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 8%, with increases in all regions and all segments, reflecting our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added another 7% to sales. 
Volume was down 2% from the near peak level in the first quarter of 2011. This decline is consistent with the market environment that Ellen just described. Sequentially, volumes improved, indicating a positive shift in momentum as we head into the second quarter. An example of this is in China, where volumes grew each month during the first quarter. Even with the Chinese Lunar New Year, volumes were up approximately 10% versus the fourth quarter, and we expect this positive trend to continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's turn into a corporate view of the first quarter, looking at EPS analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.45 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, this was the ninth consecutive quarter in which we successfully implemented price increases on a year-over-year basis. Excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes, first quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 7% versus last year's first quarter. 
These cost increases have moderated from the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 3% versus our previous assumptions of 4%. The one percentage point improvement is primarily a result of lower natural gas and ethane cost, along with a more advantageous mix of ores in our titanium dioxide business. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.01 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.20 per share, excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes. This was mainly driven by actions in the first quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, higher cost associated with operating our annual Kevlar plant at Cooper River and TiO2 capacity expansions, as well as R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at a time when existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration in the marketplace. I'd also like to note that the $0.20 includes a $0.04 higher non-cash pension cost. 
Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we delivered approximately $100 million of fixed cost productivity in the first quarter. We're well on our way to delivering against our commitment of $300 million for the full year. Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for the full year. For the second quarter, the stronger dollar is anticipated to be about an $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a $0.07 benefit. Although this does primarily reflect the acquisition of Danisco, it also includes a couple of smaller divestitures and acquisitions that were made to further enhance the strength of our portfolio. Speaking of Danisco, I want to just take a moment to give a quick update on how pleased I am with the status of the integration. We continue to make excellent progress with respect to the cost and revenue synergies that we had targeted, and I always knew that Danisco had exceptional science capabilities. However, I recently had the chance to see this firsthand when I visited Genencor's R&D facility in Palo Alto. And let me say, I came away very impressed with the facility, the energy of the scientists and the projects that are currently being developed within the R&D pipeline. After that visit, I have become even more enthusiastic about the potential of the combined businesses and the innovations that we can expect in the future. 
Turning back to the waterfall chart, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal is to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, there was volatility in exchange rates, coupled with the cost of coverage, which create a reduction in earnings during the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the exact impact that our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax on the EPS waterfall was a $0.06 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter of 23.9% versus 21.3% last year. As expected, the increase in the base tax rate primarily reflects an increase proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of R&D and other tax credits which expired at the end of 2011. We continue to expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be 23%. 
Lastly, other on the waterfall shows a negative $0.06 variance, including a $0.02 headwind from reduced pharmaceutical royalties. First quarter pharma income of $27 million was in line with our expectations, and we're still estimating full year 2012 pharma income to be about $50 million, which represents about a $240 million decline from 2011. 
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 15% in the first quarter led by growth in Agriculture. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $2.2 billion versus an outflow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This change was primarily due to the $500 million cash contribution to the U.S. principal pension plan that was made in January of this year. 
At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis first quarter '11, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 5 percentage points, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity for the full year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that. 
Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. We paid our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Additionally, in the first quarter, the company initiated a $400 million share repurchase program, which will be completed no later than May. This program begins to tap into the $2 billion share repurchase plan that was approved by the board last year. 
In summary, for the first quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one and played out as we had expected. Global volume for the company declined on a year-over-year bases but improved sequentially. In spite of challenging market conditions, we delivered double-digit increases in underlying total segment PTOI, which is a testament to our portfolio diversity, pricing discipline and productivity focus. 
Turning now to the second quarter. We expect a strong finish to the northern hemisphere planting season. Additionally, we expect the sequential volume growth we experienced in the first quarter to continue, particularly in PV, consumer electronics, TiO2 and automotive markets. Jim and Karen will provide more details when they cover the individual segments. 
For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, excluding significant items. The midpoint of our full year earnings guidance suggest we will grow earnings by 12% over the remaining 3 quarters, and we are well positioned to do just that. We continue to expect slow sequential movement against a backdrop of dynamic markets. The businesses affected by these dynamic conditions are taking actions in a variety of ways to mitigate the effects, including reducing expenditures and tightly managing cash. 
Our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to changing demand signals and to continue to service those customer needs. We remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in the business plans and in our ability to execute against those plans. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jim to review the Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. Jim?"

The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics. Our teams delivered growth in every region around the world as our footprint continues to expand at an impressive pace. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that sales grew 16% to $4.1 billion, with 8% price and 8% volume gains. Earnings were up 18% to $1.3 billion on higher volume and prices, more than offsetting the input cost increases, unfavorable currency impact and continued growth investments. 
Starting with seed sales, first quarter reached $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Corn sales growth in North America was the leading contributor, coupled with impressive results from an early strong start in Europe and robust Brazil Safrinha corn season sales. Specifically in North America, our direct sales teams are working closely with our customers to ensure the highest level of service, which continues to be a competitive advantage. And in a dynamic ag market like we're experiencing, it provides even more differentiation. Our new product ramp-ups of the Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge products, along with Optimum AQUAmax technology hybrids, are on track, contributing to our net price gains as customers increase their use of these higher value and used products. 
In soybeans, the USDA is forecasting lower acres year-over-year. And despite this fact, we'll grow our soybean sales in 2012, continuing to lead the market rate based on the confidence that customers have in our disease packages and our overall product performance. 
In addition to executing our great North American sales season, we received regulatory approval for our Optimum AcreMax XTreme integrated and reduced refuge insect-protection product. XTreme has dual med action above- and below-ground insect control for extended trade durability, with a 5% integrated refuge. This year, we're preparing IMPACT Plots to demonstrate our Optimum AcreMax XTreme product, and we'll be selling it commercially in 2013. Our line of AcreMax products gives us the range of product options we need to extend our position with a robust product lineup of integrated and reduced refuge products providing growers with added convenience. 
Turning to our European seed business, increased corn sales reflect our ability as market leader to capture growth when presented with an early start to the season and timing differences favoring the first quarter. We've been making investments in our business operations, both in research and production in Central and Eastern Europe, extending our leadership position and accelerating our progress in this important growing region. Our leading market position confirms we're making the right growth investment choices. 
And finally, our corn performance in the Brazil Safrinha season was outstanding. Safrinha corn crop, as you know, is smaller in value versus that of the summer season, but it continues to grow each year in both hectares and technology adoption and therefore, value. From a product perspective, our Herculex I products are quickly penetrating our product lineup because of their excellent insect protection, particularly against fall armyworm. 
And to further extend trade durability in our lineup, we'll be launching Optimum Intrasect insect protection products, which offers dual-mode above-ground insect protection. Based on our strong business model, we anticipate building our early success in 2012 and delivering strong summer season performance later this year. 
Turning to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter of $929 million grew 7%, with both volume and price gains. The results reflect particular strength in the insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The success of our Rynaxypyr supports our investment efforts quickly expand the franchise bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatments to the market. 
As a status update, we're on track for a second half 2012 introduction of Cyazypyr in Asia Pacific, and we'll be introducing Dermacor seed treatment in the Mexican core market. While the 2012 launches are small, the target is large, and we believe the franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry family will grow to $1 billion over the next few years. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter for the Agriculture segment, we expect mid-teens percent sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth compared to the same period's previous year. This reflects strong business performance in the early start to the season, which added about $0.03 per share to the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter. 
The seed business anticipate a strong finish to the North American and European planting seasons. Crop Protection expects a very strong second quarter as farmers are incented to protect their crops and maximize their yield. Also considered in our updated outlook are input cost increases in the seed business, currency headwinds and growth investments. 
In summary, the ag segment laid out many proof points by which to measure success in 2012, and we're well on track or exceeding our commitments, which include segment sales growth at the upper end or slightly above our long-term compound annual growth rate guidance of 8% to 10%. 
In seed, we targeted net price gains in seed between 5% and 10% as our customers validate our value propositions product-by-product. The ramp-up of our Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge insect protection products, the regulatory approval of Optimum AcreMax XTreme and continued growth of our international businesses in corn, soybeans, sunflowers and canola. 
Turning to Crop Protection, we estimate that the market will grow 4% to 6%, and that our growth would outpace the market based on contribution from both volume and price gains and from a product perspective, a continued expansion of Rynaxypyr and the registration approvals and launches of sister products, Cyazypyr and Dermacor seed treatment and finally, the expansion of a novel weed control mode of action into land management. Consistently delivering against our commitment is important. And with our strategies firmly in place, our new product launches lined up, we believe achieving our growth objectives comes down to execution, and our teams continue to execute very well. 
Now turning to Slide 8, reviewing our Nutrition & Health segment, which includes the health and protection, enablers and Solae businesses. Sales of $808 million were up $484 million, with earnings of $83 million reflecting both the integration and positive cost synergy benefit of the Danisco Specialty Food Ingredient acquisition. The results posted show progress on the segments key goals. 
First is our focus within Solae, the mix and reach, by growing the high-value specialty soy products. In line with our business objectives, double-digit sales growth in specialty was offset by a decline in the soy commodity side. The quality of earnings is improving as we enrich the mix and drive productivity in our Solae operations. 
The second goal is aligned with driving our acquisition targets. Legacy Danisco businesses achieved price gains as they continued to deliver new applications in the arena of nutrition and functional food solutions, improved health and food protection. With respect to cost synergies, the quarter reflects progress, delivering cost synergies and productivity gains, leveraging DuPont operations and global sourcing capabilities as examples. This demonstrated performance gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our 2012 synergy goals. 
Pretax operating margin for the segment hit 10%, up sequentially, reflecting the progress we're making on our key goals. And moving to the outlook for the second quarter, we expect sales in the combined segment in the range of $820 million to $860 million, with portfolio impact, as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth will be underpinned by higher sales and cost synergies offset in part by raw material inflation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen for an update on the remainder of the segments."

Segment sales of $677 million decreased 17% on lower volumes. Price was up 1%, primarily due to metals pass-through. While sales were down in Asia and Europe on a year-over-year basis, we saw photovoltaic module inventory starting to normalize. Our PV sales were up sequentially as our newest Solamet offering are doing very well in the marketplace, attracting much interest from Tier 1 producers. 
Turning to consumer electronics, demand was mixed overall but particularly robust in tablet PCs and smartphone, given recent new product launches by our customers. PTOI of $33 million was down substantially as expected, given the volume declines and lower plant utilization experienced in the quarter. Looking to second quarter, we expect sales to be down moderately and PTOI down substantially versus very strong comps. 
On a sequential basis, we see sales up significantly and PTOI up substantially as photovoltaic and consumer electronics markets continue to improve. We continue to expect PV module installations to grow about 10% for the year, with strong demand for products like DuPont Solamet and Tedlar. 
Moving to Slide 10, we'll talk about Industrial Biosciences. Sales of $288 million and PTOI of $41 million were driven primarily by last year's Genencor acquisition, with strong performance in our enzymes offering. This includes Axtra XAP, our newest animal nutrition product line, which is being very well received in the poultry market place. Likewise, our enzymes for grain processing are gaining traction in Asia, where high fructose corn syrup is not well-penetrated in the beverage market. 
For the second quarter, sales are expected to range between $290 million and $320 million as the year-over-year benefit due to acquisition comes to an end. PTOI margins will be low-double digits. We see continued growth in enzymes, where our products are clearly differentiated based on our science, for example, in animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, on the biomaterial side, we see Sorona increasingly gaining adoption in carpeting. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were up 6% due to 16% higher price offsetting 10% lower volume. TiO2 demand was strongest in North America, with Asia demand stabilizing and destocking coming to an end. Although TiO2 volume was down on a year-over-year bases, we saw sequential growth in all markets. Industrial chemical demand was favorable due to strong performance from aniline and cyanide. Overall, PTOI was up 30% as strong pricing and our industry-leading productivity more than mitigated cost increases and lower volumes in both businesses. 
In the second quarter, we expect sales up modestly. Our leading indicators and demand signal suggest some improvement in demand for all major regions consistent with seasonality and general economic stabilization. PTOI is expected to be up moderately versus strong comps with an ongoing productivity focus. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased 6% due to higher selling prices in all regions and all market segment. OEM volume was up, particularly in North America where auto builds increased by 17%, and there was continued strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. Offsetting these increases was a decline in refinish volume, primarily in Southern Europe, resulting from uncertain macro conditions there. 
PTOI of $87 million increased 34% with 170 basis point margin expansion. These increases were the result of pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains partially offset by higher raw material cost. 
For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up slightly and earnings up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. Auto builds are forecast to be up 10% to 12% in the second quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up 5% to 6%. This segment continues to implement pricing and mix enrichment actions while driving productivity gains that improve margins. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Sales were down 6%, primarily due to 10% lower volume, partially offset by higher selling prices of 6%. Automotive-related demand improved, particularly in North America. This was more than offset the continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe. 
Packaging markets remain stable. Although volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth versus fourth quarter. PTOI was down $48 million or about 17% on lower volume. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales down slightly with continued sequential growth. As a reminder, global auto builds are expected to grow 10% to 12%. Packaging demand will remain stable, and electronics and industrial markets are expected to improve sequentially but down versus prior year. PTOI is expected to be up moderately, primarily due to lower ethane costs. 
On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 2% due to lower volume resulting from continued softness in  industrial markets, partially offset by higher selling prices. PTOI was down $45 million or 31%, principally due to lower volume and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar Cooper River plant. I would like to note that customer qualifications at the new plant are proceeding as scheduled. 
For the second quarter, sales and PTOI are expected to be up slightly with continued improvement in North American demand. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, like Kevlar AP, Kevlar XP and Kevlar KM2 Plus, for industrial and ballistic applications are being well received in the market. These products utilize the new technology we've installed at our Cooper River plant. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement for Nomex, particularly in the auto and energy solution markets, and in Tyvek for consumer applications. 
This concludes the segment updates, and now I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

As Nick stated, today, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of $4.20 $4.40 per share or 7% to 12% growth.

As Nick stated, today, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of $4.20 $4.40 per share or 7% to 12% growth. We've had a couple of challenging quarters, but we're now seeing encouraging signs in our markets. Destocking is ending in photovoltaics, consumer electronics and automotive plastics. Essentially, all of our industrial businesses saw volume improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Now keep in mind that first and second quarters last year were extremely strong and make the tough year-over-year comps. We expect sequential volume again improvement in the second quarter. 
Moving to the regions. Asia demand is recovering from the slowdown that we saw in the fourth quarter with gradually movement throughout the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. While many European markets remain weak, a couple of exceptions are Agriculture and certain auto exports. The good news is that we don't see conditions deteriorating for our industrial businesses. Jim spoke about the strong year we're delivering in Agriculture. You've heard about the powerful combination of attractive farmer economics, strong product performance coming from rich R&D pipeline in seeds and Crop Protection and an advantages route-to-market in our seed business. 
And I would be remiss not to mention productivity, which continues to be core to every business in DuPont. And I'm particularly proud of our Coatings business, which had, had an unwavering focus on productivity over the last few years. Last year, the bottom line impact of productivity was matched by a dramatically higher raw material cost. And the coatings team took pricing actions during the second half of '11, made some tough portfolio decisions and never let up with productivity. So I'm very pleased to see the margin expansion this quarter of 170 basis points, and I look forward to the business gaining and further expanding those margins through the rest of the year. 
So in closing, it's about execution, staying close to customers to understand underlying demand signals and anticipating an inflection point in demand like the ones we're seeing in photovoltaics; delivering value through new products, like our Optimum AcreMax family of corn hybrids, or the pending launch of Cyazypyr insecticides; currently developing new product applications on a very localized basis for our innovation centers; and delivering on our productivity targets. We are well positioned for continued recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint, and we remain confident in meeting our targets and delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. 
So Karen, back to you."

But we, obviously, as you pointed out, have got a strong start to the year. As far as the Evonik situation goes, we don't have a drop-in product. So there would need to be work done, either in Delrin or Zytel, depending on which of the polymers would be relevant to the application. And that's why we've got our application development people and our sales people out with each of the OEMs that are impacted to really understand if we can help out.

In photovoltaics, we're looking at what everybody believes to be about a 10% increase in global installs this year. Inventories were at about 1/2 of what they were in the third and fourth quarter, and we're seeing things like the Solamet paste volume increase. Now part of that is due to our innovation and our new product, PV17A, which is really being consumed in great quantities by the solar manufacturers. It's just tremendous from an efficiency standpoint. Part of it is recovery. And so we see as that happens, destocking ending in the second quarter and coming at to about 10% the year. So I think what we see there is the progression. If you look at DTT, again, we see sequential month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter improvement in volumes around the globe. That comes from a variety of different industry, not only construction, but also in industrial and plastics and things like that. And if you look at auto, I think that's going to be at Q1 this year, it was up 4% in the first quarter, but it was hugely different by country. The U.S. in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter was up some 17%, but China was down 4%. Now overall, the second quarter, we see China is going to be up tremendously. And whether those numbers -- and we think globally, second quarter looks like it's north of 10% growth in the second quarter for automotive. So I think as we take a look at the quarterly progression of these industries, as we take a look at what we're seeing is some of our products that kind of go in on the front-end, like what the paste does on the production of a cell, that we're feeling very much like that sequentially improvement will continue as far as we can see out into the future."

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen."

DuPont delivered strong results in the first quarter in line with our expectations at a time when markets were mixed. 
Sales were up 12%, with 5% organic growth and 7% from acquisitions. We had excellent price performance in the quarter, driven in part by new product introductions, which were up more than 50% versus prior year. Not surprisingly, Pioneer had one of the largest year-over-year increases in its area. Productivity projects are tracking well across our businesses. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with very sharp execution, drove double-digit growth in sales and operating income this quarter. 
With respect to key markets, Agriculture is strong, with favorable farmer economics, increased corn acres in Europe and North America and outstanding momentum from our business in 2011 carrying into this year. Global auto builds were up 4% in the quarter, with North America builds up 17% according to the third-party market data that we used. 
In photovoltaics, we expect destocking to end in the second quarter, and the industry will resume a more balanced production schedule. Consumer electronics is improving, and growth is very much a function of new application introductions, such as next-generation smartphones and tablets. 
For industrial markets, our Performance Chemicals, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection segment volumes were down versus very strong comps in the prior year. Sequentially, volumes improved even when adjusting for seasonality now indicating -- I think this indicates a positive shift in momentum, and we anticipate these segments will return to year-over-year volume growth within the next 1 to 2 quarters. 
We continue to win in our markets through innovation. Our customers are benefiting from DuPont's valuable and meaningful product differentiation that enables them to serve their own end markets better. 
Here are just a couple of examples of DuPont's latest value-added innovations: an expanded offering of Optimum AcreMax insect-resistant corn hybrids for our farmers this season; and a next-generation metallized paste that improves efficiency of a solar module. And we've had overwhelming response to our recent introduction of Solamet PV17. 
I was in India last month and met with several customers, and I also had the chance to tour our research and development laboratories in Hyderabad and the newest DuPont innovation center in Pune. Like our other innovation centers, this one engages our customers and allows our teams to truly engage in meaningful product and design opportunities to help differentiate them in their markets. And in turn, DuPont's rewarded with a premium market position and greater customer loyalty. 
What you should take away from the first quarter is that we're off to a good start for the year. We expected slow sequential improvement, and that is what we're seeing. DuPont's well positioned in our markets, and we're executing with focus and discipline. Despite challenging conditions in certain markets, we delivered 12% growth in operating income this quarter. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Nick for more detail on the quarter, and then I'll elaborate on my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"
268053,183072205,285939,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61.

DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Our strong performance reflects discipline and focus on innovation, productivity and differential management in spite of volatile macro conditions. 
I'd like to review the details of the quarter, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of sales and earnings results. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased over $250 million or 12%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, higher pension costs and a decrease in pharmaceuticals income. Excluding pharmaceuticals income, this is the 10th consecutive quarter that we've been able to deliver double-digit increases, and this outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio. 
Underlying earnings of $1.61 per share increased 6% compared to $1.52 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.10 of headwinds relating to taxes and exchange gains and losses. Consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion were up 12% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 8%, with increases in all regions and all segments, reflecting our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added another 7% to sales. 
Volume was down 2% from the near peak level in the first quarter of 2011. This decline is consistent with the market environment that Ellen just described. Sequentially, volumes improved, indicating a positive shift in momentum as we head into the second quarter. An example of this is in China, where volumes grew each month during the first quarter. Even with the Chinese Lunar New Year, volumes were up approximately 10% versus the fourth quarter, and we expect this positive trend to continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the first quarter, looking at EPS analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.45 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, this was the ninth consecutive quarter in which we successfully implemented price increases on a year-over-year basis. Excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes, first quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 7% versus last year's first quarter. 
This cost increases have moderated from the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 3% versus our previous assumptions of 4%. The one percentage point improvement is primarily a result of lower natural gas and ethane cost, along with a more advantageous mix of ores in our titanium dioxide business. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.01 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.20 per share, excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes. This was mainly driven by actions in the first quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, higher cost associated with operating our annual Kevlar plant at Cooper River and TiO2 capacity expansions, as well as R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at the -- at a time when existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration in the marketplace. I'd also like to note that the $0.20 includes a $0.04 higher non-cash pension cost. 
Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we delivered approximately $100 million of fixed cost productivity in the first quarter. We're well on our way to delivering against our commitment of $300 million for the full year. Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for the full year. For the second quarter, the stronger dollar is anticipated to be about an $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a $0.07 benefit. Although this does primarily reflect the acquisition of Danisco, it also includes a couple of smaller divestitures and acquisitions that were made to further enhance the strength of our portfolio. Speaking of Danisco, I want to just take a moment to give a quick update on how pleased I am with the status of the integration. We continue to make excellent progress with respect to the cost and revenue synergies that we had targeted. And I always knew that Danisco had exceptional science capabilities. However, I recently had the chance to see this firsthand when I visited Genencor's R&D facility in Palo Alto. And let me say, I came away very impressed with the facility, the energy of the scientists and the projects that are currently being developed within the R&D pipeline. After that visit, I have become even more enthusiastic about the potential of the combined businesses and the innovations that we can expect in the future. 
Turning back to the waterfall chart, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal is to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, there was volatility in exchange rates, coupled with the cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings during the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the exact impact that our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax on the EPS waterfall was a $0.06 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter of 23.9% versus 21.3% last year. As expected, the increase in the base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of R&D and other tax credits which expired at the end of 2011. We continue to expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be 23%. 
Lastly, Other on the waterfall shows a negative $0.06 variance, including a $0.02 headwind from reduced pharmaceutical royalties. First quarter pharma income of $27 million was in line with our expectations, and we're still estimating full year 2012 pharma income to be about $50 million, which represents about a $240 million decline from 2011. 
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 15% in the first quarter led by growth in Agriculture. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $2.2 billion versus an outflow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This change was primarily due to the $500 million cash contribution to the U.S. principal pension plan that was made in January of this year. 
At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis first quarter '11, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 5 percentage points, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity for the full year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that. 
Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. We paid our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Additionally, in the first quarter, the company initiated a $400 million share repurchase program, which will be completed no later than May. This program begins to tap into the $2 billion share repurchase plan that was approved by the board last year. 
In summary, for the first quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one and played out as we had expected. Global volume for the company declined on a year-over-year basis but improved sequentially. In spite of challenging market conditions, we delivered double-digit increases in underlying total segment PTOI, which is a testament to our portfolio diversity, pricing discipline and productivity focus. 
Turning now to the second quarter. We expect a strong finish to the northern hemisphere planting season. Additionally, we expect the sequential volume growth we experienced in the first quarter to continue, particularly in PV, consumer electronics, TiO2 and automotive markets. Jim and Karen will provide more details when they cover the individual segments. 
For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, excluding significant items. The midpoint of our full year earnings guidance suggest we will grow earnings by 12% over the remaining 3 quarters, and we are well positioned to do just that. We continue to expect slow sequential movement against a backdrop of dynamic markets. The businesses affected by these dynamic conditions are taking actions in a variety of ways to mitigate the effects, including reducing expenditures and tightly managing cash. 
Our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to changing demand signals and to continue to service those customer needs. We remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in the business plans and in our ability to execute against those plans. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jim to review the Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. Jim?"

The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics. Our teams delivered growth in every region around the world as our footprint continues",1278,"Thanks, Nick. The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics. Our teams delivered growth in every region around the world as our footprint continues to expand at an impressive pace. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that sales grew 16% to $4.1 billion, with 8% price and 8% volume gains. Earnings were up 18% to $1.3 billion on higher volume and prices, more than offsetting the input cost increases, unfavorable currency impact and continued growth investments. 
Starting with seed sales, first quarter reached $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Corn sales growth in North America was the leading contributor, coupled with impressive results from an early strong start in Europe and robust Brazil Safrinha corn season sales. Specifically in North America, our direct sales teams are working closely with our customers to ensure the highest level of service, which continues to be a competitive advantage. And in a dynamic ag market like we're experiencing, it provides even more differentiation. Our new product ramp-ups of the Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge products, along with Optimum AQUAmax technology hybrids, are on track, contributing to our net price gains as customers increase their use of these higher value end-use products. 
In soybeans, the USDA is forecasting lower acres year-over-year. And despite this fact, we'll grow our soybean sales in 2012, continuing to lead the market rate based on the confidence that customers have in our disease packages and our overall product performance. 
In addition to executing a great North American sales season, we received regulatory approval for our Optimum AcreMax XTreme integrated and reduced refuge insect-protection product. XTreme has dual mode of action above- and below-ground insect control for extended trade durability, with a 5% integrated refuge. This year, we're preparing IMPACT Plots that demonstrate our Optimum AcreMax XTreme product, and we'll be selling it commercially in 2013. Our line of AcreMax products gives us the range of product options we need to extend our position with a robust product lineup of integrated and reduced refuge products providing growers with added convenience. 
Turning to our European seed business, increased corn sales reflect our ability as market leader to capture growth when presented with an early start to the season and timing differences favoring the first quarter. We've been making investments in our business operations, both in research and production in Central and Eastern Europe, extending our leadership position and accelerating our progress in this important growing region. Our leading market position confirms we're making the right growth investment choices. 
And finally, our corn performance in the Brazil Safrinha season was outstanding. Safrinha corn crop, as you know, is smaller in value versus that of the summer season, but it continues to grow each year in both hectares and technology adoption and therefore, value. From a product perspective, our Herculex I products are quickly penetrating our product lineup because of their excellent insect protection, particularly against fall armyworm. 
And to further extend trade durability in our lineup, we'll be launching Optimum Intrasect insect protection products, which offers dual-mode above-ground insect protection. Based on our strong business model, we anticipate building our early success in 2012 and delivering strong summer season performance later this year. 
Turning to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter of $929 million grew 7%, with both volume and price gains. The results reflect particular strength in the insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The success of Rynaxypyr supports our investment efforts to quickly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatments to the market. 
As a status update, we're on track for a second half 2012 introduction of Cyazypyr in Asia Pacific, and we'll be introducing Dermacor seed treatment in the Mexican core market. While the 2012 launches are small, the target is large, and we believe the franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry family will grow to $1 billion over the next few years. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter for the Agriculture segment, we expect mid-teens percent sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth compared to the same period's previous year. This reflects strong business performance in the early start to the season, which added about $0.03 per share to the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter. 
The seed business anticipate a strong finish to the North American and European planting seasons. Crop Protection expects a very strong second quarter as farmers are incented to protect their crops and maximize their yield. Also considered in our updated outlook are input cost increases in the seed business, currency headwinds and growth investments. 
In summary, the ag segment laid out many proof points by which to measure success in 2012, and we're well on track or exceeding our commitments, which include segment sales growth at the upper end or slightly above our long-term compound annual growth rate guidance of 8% to 10%. 
In seed, we targeted net price gains in seed between 5% and 10% as our customers validate our value propositions product by product. The ramp-up of our Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge insect protection products, the regulatory approval of Optimum AcreMax XTreme and continued growth of our international businesses in corn, soybeans, sunflowers and canola. 
Turning to Crop Protection, we estimated the market would grow 4% to 6%, and that our growth would outpace the market based on contribution from both volume and price gains and from a product perspective, the continued expansion of Rynaxypyr and the registration approvals and launches of sister products, Cyazypyr and Dermacor seed treatment and finally, the expansion of a novel weed control mode of action into land management. Consistently delivering against our commitments is important. And with our strategies firmly in place, our new product launches lined up, we believe achieving our growth objectives comes down to execution, and our teams continue to execute very well. 
Now turning to Slide 8, reviewing our Nutrition & Health segment, which includes the Health and Protection, Enablers and Solae businesses. Sales of $808 million were up $484 million, with earnings of $83 million reflecting both the integration and positive cost synergy benefit of the Danisco Specialty Food Ingredients acquisition. The results posted show progress on the segments' key goals. 
First is our focus within Solae, to mix enrich by growing the high-value specialty soy products. In line with our business objectives, double-digit sales growth in specialty was offset by a decline in the soy commodity side. The quality of earnings is improving as we enrich the mix and drive productivity in our Solae operations. 
The second goal is aligned with driving our acquisition targets. Legacy Danisco businesses achieved price gains as they continued to deliver new applications in the arena of nutrition and functional food solutions, improved health and food protection. With respect to cost synergies, the quarter reflects progress delivering cost synergies and productivity gains: leveraging DuPont operations and global sourcing capabilities, as examples. This demonstrated performance gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our 2012 synergy goals. 
Pretax operating margin for the segment hit 10%, up sequentially, reflecting the progress we're making on our key goals. And moving to the outlook for the second quarter, we expect sales in the combined segment in the range of $820 million to $860 million, with portfolio impact, as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth will be underpinned by higher sales and cost synergies offset in part by raw material inflation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen for an update on the remainder of the segments."

Segment sales of $677 million decreased 17% on lower volumes. Price was up 1%, primarily due to metals pass-through. While sales were down in Asia and Europe on a year-over-year basis, we saw photovoltaic module inventories starting to normalize. Our PV sales were up sequentially as our newest Solamet offerings are doing very well in the marketplace, attracting much interest from Tier 1 producers. 
Turning to consumer electronics, demand was mixed overall but particularly robust in tablet PCs and smartphones, given recent new product launches by our customers. PTOI of $33 million was down substantially, as expected, given the volume declines and lower plant utilization experienced in the quarter. Looking to second quarter, we expect sales to be down moderately and PTOI down substantially versus very strong comps. 
On a sequential basis, we see sales up significantly and PTOI up substantially as photovoltaic and consumer electronics markets continue to improve. We continue to expect PV module installations to grow about 10% for the year, with strong demand for products like DuPont Solamet and Tedlar. 
Moving to Slide 10, we'll talk about Industrial Biosciences. Sales of $288 million and PTOI of $41 million were driven primarily by last year's Genencor acquisition, with strong performance in our enzymes offering. This includes Axtra XAP, our newest animal nutrition product line, which is being very well received in the poultry market place. Likewise, our enzymes for grain processing are gaining traction in Asia, where high fructose corn syrup is not well-penetrated in the beverage market. 
For the second quarter, sales are expected to range between $290 million and $320 million as the year-over-year benefit due to acquisition comes to an end. PTOI margins will be low-double digits. We see continued growth in enzymes, where our products are clearly differentiated based on our science, for example, in animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, on the biomaterial side, we see Sorona increasingly gaining adoption in carpeting. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were up 6% due to 16% higher price offsetting 10% lower volume. TiO2 demand was strongest in North America, with Asia demand stabilizing and destocking coming to an end. Although TiO2 volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth in all markets. Industrial chemicals demand was favorable due to strong performance from aniline and cyanide. Overall, PTOI was up 30% as strong pricing and our industry-leading productivity more than mitigated cost increases and lower volumes in both businesses. 
In the second quarter, we expect sales up modestly. Our leading indicators and demand signals suggest an improvement in demand for all major regions consistent with seasonality and general economic stabilization. PTOI is expected to be up moderately versus strong comps with an ongoing productivity focus. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased 6% due to higher selling prices in all regions and all market segments. OEM volume was up, particularly in North America where auto builds increased by 17%, and there was continued strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. Offsetting these increases was a decline in refinish volume, primarily in Southern Europe, resulting from uncertain macro conditions there. 
PTOI of $87 million increased 34% with 170 basis point margin expansion. These increases were the result of pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains partially offset by higher raw material cost. 
For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up slightly and earnings up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. Auto builds are forecast to be up 10% to 12% in the second quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up 5% to 6%. This segment continues to implement pricing and mix enrichment actions while driving productivity gains that improve margins. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Sales were down 6%, primarily due to 10% lower volume, partially offset by higher selling prices of 6%. Automotive-related demand improved, particularly in North America. This was more than offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe. 
Packaging markets remain stable. Although volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth versus fourth quarter. PTOI was down $48 million or about 17% on lower volume. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales down slightly with continued sequential growth. As a reminder, global auto builds are expected to grow 10% to 12%. Packaging demand will remain stable, and electronics and industrial markets are expected to improve sequentially but down versus prior year. PTOI is expected to be up moderately, primarily due to lower ethane costs. 
On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 2% due to lower volume resulting from continued softness in industrial markets, partially offset by higher selling prices. PTOI was down $45 million or 31%, principally due to lower volume and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar Cooper River plant. I would like to note that customer qualifications at the new plant are proceeding as scheduled. 
For the second quarter, sales and PTOI are expected to be up slightly with continued improvement in North American demand. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, like Kevlar AP, Kevlar XP and Kevlar KM2 Plus, for industrial and ballistic applications are being well received in the market. These products utilize the new technology we've installed at our Cooper River plant. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement for Nomex, particularly in the auto and energy solution markets, and in Tyvek for consumer applications. 
This concludes the segment updates, and I'll now turn the call back to Ellen."

As Nick stated, today we are reaffirming our full year guidance of $4.20 $4.40 per share or 7% to 12% growth. We've had a couple of challenging quarters, but we're now seeing encouraging signs in our markets. Destocking is ending in photovoltaics, consumer electronics and automotive plastics. Essentially, all of our industrial businesses saw volume improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Now keep in mind that first and second quarters last year were extremely strong and make for tough year-over-year comps. We expect sequential volume again improvement in the second quarter. 
Moving to the regions. Asia demand is recovering from the slowdown that we saw in the fourth quarter with gradually improvement throughout the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. While many European markets remain weak, a couple of exceptions are Agriculture and certain auto exports. The good news is that we don't see conditions deteriorating for our industrial businesses. Jim spoke about the strong year we're delivering in Agriculture. You've heard about the powerful combination of attractive farmer economics, strong product performance coming from rich R&D pipelines in seeds and Crop Protection and an advantage route-to-market in our seed business. 
And I would be remiss not to mention productivity, which continues to be core to every business in DuPont. And I'm particularly proud of our Coatings business, which has had an unwavering focus on productivity over the last few years. Last year, the bottom line impact of productivity was matched by a dramatically higher raw material cost. And the coatings team took pricing actions during the second half of '11, made some tough portfolio decisions and never let up on productivity. So I'm very pleased to see the margin expansion this quarter of 170 basis points, and I look forward to the business sustaining and further expanding those margins through the rest of the year. 
So in closing, it's about execution, staying close to customers to understand underlying demand signals and anticipating an inflection point in demand like the ones we're seeing in photovoltaics; delivering value through new products, like our Optimum AcreMax family of corn hybrids, or the pending launch of Cyazypyr insecticides; [indiscernible] developing new product applications on a very localized basis for our innovation centers; and delivering on our productivity targets. We are well positioned for continued recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint, and we remain confident in meeting our targets and delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. 
So Karen, back to you."

In photovoltaics, we're looking at what everybody believes to be about a 10% increase in global installs this year. Inventories were at about 1/2 of what they were in the third and fourth quarter, and we're seeing things like the Solamet paste volume increase. Now part of that is due to our innovation and our new product, PV17A, which is really being consumed in great quantities by solar manufacturers. It's just tremendous from an efficiency standpoint. Part of it is recovery. And so when we -- we see if that happens, destocking ending in the second quarter and coming out to about 10% a year. So I think what we see there is the progression. If you look at DTT, again, we see sequential month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter improvement in volumes around the globe. That comes from a variety of different industries. Not only construction, but also in industrial and plastics and things like that. And if you look at auto, I think that's going to be a key one this year, it was up 4% in the first quarter, but it was hugely different by country. The U.S. in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter was up some 17%, but China was down 4%. Now overall, the second quarter, we see China is going to be up tremendously. And whether those numbers -- and we think globally, second quarter looks like it's north of 10% growth in the second quarter for automotive. So I think as we take a look at the quarterly progression of these industries, as we take a look at what we're seeing in some of our products that kind of go in on the front-end, like the paste does on the production of a cell, that we're feeling very much like that slow sequential improvement will continue as far as we can see out into the future."

DuPont delivered strong results in the first quarter in line with our expectations at a time when markets were mixed. 
Sales were up 12%, with 5% organic growth and 7% from acquisitions. We had excellent price performance in the quarter, driven in part by new product introductions, which were up more than 50% versus prior year. Not surprisingly, Pioneer had one of the largest year-over-year increases in its area. Productivity projects are tracking well across our businesses. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with very sharp execution, drove double-digit growth in sales and operating income this quarter. 
With respect to key markets, Agriculture is strong, with favorable farmer economics, increased corn acres in Europe and North America and outstanding momentum from our business in 2011 carrying into this year. Global auto builds were up 4% in the quarter, with North America builds up 17% according to the third-party market data that we used. 
In photovoltaics, we expect destocking to end in the second quarter, and the industry will resume a more balanced production schedule. Consumer electronics is improving, and growth is very much a function of new application introductions, such as next-generation smartphones and tablets. 
For industrial markets, our Performance Chemicals, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection segment volumes were down versus very strong comps in the prior year. Sequentially, volumes improved even when adjusting for seasonality now indicating -- I think this indicates a positive shift in momentum, and we anticipate these segments will return to year-over-year volume growth within the next 1 to 2 quarters. 
We continue to win in our markets through innovation. Our customers are benefiting from DuPont's valuable and meaningful product differentiation that enables them to serve their own end markets better. 
Here are just a couple of examples of DuPont's latest value-added innovations: an expanded offering of Optimum AcreMax insect-resistant corn hybrids for our farmers this season; and a next-generation metallized paste that improves efficiency of a solar module. And we've had overwhelming response to our recent introduction of Solamet PV17. 
I was in India last month and met with several customers, and I also had the chance to tour our research and development laboratories in Hyderabad and the newest DuPont innovation center in Pune. Like our other innovation centers, this one engages our customers and allows our teams to truly engage in meaningful product and design opportunities to help differentiate them in their markets. And in turn, DuPont's rewarded with a premium market position and greater customer loyalty. 
What you should take away from the first quarter is that we're off to a good start for the year. We expected slow sequential improvement, and that is what we're seeing. DuPont's well positioned in our markets, and we're executing with focus and discipline. Despite challenging conditions in certain markets, we delivered 12% growth in operating income this quarter. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Nick for more detail on the quarter, and then I'll elaborate on my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?"
268053,183072205,286155,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61.

DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Our strong performance reflects discipline and focus on innovation, productivity and differential management in spite of volatile macro conditions. 
I'd like to review the details of the quarter, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of sales and earnings results. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased over $250 million or 12%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, higher pension costs and a decrease in pharmaceuticals income. Excluding pharmaceuticals income, this is the 10th consecutive quarter that we've been able to deliver double-digit increases, and this outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio. 
Underlying earnings of $1.61 per share increased 6% compared to $1.52 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.10 of headwinds relating to taxes and exchange gains and losses. Consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion were up 12% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 8%, with increases in all regions and all segments, reflecting our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added another 7% to sales. 
Volume was down 2% from the near peak level in the first quarter of 2011. This decline is consistent with the market environment that Ellen just described. Sequentially, volumes improved, indicating a positive shift in momentum as we head into the second quarter. An example of this is in China, where volumes grew each month during the first quarter. Even with the Chinese Lunar New Year, volumes were up approximately 10% versus the fourth quarter, and we expect this positive trend to continue into the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the first quarter, looking at EPS analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.45 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, this was the ninth consecutive quarter in which we successfully implemented price increases on a year-over-year basis. Excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes, first quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 7% versus last year's first quarter. 
This cost increases have moderated from the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 3% versus our previous assumptions of 4%. The one percentage point improvement is primarily a result of lower natural gas and ethane cost, along with a more advantageous mix of ores in our titanium dioxide business. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.01 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.20 per share, excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes. This was mainly driven by actions in the first quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, higher cost associated with operating our annual Kevlar plant at Cooper River and TiO2 capacity expansions, as well as R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at the -- at a time when existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration in the marketplace. I'd also like to note that the $0.20 includes a $0.04 higher non-cash pension cost. 
Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we delivered approximately $100 million of fixed cost productivity in the first quarter. We're well on our way to delivering against our commitment of $300 million for the full year. Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for the full year. For the second quarter, the stronger dollar is anticipated to be about an $0.08 headwind versus prior year. 
Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a $0.07 benefit. Although this does primarily reflect the acquisition of Danisco, it also includes a couple of smaller divestitures and acquisitions that were made to further enhance the strength of our portfolio. Speaking of Danisco, I want to just take a moment to give a quick update on how pleased I am with the status of the integration. We continue to make excellent progress with respect to the cost and revenue synergies that we had targeted. And I always knew that Danisco had exceptional science capabilities. However, I recently had the chance to see this firsthand when I visited Genencor's R&D facility in Palo Alto. And let me say, I came away very impressed with the facility, the energy of the scientists and the projects that are currently being developed within the R&D pipeline. After that visit, I have become even more enthusiastic about the potential of the combined businesses and the innovations that we can expect in the future. 
Turning back to the waterfall chart, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal is to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, there was volatility in exchange rates, coupled with the cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings during the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the exact impact that our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax on the EPS waterfall was a $0.06 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter of 23.9% versus 21.3% last year. As expected, the increase in the base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of R&D and other tax credits which expired at the end of 2011. We continue to expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be 23%. 
Lastly, Other on the waterfall shows a negative $0.06 variance, including a $0.02 headwind from reduced pharmaceutical royalties. First quarter pharma income of $27 million was in line with our expectations, and we're still estimating full year 2012 pharma income to be about $50 million, which represents about a $240 million decline from 2011. 
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 15% in the first quarter led by growth in Agriculture. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $2.2 billion versus an outflow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This change was primarily due to the $500 million cash contribution to the U.S. principal pension plan that was made in January of this year. 
At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis first quarter '11, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 5 percentage points, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity for the full year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that. 
Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. We paid our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Additionally, in the first quarter, the company initiated a $400 million share repurchase program, which will be completed no later than May. This program begins to tap into the $2 billion share repurchase plan that was approved by the board last year. 
In summary, for the first quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one and played out as we had expected. Global volume for the company declined on a year-over-year basis but improved sequentially. In spite of challenging market conditions, we delivered double-digit increases in underlying total segment PTOI, which is a testament to our portfolio diversity, pricing discipline and productivity focus. 
Turning now to the second quarter. We expect a strong finish to the northern hemisphere planting season. Additionally, we expect the sequential volume growth we experienced in the first quarter to continue, particularly in PV, consumer electronics, TiO2 and automotive markets. Jim and Karen will provide more details when they cover the individual segments. 
For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, excluding significant items. The midpoint of our full year earnings guidance suggest we will grow earnings by 12% over the remaining 3 quarters, and we are well positioned to do just that. We continue to expect slow sequential movement against a backdrop of dynamic markets. The businesses affected by these dynamic conditions are taking actions in a variety of ways to mitigate the effects, including reducing expenditures and tightly managing cash. 
Our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to changing demand signals and to continue to service those customer needs. We remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in the business plans and in our ability to execute against those plans. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jim to review the Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. Jim?"

The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics.

The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics. Our teams delivered growth in every region around the world as our footprint continues to expand at an impressive pace. 
On Slide 7, you'll see that sales grew 16% to $4.1 billion, with 8% price and 8% volume gains. Earnings were up 18% to $1.3 billion on higher volume and prices, more than offsetting the input cost increases, unfavorable currency impact and continued growth investments. 
Starting with seed sales, first quarter reached $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Corn sales growth in North America was the leading contributor, coupled with impressive results from an early strong start in Europe and robust Brazil Safrinha corn season sales. Specifically in North America, our direct sales teams are working closely with our customers to ensure the highest level of service, which continues to be a competitive advantage. And in a dynamic ag market like we're experiencing, it provides even more differentiation. Our new product ramp-ups of the Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge products, along with Optimum AQUAmax technology hybrids, are on track, contributing to our net price gains as customers increase their use of these higher value end-use products. 
In soybeans, the USDA is forecasting lower acres year-over-year. And despite this fact, we'll grow our soybean sales in 2012, continuing to lead the market rate based on the confidence that customers have in our disease packages and our overall product performance. 
In addition to executing a great North American sales season, we received regulatory approval for our Optimum AcreMax XTreme integrated and reduced refuge insect-protection product. XTreme has dual mode of action above- and below-ground insect control for extended trade durability, with a 5% integrated refuge. This year, we're preparing IMPACT Plots that demonstrate our Optimum AcreMax XTreme product, and we'll be selling it commercially in 2013. Our line of AcreMax products gives us the range of product options we need to extend our position with a robust product lineup of integrated and reduced refuge products providing growers with added convenience. 
Turning to our European seed business, increased corn sales reflect our ability as market leader to capture growth when presented with an early start to the season and timing differences favoring the first quarter. We've been making investments in our business operations, both in research and production in Central and Eastern Europe, extending our leadership position and accelerating our progress in this important growing region. Our leading market position confirms we're making the right growth investment choices. 
And finally, our corn performance in the Brazil Safrinha season was outstanding. Safrinha corn crop, as you know, is smaller in value versus that of the summer season, but it continues to grow each year in both hectares and technology adoption and therefore, value. From a product perspective, our Herculex I products are quickly penetrating our product lineup because of their excellent insect protection, particularly against fall armyworm. 
And to further extend trade durability in our lineup, we'll be launching Optimum Intrasect insect protection products, which offers dual-mode above-ground insect protection. Based on our strong business model, we anticipate building our early success in 2012 and delivering strong summer season performance later this year. 
Turning to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter of $929 million grew 7%, with both volume and price gains. The results reflect particular strength in the insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The success of Rynaxypyr supports our investment efforts to quickly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatments to the market. 
As a status update, we're on track for a second half 2012 introduction of Cyazypyr in Asia Pacific, and we'll be introducing Dermacor seed treatment in the Mexican core market. While the 2012 launches are small, the target is large, and we believe the franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry family will grow to $1 billion over the next few years. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter for the Agriculture segment, we expect mid-teens percent sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth compared to the same period's previous year. This reflects strong business performance in the early start to the season, which added about $0.03 per share to the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter. 
The seed business anticipate a strong finish to the North American and European planting seasons. Crop Protection expects a very strong second quarter as farmers are incented to protect their crops and maximize their yield. Also considered in our updated outlook are input cost increases in the seed business, currency headwinds and growth investments. 
In summary, the ag segment laid out many proof points by which to measure success in 2012, and we're well on track or exceeding our commitments, which include segment sales growth at the upper end or slightly above our long-term compound annual growth rate guidance of 8% to 10%. 
In seed, we targeted net price gains in seed between 5% and 10% as our customers validate our value propositions product by product. The ramp-up of our Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge insect protection products, the regulatory approval of Optimum AcreMax XTreme and continued growth of our international businesses in corn, soybeans, sunflowers and canola. 
Turning to Crop Protection, we estimated the market would grow 4% to 6%, and that our growth would outpace the market based on contribution from both volume and price gains and from a product perspective, the continued expansion of Rynaxypyr and the registration approvals and launches of sister products, Cyazypyr and Dermacor seed treatment and finally, the expansion of a novel weed control mode of action into land management. Consistently delivering against our commitments is important. And with our strategies firmly in place, our new product launches lined up, we believe achieving our growth objectives comes down to execution, and our teams continue to execute very well. 
Now turning to Slide 8, reviewing our Nutrition & Health segment, which includes the Health and Protection, Enablers and Solae businesses. Sales of $808 million were up $484 million, with earnings of $83 million reflecting both the integration and positive cost synergy benefit of the Danisco Specialty Food Ingredients acquisition. The results posted show progress on the segments' key goals. 
First is our focus within Solae, to mix enrich by growing the high-value specialty soy products. In line with our business objectives, double-digit sales growth in specialty was offset by a decline in the soy commodity side. The quality of earnings is improving as we enrich the mix and drive productivity in our Solae operations. 
The second goal is aligned with driving our acquisition targets. Legacy Danisco businesses achieved price gains as they continued to deliver new applications in the arena of nutrition and functional food solutions, improved health and food protection. With respect to cost synergies, the quarter reflects progress delivering cost synergies and productivity gains: leveraging DuPont operations and global sourcing capabilities, as examples. This demonstrated performance gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our 2012 synergy goals. 
Pretax operating margin for the segment hit 10%, up sequentially, reflecting the progress we're making on our key goals. And moving to the outlook for the second quarter, we expect sales in the combined segment in the range of $820 million to $860 million, with portfolio impact, as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth will be underpinned by higher sales and cost synergies offset in part by raw material inflation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen for an update on the remainder of the segments."

Segment sales of $677 million decreased 17% on lower volumes. Price was up 1%, primarily due to metals pass-through. While sales were down in Asia and Europe on a year-over-year basis, we saw photovoltaic module inventories starting to normalize. Our PV sales were up sequentially as our newest Solamet offerings are doing very well in the marketplace, attracting much interest from Tier 1 producers. 
Turning to consumer electronics, demand was mixed overall but particularly robust in tablet PCs and smartphones, given recent new product launches by our customers. PTOI of $33 million was down substantially, as expected, given the volume declines and lower plant utilization experienced in the quarter. Looking to second quarter, we expect sales to be down moderately and PTOI down substantially versus very strong comps. 
On a sequential basis, we see sales up significantly and PTOI up substantially as photovoltaic and consumer electronics markets continue to improve. We continue to expect PV module installations to grow about 10% for the year, with strong demand for products like DuPont Solamet and Tedlar. 
Moving to Slide 10, we'll talk about Industrial Biosciences. Sales of $288 million and PTOI of $41 million were driven primarily by last year's Genencor acquisition, with strong performance in our enzymes offering. This includes Axtra XAP, our newest animal nutrition product line, which is being very well received in the poultry market place. Likewise, our enzymes for grain processing are gaining traction in Asia, where high fructose corn syrup is not well-penetrated in the beverage market. 
For the second quarter, sales are expected to range between $290 million and $320 million as the year-over-year benefit due to acquisition comes to an end. PTOI margins will be low-double digits. We see continued growth in enzymes, where our products are clearly differentiated based on our science, for example, in animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, on the biomaterial side, we see Sorona increasingly gaining adoption in carpeting. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were up 6% due to 16% higher price offsetting 10% lower volume. TiO2 demand was strongest in North America, with Asia demand stabilizing and destocking coming to an end. Although TiO2 volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth in all markets. Industrial chemicals demand was favorable due to strong performance from aniline and cyanide. Overall, PTOI was up 30% as strong pricing and our industry-leading productivity more than mitigated cost increases and lower volumes in both businesses. 
In the second quarter, we expect sales up modestly. Our leading indicators and demand signals suggest an improvement in demand for all major regions consistent with seasonality and general economic stabilization. PTOI is expected to be up moderately versus strong comps with an ongoing productivity focus. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased 6% due to higher selling prices in all regions and all market segments. OEM volume was up, particularly in North America where auto builds increased by 17%, and there was continued strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. Offsetting these increases was a decline in refinish volume, primarily in Southern Europe, resulting from uncertain macro conditions there. 
PTOI of $87 million increased 34% with 170 basis point margin expansion. These increases were the result of pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains partially offset by higher raw material cost. 
For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up slightly and earnings up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. Auto builds are forecast to be up 10% to 12% in the second quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up 5% to 6%. This segment continues to implement pricing and mix enrichment actions while driving productivity gains that improve margins. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Sales were down 6%, primarily due to 10% lower volume, partially offset by higher selling prices of 6%. Automotive-related demand improved, particularly in North America. This was more than offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe. 
Packaging markets remain stable. Although volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth versus fourth quarter. PTOI was down $48 million or about 17% on lower volume. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales down slightly with continued sequential growth. As a reminder, global auto builds are expected to grow 10% to 12%. Packaging demand will remain stable, and electronics and industrial markets are expected to improve sequentially but down versus prior year. PTOI is expected to be up moderately, primarily due to lower ethane costs. 
On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 2% due to lower volume resulting from continued softness in industrial markets, partially offset by higher selling prices. PTOI was down $45 million or 31%, principally due to lower volume and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar Cooper River plant. I would like to note that customer qualifications at the new plant are proceeding as scheduled. 
For the second quarter, sales and PTOI are expected to be up slightly with continued improvement in North American demand. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, like Kevlar AP, Kevlar XP and Kevlar KM2 Plus, for industrial and ballistic applications are being well received in the market. These products utilize the new technology we've installed at our Cooper River plant. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement for Nomex, particularly in the auto and energy solution markets, and in Tyvek for consumer applications. 
This concludes the segment updates, and I'll now turn the call back to Ellen."

As Nick stated, today we are reaffirming our full year guidance of $4.20 $4.40 per share or 7% to 12% growth. We've had a couple of challenging quarters, but we're now seeing encouraging signs in our markets. Destocking is ending",425,"Great. Thank you, Karen. As Nick stated, today we are reaffirming our full year guidance of $4.20 $4.40 per share or 7% to 12% growth. We've had a couple of challenging quarters, but we're now seeing encouraging signs in our markets. Destocking is ending in photovoltaics, consumer electronics and automotive plastics. Essentially, all of our industrial businesses saw volume improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Now keep in mind that first and second quarters last year were extremely strong and make for tough year-over-year comps. We expect sequential volume again improvement in the second quarter. 
Moving to the regions. Asia demand is recovering from the slowdown that we saw in the fourth quarter with gradually improvement throughout the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. While many European markets remain weak, a couple of exceptions are Agriculture and certain auto exports. The good news is that we don't see conditions deteriorating for our industrial businesses. Jim spoke about the strong year we're delivering in Agriculture. You've heard about the powerful combination of attractive farmer economics, strong product performance coming from rich R&D pipelines in seeds and Crop Protection and an advantage route-to-market in our seed business. 
And I would be remiss not to mention productivity, which continues to be core to every business in DuPont. And I'm particularly proud of our Coatings business, which has had an unwavering focus on productivity over the last few years. Last year, the bottom line impact of productivity was matched by a dramatically higher raw material cost. And the coatings team took pricing actions during the second half of '11, made some tough portfolio decisions and never let up on productivity. So I'm very pleased to see the margin expansion this quarter of 170 basis points, and I look forward to the business sustaining and further expanding those margins through the rest of the year. 
So in closing, it's about execution, staying close to customers to understand underlying demand signals and anticipating an inflection point in demand like the ones we're seeing in photovoltaics; delivering value through new products, like our Optimum AcreMax family of corn hybrids, or the pending launch of Cyazypyr insecticides; [indiscernible] developing new product applications on a very localized basis for our innovation centers; and delivering on our productivity targets. We are well positioned for continued recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint, and we remain confident in meeting our targets and delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. 
So Karen, back to you."

But we, obviously, as you pointed out, have got a strong start to the year. As far as the Evonik situation goes, we don't have a drop-in product. So there would need to be work done, either in Delrin or Zytel, depending on which of the polymers would be relevant to the application. And that's why we've got our application development people and our sales people out with each of the OEMs that are impacted to really understand if we can help out.

In photovoltaics, we're looking at what everybody believes to be about a 10% increase in global installs this year. Inventories were at about 1/2 of what they were in the third and fourth quarter, and we're seeing things like the Solamet paste volume increase. Now part of that is due to our innovation and our new product, PV17A, which is really being consumed in great quantities by solar manufacturers. It's just tremendous from an efficiency standpoint. Part of it is recovery. And so when we -- we see if that happens, destocking ending in the second quarter and coming out to about 10% a year. So I think what we see there is the progression. If you look at DTT, again, we see sequential month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter improvement in volumes around the globe. That comes from a variety of different industries. Not only construction, but also in industrial and plastics and things like that. And if you look at auto, I think that's going to be a key one this year, it was up 4% in the first quarter, but it was hugely different by country. The U.S. in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter was up some 17%, but China was down 4%. Now overall, the second quarter, we see China is going to be up tremendously. And whether those numbers -- and we think globally, second quarter looks like it's north of 10% growth in the second quarter for automotive. So I think as we take a look at the quarterly progression of these industries, as we take a look at what we're seeing in some of our products that kind of go in on the front-end, like the paste does on the production of a cell, that we're feeling very much like that slow sequential improvement will continue as far as we can see out into the future."

This newly created reporting segment of Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences delivered strong performance this quarter and are expected to combine for over $4.5 billion in sales this year, with a pretax operating margin in the 10% to 14% range. We will deliver $130 million of cost synergies by year end and expect additional productivity and margin expansion in 2013 and beyond. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was the conclusion of the northern hemisphere planting season. For the first half, Ag segment results were up 15% and pretax operating income up 16% driven by new products, strong relationships with our growers and an ever-expanding global footprint. In addition to a strong foundation in North America, we have built solid businesses in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, which offer additional attractive growth. Earlier this quarter, we announced government approval of the acquisition of Company, a leader in Africa, as yet another example of our global build-out. 
Finally, I would remiss if I didn't highlight innovation milestones. We're tracking well versus our target of having 30% sales from new products introduced within the last 4 years. I'd like to give just one new product example from the quarter. Our Performance Polymers business responded quickly to address the global shortage of TA 12, a critical polymer for automotive applications. We accelerated the introduction of new grades of our Zytel product to allow the automotive industry to continue to produce parts with alternative materials. The contribution of business results is small in the quarter but importantly, we demonstrated again DuPont to be a valued partner in helping the auto industry respond to a critical shortage. 
Now I'll -- turn the call over to Nick and Karen to review the quarter in more detail. Then I'll come back and close out the call with our views on the outlook. So Nick?"
268053,183072798,329109,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3.

Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million or 9% overcoming headwinds relating to currency, a decrease in pharmaceutical income and higher pension costs. This outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio and moreover, the outstanding execution by our teams. Underlying earnings of $1.48 per share increased $0.11 compared to the $1.37 in the prior year, as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.06 of headwinds relating to exchange losses and taxes. 
Consolidated net sales of $11 billion were up 7% versus the prior year. Local selling prices increased 6% with gains in all regions and most segments, reflecting the benefits from new product introductions coupled with our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added 5% to sales. 
Volume was down 1% from the near-peak level in the second quarter 2011. On a sequential basis, when you exclude Ag and adjust for seasonality, volumes improved 3% led by Asia Pacific. We expect this momentum to continue as we head into the second half of the year, particularly in the photovoltaic, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. 
Now let's turn to our corporate view of the second quarter, looking at EPS variance analysis on Slide 4. Higher local selling prices resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit. Variable costs were a $0.03 headwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were up about 1% over the prior year. Input costs have moderated from the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 1% versus our previous assumption of 3%. The 2 percentage point improvement is primarily due to lower crude oil and ethane costs as well as more advantageous mixes of in our titanium dioxide business. The improvement also includes lower silver costs, which are passed through to the customer so there's no associated earnings impact. Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.06 per share.
Let's move to fixed costs, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share when you exclude currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects growth investments including increased R&D and marketing initiatives in the Ag segment and costs associated with operating the new Kevlar and Tedlar plans. I would also like to note that the fixed costs increase includes a $0.04 of higher noncash pension costs over prior year. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we've delivered approximately $190 million of fixed costs productivity year-to-date. We're well on our way to exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year.
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 variance in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.30 to $0.35 headwind for the full year, compared to our previous guidance of $0.20 to $0.25. For third quarter alone, the stronger dollar would result in about a $0.12 to $0.14 headwind versus prior year.  Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a net $0.06 benefit primarily reflecting the acquisition of Danisco. 
Moving on, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation on scheduled D in the earnings news release can be found. It shows the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax was a $0.02 headwind. This represents a difference between the base tax rates of 24.1% this quarter versus 23% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increase proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions as well as the absence of the R&D and other tax credits, which expired at the end of 2011. We now expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be about [ph] 24%, 1 percentage point higher than our previous guidance, which equates to an additional $0.05 per share headwind for the full year. This revision reflects our latest view on the earnings mix.
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We are now estimating full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million, an increase of $15 million versus our original guidance. With that change, we expect pharma to be $225 million less than it was in 2011. 
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. You can see we delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 11% in the second quarter led by growth in Agriculture.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was $0.4 billion, essentially flat versus the prior year. At the end of the second quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2011, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 4% when you exclude the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. 
Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. In April, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, and we paid our 431st consecutive quarterly dividend in last month. Additionally, we completed the repurchase of $400 million of shares in the month of May.
In summary, for the second quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Global volume for the company declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, but improved sequentially excluding Agriculture. As a result of our strong execution and portfolio diversity, we delivered a double-digit increase in the underlying total segment PTOI excluding pharma in -- in spite of this very challenging market conditions that we're facing. 
Turning now to the third quarter, we expect sequential volume growth to continue particularly in PV, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. Additionally, we expect volume growth on a year-over-year basis, albeit off of a easier comp. Karen will provide more details when she covers the individual segments.
For the full year, there are several items that we see as either headwinds or tailwinds. Weaker macros, a stronger dollar and higher tax rate are some of the headwinds. On the other hand, lower input cost will certainly be a tailwind. Taking these items into consideration, we expect full year earnings to be towards the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share excluding significant items. Additionally, we expect earnings in the second half of the year to be split about evenly between quarters 3 and quarters 4. 
Some of our businesses are impacted more from the changing macros than other businesses. However, each of our businesses has meaningful, externally benchmarked performance targets. These businesses that are not executing against their targets are being required to provide even more productivity gains. These businesses are taking actions in a variety of ways including reducing expenditures and tightly managing their cash. They are also shifting resources as new opportunities are identified. All of our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to changing demand and to continue to serve our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. 
Lastly, I would like to remind investors that although we are kicking actions to react to today's dynamic market conditions, we also remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing the top line 7% and earnings 12%. We continue to drive a disciplined process around innovation, productivity and differential management. We're committed to build on successes in developing markets, and we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of continuing to have a strong balance sheet. Our focus on these areas and our strong execution are the key enablers for our success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen who will review the segments. Karen?"

Turning to Slide 7, our Agriculture segment continued their momentum established in the first quarter, underpinned by strong northern hemisphere execution and a robust ag market. Sales of $3.4 billion grew 13% with roughly equal contribution from volume and price. Earnings grew 12% to $926 million. First half sales of $7.5 billion grew 15% with earnings up 16% to $2.2 billion. 
Reviewing the individual businesses starting with seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.5 billion, up 12% with first half sales growing to $5.7 billion, up 16%. While first half growth reflects increased corn and soybean acres and strong price performance in North America, each region contributed positive price and volume growth. As a result, the business is expected to be at the top end of our goal to deliver 5% to 10% net price gains this year. North American growers have recognized the value of our Optimum AcreMax family of reduced and integrated refuse solutions. This is only the second commercial season for this technology, and adoption rates continue to exceed our expectations. Over 70% of above- and below-ground sales and about 10% of above-ground-only sales were in AcreMax technology, which is at the high end of our expected range. Additionally, growers planted over 2 million acres of our Optimum AcreMax developed to deliver a yield advantage in a water-limited environment. 
In soybeans, we grew sales through pricing gains and volume growth in North America. Our focus has been optimizing the financial contribution of the breeding investment we made in soybeans. Through outstanding execution, we continue to lead the market based on the confidence customers have in our disease packages and all-around product performance.
Moving to Europe, cornfields in the quarter were down year-over-year as expected following an early start for this season, which favored the first quarter. For the first half, pricing and volume contributed positively to sales growth. 
In crop protection, second quarter sales grew $879 million, up 15% with first half sales of $1.8 billion up 11% led by volume growth in North America and Latin America. The results reflect growth up on all product categories with notable strength in insect controls product sales, as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The broad success of our Rynaxypyr supports our aggressive investment effort to rapidly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatment to the market. We received our first registration of Cyazypyr in Argentina on July 13, and we expect to launch in the second half. We expect this franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry will grow to over $1 billion in the next few years.
Looking ahead for the second half for the Agriculture segment, our outlook remains unchanged as we expect high-single-digit percentage sales growth and larger seasonal losses as compared to the same period previous year. Second half sales anticipate strong business performance in both seeds and crop protection in Latin America, partially offset by significant currency headwind primarily due to the rial and lower corn planting as growers in Argentina and Brazil are expected to move strongly to soybeans. Sales growth is offset by continued investment in our Right Product, Right Acre strategy, new product launches and long-term R&D build-out.
Moving to Slide 8 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $795 million were down 11% primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver price pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials was enhanced by our industry-leading product, like our latest paste, gaining traction with customers coupled with recovery from the inventory correction that began late last year. In consumer electronics, demand was up for our market-leading materials, driven by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. PTOI was down 27% on lower volume and plant utilization. Additionally in the prior year, PTOI was reduced $20 million due to extreme metals volatility. For the third quarter, we expect sales down slightly due to pass-through of lower metal prices and PTOI up slightly on higher volume. Sequentially, the story is even stronger with earnings up substantially due to continued momentum in PV and consumer electronics. Photovoltaics remained a very dynamic market. We see installations continuing strong in the U.S. and China, with new positive feed-in tariffs in Japan even as industry macros are weighing on the module makers. For the full year, we reaffirm our review of 10% growth in global installs, and our advanced materials will play an essential part in that.  On the consumer electronics side, launches of new mobile devices are expected to pull through our industry-leading materials like on black. 
Now on to slide 9, Industrial Biosciences. It delivered sales of $300 million with growth predominantly from acquisitions. In biomaterials, our Sorona polymer continues to gain market adoption, thanks to our highly differentiated value proposition. PTOI of $44 million grew primarily because of acquisition, but also from cost synergies which are performing in line with expectations.
Turning to third quarter, we see sales up modestly and PTOI up substantially with realization of additional cost synergies. As in previous quarters, the generally good market fundamentals for enzymes are expected to remain favorable, albeit with some slowing of enzymes for ethanol given higher corn prices.
Turning now to Slide 10 for Nutrition & Health. The team delivered a very strong performance in the quarter, posting sales of $885 million with earnings of $112 million. The quarter reflects the 2-month acquisition benefit in addition to growth in Solae. Our global teams have maintained the business momentum from our businesses, delivering pro forma sales growth in health and protection and enablers, with both price and volume gains that more than offset currency headwind. For Solae, a key growth objective is to enhance product mix and earnings by growing this Solae specialty segment while optimizing the commodity segment. Towards that goal, Solae specialty posted mid-teens sales growth as our new products continue to penetrate the nutrition solution and improved health segment of the food ingredients market. Pretax operating margin of 13% reflect the progress we're making on cost synergies with meaningful impact from timing lag on raw material costs inflation.
Moving to the outlook for third quarter. We expect moderate sales growth with substantial earnings growth. Year-over-year pretax operating margins will be up substantially, reflecting business mix and cost synergies, but will be tempered sequentially due to raw material inflation. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were essentially flat as higher prices offset lower volume. Versus a sold-out environment last year, TiO2 demand was down particularly in Europe and to a less extent, Asia; while North America showed strength. Within the quarter, we saw growing momentum particularly in Asia. As an example, China's June sales were our strongest year-to-date for TiO2. Strong demand in industrial chemicals like cyanide also provided an uplift to the quarter's result. PTOI of $538 million was up 7% despite higher ore costs, reflecting our technologically advantaged process and consistent gains in productivity. In third quarter, we expect sales down modestly and PTOI down substantially versus a very strong comp of TiO2 and robust product demand a year ago. In spite of the uncertain global macroenvironment, segment outlook is for a sequential improvement. Additionally, we reiterate our view of flat segment margins year-over-year for Performance Chemicals on slightly lower volume. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 in Performance Coatings. Higher OEM volume, tied to a 10% increase in auto builds, helped the quarter. These increases were more than offset by weaker refinish and power coatings volumes primarily in Europe resulting from weak macro conditions. PTOI increased 26% with 180 basis points margin expansion, which resulted from pricing and mix enrichment action plus productivity gains, partially offset by unfavorable currency.  For the third quarter, we expect segment sales to be essentially flat in spite of unfavorable currency. PTOI is expected to be up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. 
Now turning to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Automotive related demand continued to improve particularly in North America. This was offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Europe and Asia Pacific. However, we did see sequential growth in electronics in Asia. Additionally, packaging markets improved modestly. PTOI increased 25% primarily due to lower feedstock costs, higher volume, improved mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down modestly as the stronger volume will be offset by lower U.S. dollar selling prices primarily due to currency headwind. PTOI is expected to be up substantially on a stronger mix.
On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 4% primarily due to lower public sector demand and continued softness in industrial market. PTOI was down 11% on weaker mix, unfavorable currency and higher costs associated with operating a new Kevlar plant, partially offset by value-based pricing actions. For the third quarter, sales are expected to be up slightly with higher demand, principally in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by unfavorable currency. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, utilizing the latest technology installed in our new Cooper River plant, are being very well-received in the market. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement from Nomex from higher infrastructure spend and in local protection markets. PTOI is expected to be up modestly on stronger volume and improved fixed costs leverage, partially offset by unfavorable currency. 
That concludes our review of the segments. I'll now turn the call back over to Ellen."
268053,183072798,329109,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Karen.

Thank you, Karen. As Nick already stated, we expect full year earnings excluding significant items to be towards the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share due to the uncertainties of the global macro conditions, currency and anticipated higher tax rate due to earnings mix. Year-to-date, you've seen the strength and resiliency of our portfolio plus disciplined execution combine for earnings that were better than expected, and we intend to finish the year with the same discipline and focus. We remain committed to differentially manage our portfolio and invest in markets where growth remains attractive. For innovation centers an important tools in this , and there are places where we can focus resource and leverage the power of DuPont innovation in order to pursue growth opportunities and developing markets. 
As the result of a series of very purposeful actions, investment innovation, selected capacity expansion, acquisitions such as Danisco and just to name a few, our portfolio is less cyclical than it was just 5 years ago, and we continue to drive productivity and benefit from the restructuring actions we implemented in 2009. Our business teams remain close to the market and customers, ensuring that they are ready -- reading underlying demand signals from downstream markets and able to meet whatever changing customer needs they see. They're also focusing on innovation that truly add value to our customers and create opportunity for growth in new areas. 
Now I'd like to walk through some of the markets that are the most important to DuPont. Our Agriculture & Nutrition Health segments will contribute about 1/3 of the company's sales and earnings this year. Agriculture and specialty food ingredient markets are expanding based on population growth and the demand for healthier food choices. Our businesses drive solution to improve productivity and deliver more nutritious food. Success is contingent on our ability to continue to deliver products with improved performance for our customers year in and year out. And we have tremendous momentum with how customers have responded to our latest offering. 
TiO2 has received a lot of attention lately. The market became soft in the second half of '11 and we've seen slow sequential recoveries since then. We believe that recent comments in the press regarding demand outlook overstated the softness of the market, so much so in fact that we publicly affirmed our confidence in the demand outlook. We expect sequential recovery to continue. We expect segment margin for 2012 to be comparable to 2011, which is among the highest in our portfolio right now. Keep in mind that overall fundamentals in this market are robust. Demand historically track GDP growth, and we anticipate only modest capacity additions to this market over the next 4 years. We expect favorable market conditions to remain during that time frame.
Moving to automotive. Our expectation of global builds is still about 5% growth this year, although that outflow varied from a 6% decline in Europe to 14% growth in North America with the rest of the world somewhere in between. And finally, electronic markets are improving. Consumer electronics is bolstered by continued strong demand for smartphones and tablets. Demand for photovoltaic materials has shown good sequential improvement since the downturn in the second half of 2011, and we continue to expect PV installations to be up 10% over last year. Overall, with DuPont's mix of products sold into electronic markets, we expect sequential recovery to continue in the second half.
So to summarize, second quarter came in about as expected against the backdrop of a very dynamic market conditions. The company demonstrated strong execution and resiliency. The comments we've made about our performance and our outlook are very consistent with what we've been saying for the past couple of years. Innovation is the backbone of the company, and we differentiate ourselves through our offerings. We are prioritizing resources and aligning with secular growth opportunities in food, energy and protection and productivity. It remains a way of life for each and every of our businesses. These are our constants, the essential drivers of our performance that enable us to deliver increased value for our shareholders over time.

We're still very bullish on the mid-, long-term prospects for TiO2. When you look at the growth it has, relation to GDP, over the next 5 years, the only significant new capacity being announced is DuPont. And there just isn't enough capacity announced to keep up with the demand is that sort of GDP growth rates. So we're seeing basic fundamentals still intact moving forward, even if there is a short-term period of demand contraction. We're also seeing our strong position based on the decades of innovation we have, our #1 position around production capacity as well as our advantaged position from a manufacturing technology standpoint. You couple all those macros with some of the specifics that are going on right now. And you look at even with this volume being somewhat depressed, you look at the earnings of this business in the year and you look at the margins of this business. And you're still in line with what was performance was in last year's results. So you're seeing margins very much in line and earnings overall very much in line.

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont executed well in the quarter and delivered strong results despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continued our momentum with particularly robust volume growth in agriculture, food and enzyme markets",494,"Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont executed well in the quarter and delivered strong results despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continued our momentum with particularly robust volume growth in agriculture, food and enzyme markets. Company sales were up 7% despite a 3% currency headwind. Excluding currency, sales were up in all regions. Sales to developing markets grew 11% versus a very strong comp. While volumes were down in Europe and Asia, we continue to see sequential improvement on a seasonally adjusted basis. Volumes were up 5% and 3% in China and India, respectively, versus the second quarter of 2011, which is another measure of good momentum in the regions. Underlying earnings grew 8% to $1.48 per share.  On a segment level, pretax operating income was up 13% excluding Pharmaceuticals. 
I'd like to highlight some of the important milestones from the quarter. First, we passed the one-year anniversary of the Danisco acquisition in May. The contributions and benefit from the acquisition have exceeded our expectation. We added 2 very attractive businesses to our portfolio and identified significant opportunities for cost and revenue synergies. This newly created reporting segments of Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences delivered strong performance this quarter and are expected to combine for over $4.5 billion in sales this year with a pretax operating margin in the 10% to 14% range. We will deliver $130 million of cost synergies by year end and expect additional productivity and margin expansion in 2013 and beyond. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was the conclusion of the northern hemisphere planting season. For the first half, Ag segment results were up 15% and pretax operating income up 16% driven by new products, strong relationships with our growers and an ever-expanding global footprint. In addition to a strong foundation in North America, we have built solid businesses in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, which offer additional attractive growth. 
Earlier this quarter, we announced government approval of the acquisition of Pannar Seed company, a leader in Africa, as yet another example of our global build-out. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight innovation milestones. We're tracking well versus our target of having 30% sales from new products introduced within the last 4 years. I'd like to give just one new product example from the quarter. Our performance polymers business responded quickly to address the global shortage of PA-12, a critical polymer for automotive applications. We accelerated the introduction of new grades of our Zytel product to allow the automotive industry to continue to produce parts with alternative materials. The contribution to business results is small in the quarter, but importantly, we demonstrated, again, DuPont to be a valued partner in helping the auto industry respond to a critical shortage. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Nick and Karen to review the quarter in more detail. Then I'll come back and close out the call with our views on the outlook. So Nick?"
268053,183072798,329358,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million or 9%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, a decrease in pharmaceutical income and",1356,"Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. 
Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million or 9%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, a decrease in pharmaceutical income and higher pension costs. This outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio, and moreover, the outstanding execution by our teams. Underlying earnings of $1.48 per share increased $0.11 compared to the $1.37 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.06 of headwinds relating to exchange losses and taxes. 
Consolidated net sales of $11 billion were up 7% versus the prior year. Local selling prices increased 6% with gains in all regions and most segments, reflecting the benefits from new product introductions coupled with our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added 5% to sales. 
Volume was down 1% from the near-peak level in the second quarter 2011. On a sequential basis, when you exclude Ag and adjust for seasonality, volumes improved 3% led by Asia Pacific. We expect this momentum to continue as we head into the second half of the year, particularly in the photovoltaic, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. 
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter, looking at EPS variance analysis on Slide 4. Higher local selling prices resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit. Variable costs were a $0.03 headwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were up about 1% over the prior year. Input costs have moderated from the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 1% versus our previous assumption of 3%. The 2 percentage point improvement is primarily due to lower crude oil and ethane costs as well as more advantageous mixes of ores in our titanium dioxide business. The improvement also includes lower silver costs, which are passed through to the customers so there's no associated earnings impact. Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.06 per share.
Let's move to fixed costs, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share when you exclude currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects growth investments including increased R&D and marketing initiatives in the Ag segment and costs associated with operating the new Kevlar and Tedlar plans. I would also like to note that the fixed costs increase includes a $0.04 of higher noncash pension costs over prior year. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we've delivered approximately $190 million of fixed costs productivity year-to-date. We're well on our way toward exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year.
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 variance in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.30 to $0.35 headwind for the full year, compared to our previous guidance of $0.20 to $0.25. For third quarter alone, the stronger dollar would result in about a $0.12 to $0.14 headwind versus prior year.  
Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a net $0.06 benefit primarily reflecting the acquisition of Danisco. 
Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation on Schedule D in the earnings news release can be found. It shows the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax was a $0.02 headwind. This represents a difference between the base tax rates of 24.1% this quarter versus 23% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions as well as the absence of the R&D and other tax credits, which expired at the end of 2011. We now expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be about 24%, 1 percentage point higher than our previous guidance, which equates to an additional $0.05 per share headwind for the full year. This revision reflects our latest view on the earnings mix.
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We are now estimating full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million, an increase of $15 million versus our original guidance. With that change, we expect pharma to be $225 million less than it was in 2011. 
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. You can see we delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 11% in the second quarter led by growth in Agriculture.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was $0.4 billion, essentially flat versus the prior year. At the end of the second quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2011, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 4% when you exclude the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year. 
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
In April, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, and we paid our 431st consecutive quarterly dividend last month. Additionally, we completed the repurchase of $400 million of shares in the month of May.
In summary, for the second quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Global volume for the company declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, but improved sequentially excluding Agriculture. As a result of our strong execution and portfolio diversity, we delivered a double-digit increase in the underlying total segment PTOI excluding pharma in sight -- in spite of this very challenging market conditions that we're facing. 
Turning now to the third quarter. We expect sequential volume growth to continue particularly in PV, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. Additionally, we expect volume growth on a year-over-year basis, albeit off of a easier comp. Karen will provide more details when she covers the individual segments.
For the full year, there are several items that we see as either headwinds or tailwinds. Weaker macros, a stronger dollar and higher tax rate are some of the headwinds. On the other hand, lower import costs will certainly be a tailwind. Taking these items into consideration, we expect full year earnings to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share excluding significant items. Additionally, we expect earnings in the second half of the year to be split about evenly between quarters 3 and quarters 4. 
Some of our businesses are impacted more from the changing macros than other businesses. However, each of our businesses has meaningful externally benchmarked performance targets. These businesses that are not executing against their targets are being required to provide even more productivity gains. These businesses are taking actions in a variety of ways including reducing expenditures and tightly managing their cash. They are also shifting resources as new opportunities are identified. All of our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to the changing demand signals and to continue to serve our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. 
Lastly, I would like to remind investors that although we are taking actions to react to today's dynamic market conditions, we also remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing the top line 7% and earnings 12%. We continue to drive a disciplined process around innovation, productivity and differential management. We're committed to build on successes in developing markets, and we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of continuing to have a strong balance sheet. Our focus on these areas and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen who will review the segments. Karen?"

Our Agriculture segment continued their momentum established in the first quarter, underpinned by strong northern hemisphere execution in a robust ag market. Sales of $3.4 billion grew 13% with roughly equal contributions from volume and price. Earnings grew 12% to $926 million. First half sales of $7.5 billion grew 15% with earnings up 16% to $2.2 billion. 
Reviewing the individual businesses starting with seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.5 billion, up 12% with first half sales growing to $5.7 billion, up 16%. While first half growth reflects increased corn and soybean acres and strong price performance in North America, each region contributed positive price and volume growth. As a result, the business is expected to be at the top end of our goal to deliver 5% to 10% net price gains this year. North American growers have recognized the value of our Optimum AcreMax family of reduced and integrated refuge solutions. This is only the second commercial season for this technology, and adoption rates continue to exceed our expectations. Over 70% of above- and below-ground sales and about 10% of above-ground-only sales were in AcreMax technology, which is at the high end of our expected range. Additionally, growers planted over 2 million acres of our Optimum AQUAmax hybrids developed to deliver a yield advantage in water-limited environments. 
In soybeans, we grew sales through pricing gains and volume growth in North America. Our focus has been on optimizing the financial contribution of the breeding investment we made in soybeans. Through outstanding execution, we continue to lead the market based on the confidence customers have in our disease packages and all-around product performance.
Moving to Europe. Corn sales in the quarter were down year-over-year, as expected, following an early start to the season, which favored the first quarter. For the first half, pricing and volume contributed positively to sales growth. 
In crop protection, second quarter sales grew $879 million, up 15% with first half sales of $1.8 billion, up 11% led by volume growth in North America and Latin America. The results reflect growth across all product categories with notable strength in insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The broad success of our Rynaxypyr supports our aggressive investment effort to rapidly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatment to the market. We received our first registration of Cyazypyr in Argentina on July 13 and we expect to launch in the second half. We expect this franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry will grow to over $1 billion in the next few years.
Looking ahead to the second half for the Agriculture segment, our outlook remains unchanged as we expect high single-digit percentage sales growth and larger seasonal losses as compared to same period previous year. Second half sales anticipate strong business performance in both seeds and crop protection in Latin America, partially offset by significant currency headwinds primarily due to the rial and lower corn planting as growers in Argentina and Brazil are expected to move strongly to soybean. 
Sales growth is offset by continued investment in our Right Product, Right Acre strategy; new product launches; and long-term R&D build-out.
Moving to Slide 8 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $795 million were down 11%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver price pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials was enhanced by our industry-leading products like our latest Solamet paste gaining traction with customers, coupled with recovery from the inventory correction that began late last year. 
In consumer electronics, demand was up for our market-leading materials, driven by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. PTOI was down 27% on lower volume and plant utilization. Additionally in the prior year, PTOI was reduced $20 million due to extreme metal volatility. 
For third quarter, we expect sales down slightly due to pass-through of lower metal prices and PTOI up slightly on higher volume. Sequentially, the story is even stronger with earnings up substantially due to continued momentum in PV and consumer electronics. Photovoltaics remain a very dynamic market. We see installations continuing strong in the U.S. and China with new positive feed-in tariffs in Japan even as industry macros are weighing on the module makers. 
For the full year, we reaffirm our view of 10% growth in global installs, and our advanced materials will play an essential part in that.  On the consumer electronics side, launches of new mobile devices are expected to pull through our industry-leading materials like on Kapton Black. 
Now on to slide 9, Industrial Biosciences. It delivered sales of $300 million with growth predominantly from acquisitions. In biomaterials, our Sorona polymer continues to gain market adoption in carpets, thanks to our highly differentiated value proposition. PTOI of $44 million grew primarily because of acquisition but also from cost synergies, which are performing in line with expectations.
Turning to third quarter. We see sales up modestly and PTOI up substantially with realization of additional cost synergies. As in previous quarters, the generally good market fundamentals for enzymes are expected to remain favorable, albeit with some slowing of enzymes for ethanol given higher corn prices.
Turning now to Slide 10 for Nutrition & Health. The teams delivered a very strong performance in the quarter, posting sales of $885 million with earnings of $112 million. The quarter reflects the 2-month acquisition benefit in addition to growth in Solae. Our global teams have maintained the business momentum from these -- from our businesses, delivering pro forma sales growth in health and protection and enablers with both price and volume gains that more than offset currency headwind. 
For Solae, a key growth objective is to enhance product mix and earnings by growing the Solae specialty segment while optimizing the commodity segment. Towards that goal, Solae specialty posted mid-teens sales growth as our new products continue to penetrate the nutrition solutions and improved health segment of the food ingredients market. Pretax operating margins of 13% reflect the progress we're making on cost synergies with meaningful impact from timing lag on raw material cost inflation.
Moving to the outlook for third quarter. We expect moderate sales growth with substantial earnings growth. Year-over-year pretax operating margins will be up substantially, reflecting business mix and cost synergies, but will be tempered sequentially due to raw material inflation. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were essentially flat as higher prices offset lower volume. Versus a sold-out environment last year, TiO2 demand was down particularly in Europe and to a less extent, Asia, while North America showed strength. Within the quarter, we saw growing momentum particularly in Asia. As an example, China's June sales were our strongest year-to-date for TiO2. Strong demand in industrial chemicals like cyanide also provided an uplift to the quarter's result. PTOI of $538 million was up 7% despite higher ore costs, reflecting our technologically advantaged process and consistent gains in productivity. 
In third quarter, we expect sales down modestly and PTOI down substantially versus a very strong comp of TiO2 and robust fluoroproducts demand a year ago. In spite of the uncertain global macro environment, segment outlook is for sequential improvement. Additionally, we reiterate our view of flat segment margins year-over-year for Performance Chemicals on slightly lower volume. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Higher OEM volume, tied to a 10% increase in auto builds, helped the quarter. These increases were more than offset by weaker refinish and powder coatings volumes primarily in Europe, resulting from weak macro conditions. PTOI increased 26% with 180 basis point margin expansion, which resulted from pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains, partially offset by unfavorable currency.  
For the third quarter, we expect segment sales to be essentially flat in spite of unfavorable currency. PTOI is expected to be up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. 
Now turning to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Automotive-related demand continued to improve, particularly in North America. This was offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Europe and Asia Pacific. However, we did see sequential growth in electronics in Asia. Additionally, packaging markets improved modestly. PTOI increased 25% primarily due to lower feedstock costs, higher volume, improved mix partially offset by unfavorable currency. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down modestly as stronger volume will be offset by lower U.S. dollar selling prices, primarily due to currency headwind. PTOI is expected to be up substantially on a stronger mix.
On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower public sector demand and continued softness in industrial markets. PTOI was down 11% on weaker mix, unfavorable currency and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar plant, partially offset by value-based pricing actions. 
For the third quarter, sales are expected to be up slightly with higher demand, principally in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by unfavorable currency. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, utilizing the latest technology installed in our new Cooper River plant, are being very well received in the market. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement from Nomex from higher infrastructure spend and Tyvek in worker protection markets. PTOI is expected to be up modestly on stronger volume and improved fixed cost leverage, partially offset by unfavorable currency. 
That concludes our review of the segments. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Ellen."

As Nick already stated, we expect full year earnings, excluding significant items, to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share due to the uncertainties of the global macro conditions, currency and",708,"Great. Thank you, Karen. As Nick already stated, we expect full year earnings, excluding significant items, to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share due to the uncertainties of the global macro conditions, currency and anticipated higher tax rate due to earnings mix. Year-to-date, you've seen the strength and resiliency of our portfolio plus disciplined execution combine for earnings that were better than expected, and we intend to finish the year with the same discipline and focus. We remain committed to differentially managing our portfolio and invest in markets where growth remains attractive. Our innovation centers an important tool in this effort and they're places where we can focus resource and leverage the power of DuPont innovation in order to pursue growth opportunities in developing markets. 
As the result of a series -- of very purposeful actions, investment innovation, selective capacity expansion, acquisitions such as Danisco and Pannar, just to name a few, our portfolio is less cyclical than it was just 5 years ago, and we continue to drive productivity and benefit from the restructuring actions we implemented in 2009. 
Our business teams remain close to the markets and customers, ensuring that they are ready -- reading underlying demand signals from downstream markets and able to meet whatever changing customer needs they see. They're also focusing on innovation that truly add value to our customers and create opportunity for growth in new areas. 
Now I'd like to walk through some of the markets that are the most important to DuPont. Our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments will contribute about 1/3 of the company's sales and earnings this year. Agriculture and specialty food ingredient markets are expanding based on population growth and the demand for healthier food choices. Our businesses drive solutions to improve productivity and deliver more nutritious food. Success is contingent on our ability to continue to deliver products with improved performance for our customers year in and year out. And we have tremendous momentum with how customers have responded to our latest offering. 
TiO2, it's received a lot of attention lately. The market became soft in the second half of '11 and we've seen slow sequential recoveries since then. We believe that recent comments in the press regarding demand outlook overstated the softness of the market, so much so in fact that we publicly affirmed our confidence in the demand outlook. We expect sequential recovery to continue. We expect segment margin for 2012 to be comparable to 2011, which is among the highest in our portfolio right now. Keep in mind that overall fundamentals in this market are robust. Demand historically track GDP growth, and we anticipate only modest capacity additions to this market over the next 4 years. We expect favorable market conditions to remain during that time frame.
Moving to automotive. Our expectation of global builds is still about 5% growth this year, although that outlook varies from a 6% decline in Europe to 14% growth in North America with the rest of the world somewhere in between. 
And finally, electronic markets are improving. Consumer electronics is bolstered by continued strong demand for smartphones and tablets. Demand for photovoltaic materials has shown good sequential improvement since the downturn in the second half of 2011, and we continue to expect PV installations to be up 10% over last year. Overall, with DuPont's mix of products sold into electronic markets, we expect sequential recovery to continue in the second half.
So to summarize, second quarter came in about as expected against the backdrop of very dynamic market conditions. The company demonstrated strong execution and resiliency. The comments we've made about our performance and our outlook are very consistent with what we've been saying for the past couple of years: Innovation is the backbone of the company and we differentiate ourselves through our offerings. We are prioritizing resources and aligning with secular growth opportunities in food, energy and protection and productivity. It remains a way of life for each and every of our businesses. These are our constants, the essential drivers of our performance that enable us to deliver increased value for our shareholders over time. 
So now, we can open up the lines for your questions."

And so when you -- let me -- let's talk about the larger picture of where we are with the TiO2 business. The fundamentals really haven't changed here. We're still very bullish on the mid-, long-term prospects for TiO2. When you look at the growth that it has, relation to GDP, over the next 5 years the only significant new capacity being announced is DuPont. And there just isn't enough capacity announced to keep up with the demand at that sort of GDP growth rates. So we're seeing the basic fundamentals still intact moving forward even if there is a short-term period of demand contraction. We're also seeing our strong position based on the decades of innovation that we have, our #1 position around production capacity as well as our advantage position from a manufacturing technology standpoint. You couple all those macros with some of the specifics that are going on right now. When you look at -- even with this volume being somewhat depressed, you look at the earnings of this business in the year and you look at the margins of this business and you're still in line with what was performance was in last year's results.

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont executed well in the quarter and delivered strong results despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continued our momentum with particularly robust volume growth in agriculture, food and enzyme markets",494,"Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont executed well in the quarter and delivered strong results despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continued our momentum with particularly robust volume growth in agriculture, food and enzyme markets. Company sales were up 7% despite a 3% currency headwind. Excluding currency, sales were up in all regions. Sales to developing markets grew 11% versus a very strong comp. While volumes were down in Europe and Asia, we continue to see sequential improvement on a seasonally adjusted basis. Volumes were up 5% and 3% in China and India, respectively, versus the second quarter of 2011, which is another measure of good momentum in the regions. Underlying earnings grew 8% to $1.48 per share.  On a segment level, pretax operating income was up 13% excluding Pharmaceuticals. 
I'd like to highlight some of the important milestones from the quarter. First, we passed the one-year anniversary of the Danisco acquisition in May. The contributions and benefits from the acquisition have exceeded our expectation. We added 2 very attractive businesses to our portfolio and identified significant opportunities for cost and revenue synergies. This newly created reporting segments of Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences delivered strong performance this quarter and are expected to combine for over $4.5 billion in sales this year with a pretax operating margin in the 10% to 14% range. We will deliver $130 million of cost synergies by year end and expect additional productivity and margin expansion in 2013 and beyond. 
Another important milestone in the quarter was the conclusion of the northern hemisphere planting season. For the first half, Ag segment results were up 15% and pretax operating income up 16% driven by new products, strong relationships with our growers and an ever-expanding global footprint. In addition to a strong foundation in North America, we have built solid businesses in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, which offer additional attractive growth. 
Earlier this quarter, we announced government approval of the acquisition of Pannar Seed company, a leader in Africa, as yet another example of our global build-out. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight innovation milestones. We're tracking well versus our target of having 30% sales from new products introduced within the last 4 years. I'd like to give just one new product example from the quarter. Our performance polymers business responded quickly to address the global shortage of PA-12, a critical polymer for automotive applications. We accelerated the introduction of new grades of our Zytel product to allow the automotive industry to continue to produce parts with alternative materials. The contribution to business results is small in the quarter, but importantly, we demonstrated, again, DuPont to be a valued partner in helping the auto industry respond to a critical shortage. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Nick and Karen to review the quarter in more detail. Then I'll come back and close out the call with our views on the outlook; so, Nick."
268053,183072798,329595,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million or 9%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, a decrease in pharmaceutical income and",1355,"Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. 
Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million or 9%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, a decrease in pharmaceutical income and higher pension costs. This outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio, and moreover, the outstanding execution by our teams. Underlying earnings of $1.48 per share increased $0.11 compared to the $1.37 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.06 of headwinds relating to exchange losses and taxes. 
Consolidated net sales of $11 billion were up 7% versus the prior year. Local selling prices increased 6% with gains in all regions and most segments, reflecting the benefits from new product introductions coupled with our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added 5% to sales. 
Volume was down 1% from the near-peak level in the second quarter 2011. On a sequential basis, when you exclude Ag and adjust for seasonality, volumes improved 3% led by Asia-Pacific. We expect this momentum to continue as we head into the second half of the year, particularly in the photovoltaic, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. 
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter, looking at EPS variance analysis on Slide 4. Higher local selling prices resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit. Variable costs were a $0.03 headwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were up about 1% over the prior year. Input costs have moderated from the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 1% versus our previous assumption of 3%. The 2 percentage point improvement is primarily due to lower crude oil and ethane costs as well as more advantageous mixes of ores in our titanium dioxide business. The improvement also includes lower silver costs, which are passed through to the customer so there's no associated earnings impact. Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.06 per share.
Let's move to fixed costs, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share when you exclude currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects growth investments including increased R&D and marketing initiatives in the Ag segment and costs associated with operating the new Kevlar and Tedlar plans. I would also like to note that the fixed costs increase includes a $0.04 of higher noncash pension costs over prior year. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we've delivered approximately $190 million of fixed costs productivity year-to-date. We're well on our way toward exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year.
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 variance in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.30 to $0.35 headwind for the full year, compared to our previous guidance of $0.20 to $0.25. For third quarter alone, the stronger dollar would result in about a $0.12 to $0.14 headwind versus prior year.  
Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a net $0.06 benefit primarily reflecting the acquisition of Danisco. 
Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation on Schedule D in the earnings news release can be found. It shows the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax was a $0.02 headwind. This represents a difference between the base tax rates of 24.1% this quarter versus 23% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions as well as the absence of the R&D and other tax credits, which expired at the end of 2011. We now expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be about 24%, 1 percentage point higher than our previous guidance, which equates to an additional $0.05 per share headwind for the full year. This revision reflects our latest view on the earnings mix.
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We are now estimating full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million, an increase of $15 million versus our original guidance. With that change, we expect pharma to be $225 million less than it was in 2011. 
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. You can see we delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 11% in the second quarter led by growth in Agriculture.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was $0.4 billion, essentially flat versus the prior year. At the end of the second quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2011, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 4% when you exclude the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year. 
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
In April, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, and we paid our 431st consecutive quarterly dividend last month. Additionally, we completed the repurchase of $400 million of shares in the month of May.
In summary, for the second quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Global volume for the company declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, but improved sequentially excluding Agriculture. As a result of our strong execution and portfolio diversity, we delivered a double-digit increase in the underlying total segment PTOI excluding pharma in sight -- in spite of these very challenging market conditions that we're facing. 
Turning now to the third quarter. We expect sequential volume growth to continue particularly in PV, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. Additionally, we expect volume growth on a year-over-year basis, albeit off of a easier comp. Karen will provide more details when she covers the individual segments.
For the full year, there are several items that we see as either headwinds or tailwinds. Weaker macros, a stronger dollar and higher tax rate are some of the headwinds. On the other hand, lower import costs will certainly be a tailwind. Taking these items into consideration, we expect full year earnings to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share excluding significant items. Additionally, we expect earnings in the second half of the year to be split about evenly between quarters 3 and quarters 4. 
Some of our businesses are impacted more from the changing macros than other businesses. However, each of our businesses has meaningful externally benchmarked performance targets. These businesses that are not executing against their targets are being required to provide even more productivity gains. These businesses are taking actions in a variety of ways including reducing expenditures and tightly managing their cash. They are also shifting resources as new opportunities are identified. All of our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to the changing demand signals and to continue to serve our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. 
Lastly, I would like to remind investors that although we are taking actions to react to today's dynamic market conditions; we also remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing the top line 7% and earnings 12%. We continue to drive a disciplined process around innovation, productivity and differential management. We're committed to build on successes in developing markets, and we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of continuing to have a strong balance sheet. Our focus on these areas and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen who will review the segments. Karen?"

Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first quarter, underpinned by strong northern hemisphere execution in a robust ag market. Sales of $3.4 billion grew 13% with roughly equal contributions from volume and price. Earnings grew 12% to $926 million. First half sales of $7.5 billion grew 15% with earnings up 16% to $2.2 billion. 
Reviewing the individual businesses starting with seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.5 billion, up 12% with first half sales growing to $5.7 billion, up 16%. While first half growth reflects increased corn and soybean acres and strong price performance in North America, each region contributed positive price and volume growth. As a result, the business is expected to be at the top end of our goal to deliver 5% to 10% net price gains this year. North American growers have recognized the value of our Optimum AcreMax family of reduced and integrated refuge solutions. This is only the second commercial season for these technologies, and adoption rates continue to exceed our expectations. Over 70% of above- and below-ground sales and about 10% of above-ground-only sales were in AcreMax technology, which is at the high end of our expected range. Additionally, growers planted over 2 million acres of our Optimum AQUAmax hybrids developed to deliver a yield advantage in water-limited environments. 
In soybeans, we grew sales through pricing gains and volume growth in North America. Our focus has been on optimizing the financial contribution of the breeding investment we made in soybeans. Through outstanding execution, we continue to lead the market based on the confidence customers have in our disease packages and all-around product performance.
Moving to Europe. Corn sales in the quarter were down year-over-year, as expected, following an early start to the season, which favored the first quarter. For the first half, pricing and volume contributed positively to sales growth. 
In crop protection, second quarter sales grew to $879 million, up 15% with first half sales of $1.8 billion up 11% led by volume growth in North America and Latin America. The results reflect growth across all product categories with notable strength in insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The broad success of Rynaxypyr supports our aggressive investment effort to rapidly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatment to the market. We received our first registration of Cyazypyr in Argentina on July 13 and we expect to launch in the second half. We expect this franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry will grow to over $1 billion in the next few years.
Looking ahead to the second half for the Agriculture segment, our outlook remains unchanged as we expect high single-digit percentage sales growth and larger seasonal losses as compared to same period previous year. Second half sales anticipate strong business performance in both seeds and crop protection in Latin America, partially offset by significant currency headwinds primarily due to the rial and lower corn planting as growers in Argentina and Brazil are expected to move strongly to soybean. 
Sales growth is offset by continued investment in our Right Product, Right Acre strategy; new product launches; and long-term R&D build-out.
Moving to Slide 8 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $795 million were down 11%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver price pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials was enhanced by our industry-leading products like our latest Solamet paste gaining traction with customers, coupled with recovery from the inventory correction that began late last year. 
In consumer electronics, demand was up for our market-leading materials, driven by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. PTOI was down 27% on lower volume and plant utilization. Additionally in the prior year, PTOI was reduced $20 million due to extreme metal volatility. 
For third quarter, we expect sales down slightly due to pass-through of lower metal prices and PTOI up slightly on higher volume. Sequentially, the story is even stronger with earnings up substantially due to continued momentum in PV and consumer electronics. Photovoltaics remain a very dynamic market. We see installations continuing strong in the U.S. and China with new positive feed-in tariffs in Japan even as industry macros are weighing on the module makers. 
For the full year, we reaffirm our view of 10% growth in global installs, and our advanced materials will play an essential part in that.  On the consumer electronics side, launches of new mobile devices are expected to pull through our industry-leading materials like Kapton Black. 
Now on to slide 9, Industrial Biosciences. We delivered sales of $300 million with growth predominantly from acquisitions. In biomaterials, our Sorona polymer continues to gain market adoption in carpets, thanks to our highly differentiated value proposition. PTOI of $44 million grew primarily because of acquisition but also from cost synergies, which are performing in line with expectations.
Turning to third quarter. We see sales up modestly and PTOI up substantially with realization of additional cost synergies. As in previous quarters, the generally good market fundamentals for enzymes are expected to remain favorable, albeit with some slowing of enzymes for ethanol given higher corn prices.
Turning now to Slide 10 for Nutrition & Health. The teams delivered a very strong performance in the quarter, posting sales of $885 million with earnings of $112 million. The quarter reflects the 2-month acquisition benefit in addition to growth in Solae. Our global teams have maintained the business momentum from these -- from our businesses, delivering pro forma sales growth in health and protection and enablers with both price and volume gains that more than offset currency headwinds. 
For Solae, a key growth objective is to enhance product mix and earnings by growing the Solae specialty segment while optimizing the commodity segment. Towards that goal, Solae specialty posted mid teens sales growth as our new products continue to penetrate the nutrition solutions and improved health segment of the food ingredients market. Pretax operating margins of 13% reflect the progress we're making on cost synergies with meaningful impact from timing lag on raw material cost inflation.
Moving to the outlook for third quarter. We expect moderate sales growth with substantial earnings growth. Year-over-year pretax operating margins will be up substantially, reflecting business mix and cost synergies, but will be tempered sequentially due to raw material inflation. 
Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were essentially flat as higher prices offset lower volume. Versus a sold-out environment last year, TiO2 demand was down particularly in Europe and to a lesser extent, Asia, while North America showed strength. Within the quarter, we saw growing momentum particularly in Asia. As an example, China's June sales were our strongest year-to-date for TiO2. Strong demand in industrial chemicals like cyanide also provided an uplift to the quarter's result. PTOI of $538 million was up 7% despite higher ore costs, reflecting our technologically advantaged process and consistent gains in productivity. 
In third quarter, we expect sales down modestly and PTOI down substantially versus a very strong comp of tight TiO2 and robust fluoroproducts demand a year ago. In spite of the uncertain global macro environment, segment outlook is for sequential improvement. Additionally, we reiterate our view of flat segment margins year-over-year for Performance Chemicals on slightly lower volume. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Higher OEM volume, tied to a 10% increase in auto builds, helped the quarter. These increases were more than offset by weaker refinish and powder coatings volumes primarily in Europe, resulting from weak macro conditions. PTOI increased 26% with 180 basis point margin expansion, which resulted from pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains, partially offset by unfavorable currency.  
For the third quarter, we expect segment sales to be essentially flat in spite of unfavorable currency. PTOI is expected to be up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. 
Now turning to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Automotive-related demand continued to improve, particularly in North America. This was offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Europe and Asia-Pacific. However, we did see sequential growth in electronics in Asia. Additionally, packaging markets improved modestly. PTOI increased 25% primarily due to lower feedstock costs, higher volume, improved mix partially offset by unfavorable currency. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down modestly as stronger volume will be offset by lower U.S. dollar selling prices, primarily due to currency headwind. PTOI is expected to be up substantially on a stronger mix.
On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower public sector demand and continued softness in industrial markets. PTOI was down 11% on weaker mix, unfavorable currency and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar plant, partially offset by value-based pricing actions. 
For the third quarter, sales are expected to be up slightly with higher demand, principally in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by unfavorable currency. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, utilizing the latest technology installed in our new Cooper River plant, are being very well received in the market. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement from Nomex from higher infrastructure spend and Tyvek in worker protection markets. PTOI is expected to be up modestly on stronger volume and improved fixed cost leverage, partially offset by unfavorable currency. 
That concludes our review of the segments. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Ellen."

Thank you, Karen. As Nick already stated, we expect full year earnings, excluding significant items, to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share due to the uncertainties of the global macro conditions, currency and anticipated higher tax rate due to earnings mix. Year-to-date, you've seen the strength and resiliency of our portfolio plus disciplined execution combine for earnings that were better than expected, and we intend to finish the year with the same discipline and focus. We remain committed to differentially managing our portfolio and invest in markets where growth remains attractive. Our innovation centers are an important tool in this effort and they’re places where we can focus resource and leverage the power of DuPont innovation in order to pursue growth opportunities in developing markets. 
As the result of a series of very purposeful actions, investment innovation, selective capacity expansion, acquisitions such as Danisco and Pannar, just to name a few, our portfolio is less cyclical than it was just 5 years ago, and we continue to drive productivity and benefit from the restructuring actions we implemented in 2009. 
Our business teams remain close to the markets and customers, ensuring that they are ready -- reading underlying demand signals from downstream markets and able to meet whatever changing customer needs they see. They're also focusing on innovation that truly add value to our customers and create opportunity for growth in new areas. 
Now I'd like to walk through some of the markets that are the most important to DuPont. Our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments will contribute about 1/3 of the company's sales and earnings this year. Agriculture and specialty food ingredient markets are expanding based on population growth and the demand for healthier food choices. Our businesses drive solutions to improve productivity and deliver more nutritious food. Success is contingent on our ability to continue to deliver products with improved performance for our customers year in and year out. And we have tremendous momentum with how customers have responded to our latest offering. 
TiO2, it's received a lot of attention lately. The market became soft in the second half of '11 and we've seen slow sequential recovery since then. We believe that recent comments in the press regarding demand outlook overstated the softness of the market, so much so in fact that we publicly affirmed our confidence in the demand outlook. We expect sequential recovery to continue. We expect segment margin for 2012 to be comparable to 2011, which is among the highest in our portfolio right now. Keep in mind that overall fundamentals in this market are robust. Demands historically track GDP growth, and we anticipate only modest capacity additions to this market over the next 4 years. We expect favorable market conditions to remain during that timeframe.
Moving to automotive. Our expectation of global builds is still about 5% growth this year, although that outlook varies from a 6% decline in Europe to 14% growth in North America with the rest of the world somewhere in between. 
And finally, electronic markets are improving. Consumer electronics is bolstered by continued strong demand for smartphones and tablets. Demand for photovoltaic materials has shown good sequential improvement since the downturn in the second half of 2011, and we continue to expect PV installations to be up 10% over last year. Overall, with DuPont's mix of products sold into electronic markets, we expect sequential recovery to continue in the second half.
So to summarize, second quarter came in about as expected against the backdrop of very dynamic market conditions. The company demonstrated strong execution and resiliency. The comments we've made about our performance and our outlook are very consistent with what we've been saying for the past couple of years: Innovation is the backbone of the company and we differentiate ourselves through our offerings. We are prioritizing resources and aligning with secular growth opportunities in food, energy and protection and productivity. It remains a way of life for each and every of our businesses. These are our constants, the essential drivers of our performance that enable us to deliver increased value for our shareholders over time.

We're still very bullish on the mid-, long-term prospects for TiO2. When you look at the growth that it has, relation to GDP, over the next 5 years the only significant new capacity being announced is DuPont. And there just isn't enough capacity announced to keep up with the demand at that sort of GDP growth rate. So we're seeing the basic fundamentals still intact moving forward even if there is a short-term period of demand contraction. We're also seeing our strong position based on the decades of innovation that we have, our #1 position around production capacity as well as our advantage position from a manufacturing technology standpoint. You couple all those macros with some of the specifics that are going on right now. When you look at -- even with this volume being somewhat depressed, you look at the earnings of this business in the year and you look at the margins of this business and you're still in line with what was performance was in last year's results.

In a few minutes, we'll walk through our results for the quarter and provide color on markets and business performance. Before we do that, I want to discuss our actions to build and deliver value for shareholders, as we sharpen our competitiveness and confront our most immediate challenges. We continue to manage the company knowing that sustained growth and competitiveness require a dynamic agile organization that is deeply connected to customers and markets. Our businesses and corporate functions are constantly working towards that goal. This is how we step up to market challenges, outperform the competition and grow. Continuing macroeconomic uncertainty and resulting slowing demand in certain sectors are reminders of why agility and productivity must be a way of life. 
Today, we're announcing additional actions we have launched to improve competitiveness and accelerate market-driven innovation and growth by fine-tuning the organization, eliminating cost and expanding targeted productivity progress. This effort is somewhat surgical in that each of our businesses have assessed what action, if any, is warranted versus their market conditions and competitive set. Our actions reflect differential management of the portfolio and not a one-size-fits-all approach. 
I'd like to underscore some of the more important elements of what we're doing. Weaker transactions involving Performance Coatings and Danisco, advance DuPont's mission to be the world's most dynamic science company, with the long-term strategy of driving competitive advantage in Agriculture and Nutrition, Advanced Materials and Industrial Biotechnology, all of which represents high growth, high-margin opportunities. Over time, you will begin to see the full effect of these transactions as we redeploy capital and fully integrate Danisco and Solae, generating new growth opportunities in high-margin parts of our business. 
We set aggressive cost targets for these transactions. In the case of Danisco, we're delivering $130 million in cost synergies by year end, well ahead of the original schedule. In the case of DTC, we will eliminate $230 million in residual costs associated with the divestiture. We will take the same disciplined approach to eliminate these costs as we have in addressing the Danisco cost synergies. 
Based on what we learned during the separation process, we identified additional actions to reduce corporate costs to further simplify and streamline our global infrastructure. We are better aligning the design and cost of corporate functions with business growth strategies and the expected impact of changing market conditions. In addition, current uncertainty in the global economic outlook, softer demand in certain markets and strength in others require realigning business resources to match current growth opportunities and increase responsiveness to rapidly changing market realities. Businesses have identified cost-saving opportunities by optimizing supply chains, consolidating facilities and refining their organizations geographically to improve competitiveness and margins. It's important to recognize that these actions unlock capital, drive innovation and will deliver growth faster. In order to ensure continued competitiveness at both the function and business levels, our leaders identified action to deliver $220 million in savings. This combines with the elimination of $230 million in residual cost for a total of $450 million in benefits. This restructuring work is in addition to ongoing productivity programs that address cost and working capital. All of these actions are part of a continuum for DuPont, but they obviously take on particular importance given the quarter's results. This has result in the third quarter reflect continued weak market conditions in Europe and uncertainty in Asia. The bright spots were strong performance in Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials. The most challenged segments this quarter were Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. Agricultural market fundamentals were remained strong, supported by robust demand and a healthy outlook for farm income. You will recall last year, this segment delivered outstanding growth in sales and earnings in Latin America. And despite such a strong third quarter comp and a 10% currency headwind, Ag sales were up 4% this quarter. We remain bullish about the growth opportunities for our seed and Crop Protection businesses, as the Latin American planting season continues in the fourth quarter and the northern hemisphere season gets underway. And we are bullish on the solid momentum we have heading into 2013. 
On Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences segment grew 10% and 5%, respectively, when excluding currency impact. Those businesses delivered impressive earnings growth, with PTOI margin expansion of 300 basis points in the quarter. These results demonstrate the outstanding work by the businesses to deliver customer value through innovation and delivered cost synergies from the Danisco acquisition ahead of schedule. 
Performance Chemicals earnings were down 37%, which reflected earnings decline in both businesses within this segment. Weaker economic conditions, particularly in China and Europe, are reducing demand for TiO2 and fluoropolymers, specifically connected to construction and infrastructure. These businesses continue to focus on customer service, drive fixed cost and working capital productivity and, in the case of TiO2, reduced cost by shifting to lower cost or blend. 
Electronics & Communications earnings decline was essentially all related to weak photovoltaic markets and an oversupply of PV modules. Trade actions in the United States and trade investigations in the European Union add to market uncertainty and are negatively impacting demand. The bright spot in the segment was the consumer electronic market, bolstered by demand for smartphones and tablets. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Nick to go through third quarter financials. And after the segment reviews, I'll share a perspective on key markets going forward. Nick?"

This decline reflects the market conditions that",1307,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Underlying earnings from continuing operations of $0.32 per share were down $0.28 versus the prior year. This decline reflects the market conditions that Ellen just covered, as well as $0.28 of headwind from currency, taxes, lower pharmaceutical income, noncash pension costs and exchange losses. 
Consolidated net sales of $7.4 billion were down 9% versus the prior year. Volume declined to 5% as increases in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. Volume in Asia-Pacific declined 10%, primarily due to lower TiO2 and photovoltaic materials volume. Excluding Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications, Asia-Pacific volume was up slightly year-over-year. 
Local selling prices increased 1% with declines in Asia-Pacific, partially offsetting gains in the other regions. The single largest driver for the drop in local prices in Asia-Pacific resulted from the decrease in silver cost, related to our Solamet case, which as we've discussed with you before, is passed through direct to the customer. For more information regarding the company sales by geographic region, please see Slide 4. 
As Ellen mentioned earlier, today, we announced a restructuring plan, which is summarized on Slide 5. This plan will deliver total pretax cost savings of $450 million by eliminating corporate cost previously allocated to Performance Coatings, while taking additional cost-cutting actions to improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver $300 million of savings in 2013 and the full amount in 2014. Our targets have been established from the bottom up, with specific projects already identified and rigorous modeling and accountability in place. To achieve these savings, we expect to record a restructuring charge of about $210 million, $152 million of this charge was recorded in the third quarter with the balance to come in quarter 4. These actions will make us a leaner, more agile company and better position all of our businesses for future growth. 
I'd like to point out that the savings associated with the restructuring plan will essentially offset the dilutive earnings effect associated with the divesting of their Performance Coatings business. And speaking of the Performance Coatings business teacher, the transaction is progressing as planned, and we expect to close the sale in the first quarter of next year. We estimate the after-tax proceeds will be about $4 billion. This is a preliminary figure, recognizing the tax calculation is complex and involves many factors that are not yet finalized. We'll provide you a final number when the sale closes. 
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 6, which is shown on the continuing operations basis. First, higher local selling prices resulted in a $0.05 per share benefit. Excluding currency, variable costs were a $0.17 tailwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were down about 5% versus the prior year. While we recognized these costs will be lower in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an increase of about 1% for the full year. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, our overall 5% volume decline reduced earnings by $0.15 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, excluding currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects 3% of higher noncash pension costs and a $0.02 lower plant utilizations charges, as well as higher spending on growth investments, primarily R&D and marketing initiatives in the Agricultural segment. The lower plant utilizations charges did not represent increases in spending, but rather, we're primarily the result of lower volumes in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. These are a fixed manufacturing cost, normally reflected in inventory that are expensed when production rates drop below normal operating levels. This helps to ensure our inventory values are not inflated. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we have delivered approximately $285 million of fixed cost productivity to date, well on our way towards exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year. I'd like to reiterate what Ellen said earlier. The restructuring plan we announced today is in addition to these ongoing productivity programs. 
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.13 variance in the quarter. As current -- at current exchange rates, we expect about $0.27 headwinds for the full year on a continuing operations basis. This equates to about a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. 
Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.02 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule B in the earnings news release to show you the extent that our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax was a $0.05 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate of 24% this quarter and 17% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in high-tax-rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of the U.S. R&D credit and other tax provisions, which expired at the end of 2011. For the full year of 2012, we expect the base tax rate on a continuing ops basis to be about 22%. 
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We continue to expect full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million or $225 million less than that in 2011. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. Third quarter free cash flow, on a total company basis, was about $250 million or $350 million less than last year. On a year-to-date basis, total company free cash flow was about $800 million lower than last year, primarily reflecting the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. Pension Plan that we made earlier this year, as well as some other onetime item payments. 
In light of our current operating environment, we have reduced our planned capital expenditures for the full year to about $1.9 billion or 10% below our previous guidance. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our Aa2 rating and work to maintain the associated metric that support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain that strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
Last month, we paid our 432nd consecutive quarterly dividend. 
In summary for the third quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Our businesses executed well, as they faced a wide array of market conditions. Each business has externally benchmarked performance targets against which they are all executing well while outperforming their peers set. 
Turning now to the rest of the year on Slide 8. We expect the full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations to be $3.25 to $3.30 per share, excluding significant items. This outlook primarily reflects sequential lower earnings in Performance Chemicals and Agriculture in the fourth quarter versus the third. Karen will provide some more details when she covers the segments. 
Lastly, I want to take a moment to reflect on how the recent portfolio and restructuring actions fit with our long-term strategy. The DPC divestiture, coupled with the Danisco acquisition last year, are consistent with our intent to focus on high-growth, high-margin opportunities with innovation critical to success. Today's announcement around restructuring actions will help mitigate the earnings dilution from the DPC divestiture, while positioning our businesses to be more agile and profitable long term. In addition, we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of our strong balance sheet. Our focus on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success. With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review the segments. Karen?"

Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals",1864,"Thanks, Nick. Turning to Slide 9. Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals. Third quarter sales of $1.4 billion grew 4%, with gains in volume and local price partially offset by currency, primarily the Brazilian real. Typical seasonal losses increased to $85 million, as sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency, continued investment in research, selling and agronomy positions in our North America and Brazil businesses and multiple product launch activities. 
Reviewing the individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $601 million were up 1%. Volume gains and insect control products and fungicides led the way with local pricing gains in all segments, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Regionally, we grew in the key markets of the United States, Latin America and Europe, overcoming the negative effects of currency. Our blockbuster insect control products powered by Rynaxypyr are on pace to grow 20% this year. In the third quarter, we successfully launched Cyazypyr insect control products in Argentina and Dermacor insect control seed treatment in Mexico. We continue to pursue registrations of these complementary insect control portfolios in additional countries and markets. In combination, these new innovative technologies derived from the same novel chemical class are on track to achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual portfolio of sales in the next few years. 
Moving to the seed business. Third quarter sales grew to $822 million, up 6%. The quarter reflected strong performance in Latin America, South Africa and South Asia. In Brazil, summer season corn sales are up despite hectare shifting from corn to soybeans. We expect pricing and share gains in summer corn, following a successful 2012 Safrinha season. These successes are result of a multiyear plan to reinvest in our research production and go-to-market capabilities. Growers continue to see robust performance and insect control with our hybrids containing the Herculex 1 insect trade. This summer, we've expanded our options as we launched Optimum Intrasect in Brazil with 2 modes of action for aboveground insect control. Recent investments in production and distribution capacity are also paying off, as Brazilian growers are increasing demand for locally developed, high-yielding high-quality Pioneer brand soybeans. The USDA will issue a final acreage until January of next year, so we can share some preliminary results based upon the recent October report. We held North America corn market share flat in 2012, following gains of 6 points since 2008. Double-digit pricing gains and the highest planting corn acres since 1937 resulted in significant growth in corn sales. Soybeans also experienced significant sales growth from improved price realization and higher planted acres. Soybean market share is projected to be flat to slightly down, following gains of more than 10 points since 2008. 
Finally, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which is advance this year due to the early planting season and the widespread drought conditions. Growers planted Optimum AQUAmax on over 2 million acres in 2012. And these products performed exceptionally well. AQUAmax hybrids stayed healthier and longer and, most importantly, delivered more bushels at harvest. On more than 4000 side-by-side comparisons with competitive products, preliminary 2012 yield data shows an advantage of more than 8% with AQUAmax products in water-limited environments. 
Our Optimum AcreMax 1 and AcreMax XTRA triple set hybrids, containing the Herculex rootworm trait, performed well under this year's heavy corn rootworm infestation and drought stress. We'll round out the lineup in 2013 with the addition of Optimum AcreMax XTreme, which contains dual modes of action for both above and below ground insect control. AcreMax XTreme recently received all necessary regulatory approvals for grain import into major world market. So we look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest results in the next few weeks. 
Moving now to the segment outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect significant sales increases versus a tough prior year comp. Seasonal fourth quarter losses will be substantially larger year-over-year and about double the size of the third quarter loss, as sales growth have moderated by higher production costs, new product launches in Crop Protection and Pioneer and continued growth investments. We now expect full year margins for the segment to be about flat year-over-year, which actually is an improved outlook from earlier this year and attribute to solid execution by both businesses. 
Looking forward to 2013, the fundamentals for Agriculture remain strong, as we prepare for the upcoming Safrinha season in Brazil and the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere. Our teams are working diligently with farmers to supply them with the seeds, crop protection products and knowledge to meet the world's growing needs for feed, food and renewable resources. 
Moving to Slide 10 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $607 million were down 28%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver cost pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials declined due to inventory destocking throughout the PV value chain. In addition, trade actions in the United States and investigations in Europe are creating downward pressure on demand. In consumer electronics, we continue to see strong demand for our market-leading materials, fueled by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. And our packaging graphics business remain stable. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be essentially flat with a substantial earnings declined. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2011 results included a $20 million licensing payment. If we exclude this item, earnings will be up substantially. 
With respect to the photovoltaic market, we rolled our outlook for PV installations in the second half, reflecting today's market environment and pending trade actions. Our current estimate is that global PV installation rates for 2012 will be flat-to-low-single digits, depending on the fourth quarter installation rate. There are no major subsidies firing at year-end, which has historically cost spikes in fourth quarter demand. DuPont products like Solamet and Kevlar remained industry leaders, and we are committed to our mission of being the leader supplier of differentiated materials for photovoltaics and consumer and other electronic markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $292 million were flat, as 7% volume growth was offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Volume growth occurred in all regions and reflects continued strong demand for DuPont Sorona renewable resourced polymer for carpet fiber and growth in key enzyme businesses from new product launches. PTOI of $42 million was up $8 million or 24% on higher volume and the realization of cost synergies related to the integration of Danisco enzyme business. Enzyme sales for ethanol were significantly lower, as spreads between ethanol and corn prices continue to challenge the ethanol industry. 
Moving to the fourth quarter, we see sales up moderately and PTOI up substantially, as we continue to realize cost synergies from integration. As a result of these productivity gains and improved margins in biomaterials, full year margin is expected to be up over 3 percentage points compared to prior year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for Nutrition & Health. Strong execution in the quarter resulted in the business posting sales of $876 million, with earnings of $87 million, which are up 58%. All product lines contributed to solid 4% volume growth, led by enablers, Solae soy specialties, probiotics, cultures and sweeteners. Local pricing improved in all regions as continued mix enrichment and pricing actions, in response to key raw material increases, were offset by the negative effect of currency. Our global teams continue to focus on growing the business, while integration remains on track to deliver meaningful revenue and cost synergies. 
Our innovation and productivity mindset is evident, as full year margins will be about 10%, which is a 3-percentage-point improvement over 2011. 
Moving to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect moderate sales growth despite the impact of currency and substantial earnings growth with a benefit of continued cost synergies. Sequential margins will be pressured down in the fourth quarter due to raw material inflation. 
Now let's discuss Performance Chemicals on Slide 13. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 19% with 18% lower volume and 1% lower selling price versus an extremely tough comp in 2011. Titanium dioxide and fluoropolymer volumes were pressured by a decline in spending in infrastructure and construction in Asia Pacific and ongoing weakness in Europe. PTOI of $372 million was down 37%, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable currency. One bright spot was the continued robust demand in industrial chemicals for cyanide and handling. Despite the weaker quarter, year-to-date segment PTOI is down only modestly when compared to last year's strong earnings performance. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down significantly and earnings down substantially. We expect continued softness, while TiO2 producers reduce existing inventory levels. On a positive note, customer inventory levels have declined from previous highs and long-term industry fundamentals remain solid. Long-term growth remains tightly correlated to GDP. So for now, we continue to stay close to customers and drive productivity. And we look for this market to bottom in the first half of next year. We see several potential triggers for recovery, including new investment in Asia infrastructure, some stability in Europe and the continued recovery in growth in the U.S. housing market. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales of $1.6 billion were down 8%, primarily due to lower selling prices and currency. Packaging volumes remained stable, and modest improvement in automotive were partially offset by unfavorable currency and softness in Asia-Pacific electronic markets. PTOI of $306 million increased $75 million on value pricing, lower feedstock costs and positive mix. Continuing productivity efforts also contributed to margin expansion. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down modestly, with global auto builds flat and continued soft demand in industrial and electronics markets. We expect PTOI to be up substantially versus weak comps on lower costs and value pricing. 
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales declined 7% on 4% lower selling prices due to unfavorable currency and 3% lower volume. The volume decline was primarily due to stalled infrastructure projects in China, weaker industrial conditions in Europe and the U.S. Military delaying tender on orders. PTOI was down 13% primarily due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. 
For the fourth quarter, sales are expected to be essentially flat. We see continued softness in industrial markets and inconsistent spending in the public sector. With the continued new home construction rebound in the U.S., we are seeing a pickup in sales of home rep. While this is off a very small base and we do not foresee this being a big needle mover in the near term, we expect the increased demand in this market will continue into 2013. Fourth quarter PTOI is expected to be down moderately due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. Going forward, S&P will face significant productivity improvement in future years from the restructuring plan that we announced today. So with that, I conclude the segment update and turn the call over for Ellen. create"

Thank you, Karen. ahead of market trends and taking action to position ourselves well for what lies ahead are cornerstones of how we operate. As we head into the fourth quarter and beyond, we are laser-focused on those principles that keep us competitive and drive our growth. We continue to execute well in most parts of the company. And certain segments such as Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials are outperforming despite market volatility and soft macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing our challenges head-on. We must continue to stay close to customers. We do this routinely to understand their needs and develop new products that capitalize fully on market rebound and support attractive margins. This connection is also how we gain insight on demand signals, which is critically important where markets are volatile. Our focus on market-driven innovation and the new products we deliver are intrinsic to several opportunities we see for growth, heading into next year. 
First, our Agriculture business is poised to pay us $10 billion in sales this year. We're heading into 2013 with strong momentum. We've made tremendous progress in our C genetics in our Crop Protection pipeline over the past decades and been rewarded with market share and excellent growth in the U.S. and internationally. And this includes very attractive returns. Everything is in place to continue that track record next year. 
Second, 2013 is a foundational year for some of the important long-term growth opportunities in industrial biotechnologies and OLED. There are short-term milestones to watch for these areas that include breaking ground on a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant and steps that we and our partners take to scale up, validate and move closer to commercialization of DuPont OLED technology. A third opportunity for innovation is in automotive where market continues to recover, and we're aggressively building on our strong presence. In July, we announced an expansion of our successful innovation center in Nagoya, Japan; and last week, we announced the opening of an automotive innovation center in Detroit. In these centers, we collaborate with customers and tap in to our global network of 9,500 scientists, chemists and engineers. We hear directly from our customers and deliver innovative solutions to help them gain competitive advantage. 
Overall, our transportation continues. Actions we've taken to differentially manage our portfolio are shifting us steadily towards higher growth, higher-margin businesses. Ongoing productivity, coupled with restructuring actions announced today, keep us efficient, effective and competitive. And our market-driven innovation continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, providing our customers with the innovative solutions they need to compete and creating value for our shareholders. So Karen, back to you."

We see -- we saw volumes fall there. We saw the volume decreased obviously in the quarter and expect volume and price pressure to continue in the fourth quarter. Sizing that, we have done that in terms of putting forward our guidance for the year and estimate, and the range that you've seen here is inclusive of what is a substantial decline in Performance Chemicals earnings along with the seasonal losses in Agriculture. As we look out next year, Don, we do see that there are some things moving in the favor of stabilizing forces around TiO2. If you take a look at housing market improving, what, some 21% year-over-year and the season that will come in the U.S. in the second quarter and China, which is expected to resume some infrastructure investment as they're changing government takes place. Our customer inventory levels are normalizing. And so, yes, we hope it's going to be a tough end of the year, but we see stabilization occurring in the first half of next year.

David, when you think about the proceeds, I talked to you today, about what the dollar value is now sized to be on an after-tax basis.

And the first thing we're going to do is, as I mentioned, we want to make sure we maintain that strong balance sheet. The Aa2 rating is very important to us. So strengthening that balance sheet is one of the key criteria and one of the first things we're going to be looking to do there. Subsequent to that, what we're going to be doing is looking at returning excess cash for our shareholders, as we always talked about doing, unless we have a compelling investment opportunity. That investment opportunity could be capacity increases, could be opportunities around further investments in some of the R&D work. It could be potential acquisitions. So there's a lot of ways in which that could manifest itself. The other thing is, obviously, when you think about returning value to the shareholders, the fact that we've had 432 consecutive dividends displays our commitment to the dividend program and, ultimately, more decision there as to dividend. And share buyback, you mentioned, we have active share buyback programs in place, David, and we continue to operate against those. Primary purpose there is to make sure that we don't have dilution in the earnings from any of the management options that would be exercised over the course of time."

So weather it's a delayed a quarter or whatever, what well time will tell if this marketplace played outs. But we think it solid. Your second question was around the impact of -- well, obviously, our compensation programs will be lower based on the impact of the second half of the year. I'm not sure there is materiality to the impact on our earnings from that standpoint, but those estimates will be lower as our earnings will be lower for the year."

We allow our businesses and functions to talk to their people locally, which is where those conversations should take place. So it is an overall type of thing. In the businesses, I would describe it more as a surgical in terms of looking at their value chains and making the necessary structural changes that they need, regardless of where it is in the world to react to a changing environment. And so when you think about productivity, it is kind of a funny story. We learned a lot by doing this operations from DPC that allowed us to think about how we operate from a corporate corner or an infrastructure standpoint that really enabled us to take additional action at this time, into released feline our corporate functions and support for our businesses to be much more efficient and effective in getting the necessary work done. And from a business standpoint, as you know, businesses do product lines, move businesses. Each one has the room particular cycle but some of these things are to great renewal or headroom for investments in new products and research and development in different areas. And so it's more of a renewal standpoint from them. And with the size and breadth of our product line, I think there's always going to be opportunities to do that, depending on our ability to innovate and really replace ourselves right out on the marketplace.

And if you think in example like if you think about polymers, that was in the wired few books. And that's basic to a lot. But it's not showing any progress.

North American GDP, they're expecting to grow less than 2012 due to the many uncertainties that we see at least impacting the first half of the year like the debt issues, fiscal cliff and the election outcomes. But if you take a look at the sectors where we participate add, strong fundamentals, global stocks remained tight. Prices are good from a income standpoint but they're volatility. We've got excellent momentum from our 2012 product performance and the early orders that we're seeing now for a strong 2013 strong season. Planted acres are forecasted to be very good for Brazil Safrinha and North America and so we're very focused on really delivering for the growth that we see there. Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences continued margin expansion through cost synergies, delivering on these synergies from the acquisition. You saw the kind of margin expansion we saw. We've got products in the pipeline and innovation coming. And I think we'll see continued performance improvements there. If you take a look at Performance Materials, builds our forecast would be up only 1.5% next year so 5%, 5.5% based this year but grow and our innovation centers are really helping us the penetration and these advanced polymers to that industry. So let's talk about things like Safety & Protection. The restructuring actions will take hold. We'll see savings in that segment next year that will help expand margins. In addition to U.S. housing improvement that will help bolster that. In Electronic & Communications so I've already stated PV we expect to be flat year-over-year. And improving part of that will continue to be the strength in smartphones, tablets and things. And P as we expect, the performance for TiO2 to bottom in the first half of '13 and in that longer term, TiO2 demand will continue to correlate with GDP. So overall, there's a lot of positives in the near some areas that we have to really focus on like TiO2 and really in giving PV to really work through some of their issues as they are. And so '13 is going to be going to really be determined by the macroeconomic environment and what happens from the United States coming through the election would be issues. So I think with a lot of going forward and on top of the challenges we have, we'll see there that will end."

In a few minutes, we'll walk through our results for the quarter and provide color on markets and business performance. Before we do that, I want to discuss our actions to build and deliver value for shareholders, as we sharpen our competitiveness and confront our most immediate challenges. We continue to manage the company knowing that sustained growth and competitiveness require a dynamic, agile organization that is deeply connected to customers and markets. Our businesses and corporate functions are constantly working towards that goal. This is how we step up to market challenges, outperform the competition and grow. Continuing macroeconomic uncertainty and resulting slowing demand in certain sectors are reminders of why agility and productivity must be a way of life. 
Today, we are announcing additional actions we have launched to improve competitiveness and accelerate market-driven innovation and growth by fine-tuning the organization, eliminating cost and expanding targeted productivity programs. This effort is somewhat surgical in that each of our businesses have assessed what action, if any, is warranted versus their market condition and competitive set. Our actions reflect differential management of the portfolio and not a one-size-fits-all approach. 
I'd like to underscore some of the more important elements of what we're doing. Recent transactions involving Performance Coatings and Danisco, advance DuPont's vision to be the world's most dynamic science company, with a long-term strategy of driving competitive advantage in Agriculture & Nutrition, Advanced Materials and Industrial Biotechnology, all of which represents high growth, high-margin opportunities. Over time, you will begin to see the full effect of these transactions as we redeploy capital and fully integrate Danisco and Solae, generating new growth opportunities in high-margin parts of our business. 
We set aggressive cost targets for these transactions. In the case of Danisco, we're delivering $130 million in cost synergies by year end, well ahead of the original schedule. In the case of DPC, we will eliminate $230 million in residual costs associated with the divestiture. We will take the same disciplined approach to eliminate these costs as we have in addressing the Danisco cost synergies. 
Based on what we learned during the separation process, we identified additional actions to reduce corporate costs to further simplify and streamline our global infrastructure. We are better aligning the design and cost of corporate functions with business growth strategies and the expected impact of changing market conditions. In addition, current uncertainty in the global economic outlook, softer demand in certain markets and strength in others require realigning business resources to match current growth opportunities and increase responsiveness to rapidly changing market realities. Businesses have identified cost-saving opportunities by optimizing supply chains, consolidating facilities and refining their organizations geographically to improve competitiveness and margins. It's important to recognize that these actions unlock capital, drive science-powered innovation and will deliver growth faster. In order to ensure continued competitiveness at both the function and business levels, our leaders identified actions to deliver $220 million in savings. This combines with the elimination of $230 million in residual costs for a total of $450 million in benefits. 
This restructuring work is in addition to ongoing productivity programs that address cost and working capital. All these actions are part of a continuum for DuPont, but they obviously take on particular importance given the quarter's results. Business results in the third quarter reflect continued weak market conditions in Europe and an uncertainty in Asia. The bright spots were strong performance in Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials. The most challenged segments this quarter were Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. 
Agriculture market fundamentals remained strong, supported by robust demand and a healthy outlook for farm income. You will recall, last year, this segment delivered outstanding growth in sales and earnings in Latin America. And despite such a strong third quarter comp and a 10% currency headwind, Ag sales were up 4% this quarter. We remain bullish about the growth opportunities for our Seed & Crop Protection businesses, as the Latin American planting season continues in the fourth quarter and the northern hemisphere season gets underway. And we are bullish on the solid momentum we have heading into 2013. 
On Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences segment grew 10% and 5%, respectively, when excluding currency impact. Both businesses delivered impressive earnings growth, with PTOI margin expansion of 300 basis points in the quarter. These results demonstrate the outstanding work by the businesses to deliver customer value through innovation and deliver cost synergies from the Danisco acquisition ahead of schedule. 
Performance Chemicals earnings were down 37%, which reflected earnings decline in both businesses within this segment. Weaker economic conditions, particularly in China and Europe, are reducing demand for TiO2 and fluoropolymers, specifically connected to construction and infrastructure. These businesses continue to focus on customer service, drive fixed cost and working capital productivity and, in the case of TiO2, reduced cost by shifting to lower cost or blend. 
Electronics & Communications earnings decline was essentially all related to weak photovoltaic markets and an oversupply of PV modules. Trade actions in the United States and trade investigations in the European Union add to market uncertainty and are negatively impacting demand. The bright spot in the segment was the consumer electronics market bolstered by demand for smartphones and tablets. 
Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Nick to go through third quarter financials. And after the segment reviews, I'll share perspectives on key markets going forward. Nick?"

Underlying earnings from continuing operations of $0.32 per share were down $0.28 versus the prior year. This decline reflects the market conditions that Ellen just covered, as well as $0.28 of headwinds from currency, taxes, lower pharmaceutical income, noncash pension costs and exchange losses. 
Consolidated net sales of $7.4 billion were down 9% versus the prior year. Volume declined 5% as increases in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. Volume in Asia-Pacific declined 10%, primarily due to lower TiO2 and photovoltaic materials volume. Excluding Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications, Asia-Pacific volume was up slightly year-over-year. 
Local selling prices increased 1% with declines in Asia-Pacific, partially offsetting gains in the other regions. The single largest driver for the drop in local prices in Asia-Pacific resulted from the decrease in silver cost, related to our Solamet paste, which as we've discussed with you before, it's passed through direct to the customer. For more information regarding the company's sales by geographic region, please see Slide 4. 
As Ellen mentioned earlier, today, we announced a restructuring plan, which is summarized on Slide 5. This plan will deliver total pretax cost savings of $450 million by eliminating corporate cost previously allocated to Performance Coatings, while taking additional cost-cutting actions to improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver $300 million of savings in 2013 and the full amount in 2014. 
Our targets have been established from the bottom up, with specific projects already identified and rigorous monitoring and accountability in place. To achieve these savings, we expect to record a restructuring charge of about $210 million, $152 million of this charge was recorded in the third quarter with the balance to come in quarter 4. These actions will make us a leaner, more agile company and better position all of our businesses for future growth. 
I'd like to point out that the savings associated with the restructuring plan will essentially offset the dilutive earnings effect associated with the divesting of their Performance Coatings business. And speaking of the Performance Coatings divestiture, the transaction is progressing as planned, and we expect to close the sale in the first quarter of next year. We estimate the after-tax proceeds will be about $4 billion. This is a preliminary figure, recognizing the tax calculation is complex and involve many factors that are not yet finalized. We'll provide you a final number when the sale closes. 
Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 6, which is shown on a continuing-operations basis. First, higher local selling prices resulting in a $0.05 per share benefit. Excluding currency, variable costs were a $0.17 tailwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were down about 5% versus the prior year. While we recognize these costs will be lower in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an increase of about 1% for the full year. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, our overall 5% volume decline reduced earnings by $0.15 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, excluding currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects 3% of higher noncash pension cost and a $0.02 lower plant utilizations charges, as well as higher spending on growth investments, primarily R&D and marketing initiatives in the Agricultural segment. The lower plant utilization charges did not represent increases in spending, but rather, were primarily the result of lower volumes in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. These are a fixed manufacturing cost, normally reflected in inventory that are expensed when production rates drop below normal operating levels. This helps to ensure our inventory values are not inflated. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we have delivered approximately $285 million of fixed cost productivity to date, well on our way towards exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year. I'd like to reiterate what Ellen said earlier. The restructuring plan we announced today is in addition to these ongoing productivity programs. 
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.13 variance in the quarter. As current -- at current exchange rates, we expect about $0.27 headwind for the full year on a continuing-operations basis. This equates to about a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. 
Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.02 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the extent that our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax was a $0.05 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate of 24% this quarter and 17% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in high-tax-rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of the U.S. R&D credit and other tax provisions, which expired at the end of 2011. For the full year of 2012, we expect the base tax rate on a continuing ops basis to be about 22%. 
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We continue to expect full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million or $225 million less than that in 2011. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. Third quarter free cash flow, on a total company basis, was about $250 million or $350 million less than last year. On a year-to-date basis, total company free cash flow was about $800 million lower than last year, primarily reflecting the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. Pension Plan that we made earlier this year, as well as some other onetime item payments. 
In light of our current operating environment, we have reduced our planned capital expenditures for the full year to about $1.9 billion or 10% below our previous guidance. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our Aa2 rating and work to maintain the associated metric that support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain that strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
Last month, we paid our 432nd consecutive quarterly dividend. 
In summary, for the third quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Our businesses executed well, as they faced a wide array of market conditions. Each business has externally benchmarked performance targets against which they are all executing well while outperforming their peers set. 
Turning now to the rest of the year on Slide 8. We expect the full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations to be $3.25 to $3.30 per share, excluding significant items. This outlook primarily reflects sequential lower earnings in Performance Chemicals and Agriculture in the fourth quarter versus the third. Karen will provide some more detail when she covers the segments. 
Lastly, I want to take a moment to reflect on how the recent portfolio and restructuring actions fit with our long-term strategy. The DPC divestiture, coupled with the Danisco acquisition last year, are consistent with our intent to focus on high-growth, high-margin opportunities with innovation critical to success. Today's announcement around restructuring actions will help mitigate the earnings dilution from the DPC divestiture, while positioning our businesses to be more agile and profitable long term. In addition, we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of our strong balance sheet. Our focus on our disciplined process is around innovation, productivity and differential management and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review the segments. Karen?"
268053,183073450,368116,"E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2012",2012-10-23,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Turning to Slide 9. Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals",1864,"Thanks, Nick. Turning to Slide 9. Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals. Third quarter sales of $1.4 billion grew 4%, with gains in volume and local price partially offset by currency, primarily the Brazilian real. Typical seasonal losses increased to $85 million, as sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency, continued investment in research, selling and agronomy positions in our North America and Brazil businesses and multiple product launch activities. 
Reviewing the individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $601 million were up 1%. Volume gains and insect control products and fungicides led the way with local pricing gains in all segments, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Regionally, we grew in the key markets of the United States, Latin America and Europe, overcoming the negative effects of currency. Our blockbuster insect control products powered by Rynaxypyr are on pace to grow 20% this year. In the third quarter, we successfully launched Cyazypyr insect control products in Argentina and Dermacor insect control seed treatment in Mexico. We continue to pursue registrations of these complementary insect control portfolios in additional countries and markets. In combination, these new innovative technologies derived from the same novel chemical class are on track to achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual portfolio of sales in the next few years. 
Moving to the seed business. Third quarter sales grew to $822 million, up 6%. The quarter reflected strong performance in Latin America, South Africa and South Asia. In Brazil, summer season corn sales are up despite hectares shifting from corn to soybeans. We expect pricing and share gains in summer corn, following a successful 2012 Safrinha season. These successes are result of a multiyear plan to invest in our research, production and go-to-market capabilities. Growers continue to see robust performance and insect control with our hybrids containing the Herculex 1 insect trait. This summer, we've expanded our options as we launched Optimum Intrasect in Brazil with 2 modes of action for aboveground insect control. Recent investments in soybean production and distribution capacity are also paying off, as Brazilian growers are increasing demand for locally developed, high-yielding, high-quality pioneer brand soybeans. The USDA won't issue final 2012 acreage until January of next year, so we can share some preliminary results based upon the recent October report. We held North America corn market share flat in 2012, following gains of 6 points since 2008. Double-digit pricing gains and the highest planting corn acres since 1937 resulted in significant growth in corn sales. Soybeans also experienced significant sales growth from improved price realization and higher planted acres. Soybean market share is projected to be flat to slightly down, following gains of more than 10 points since 2008. 
Finally, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which has advanced this year due to the early planting season and the widespread drought conditions. Growers planted Optimum AQUAmax on over 2 million acres in 2012. And these products performed exceptionally well. AQUAmax hybrids stayed healthier longer and, most importantly, delivered more bushels at harvest. On more than 4,000 side-by-side comparisons with competitive products, preliminary 2012 yield data shows an advantage of more than 8% with AQUAmax products in water-limited environments. 
Our Optimum AcreMax 1 and AcreMax XTRA triple-stacked hybrids, containing the Herculex rootworm trait, performed well under this year's heavy corn rootworm infestation and drought stress. We'll round out the lineup in 2013 with the addition of Optimum AcreMax XTreme, which contains dual modes of action for both above and below ground insect control. AcreMax XTreme recently received all necessary regulatory approvals for grain import into major world markets. So we look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest results in the next few weeks. 
Moving now to the segment outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect significant sales increases versus a tough prior year comp. Seasonal fourth quarter losses will be substantially larger year-over-year and about double the size of the third quarter loss, as sales growth is moderated by higher production costs, new product launches in Crop Protection & Pioneer and continued growth investments. We now expect full year margins for the segment to be about flat year-over-year, which actually is an improved outlook from earlier this year and attribute to solid execution by both businesses. 
Looking forward to 2013, the fundamentals for Agriculture remain strong, as we prepare for the upcoming Safrinha season in Brazil and the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere. Our teams are working diligently with farmers to supply them with the seeds, crop protection products and knowledge to meet the world's growing need for feed, food and renewable resources. 
Moving to Slide 10 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $607 million were down 28%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver cost pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials declined due to inventory destocking throughout the PV value chain. In addition, trade actions in the United States and investigations in Europe are creating downward pressure on end-use demand. In consumer electronics, we continue to see strong demand for our market-leading materials, fueled by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. And our packaging graphics business remained stable. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be essentially flat with a substantial earnings declined. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2011 results included a $20 million licensing payment. If we exclude this item, earnings would be up substantially. 
With respect to the photovoltaic market, we lowered our outlook for PV installations in the second half, reflecting today's market environment and pending trade actions. Our current estimate is that global PV installation rates for 2012 will be flat-to-low-single digits, depending on the fourth quarter installation rates. There are no major subsidies expiring at year-end, which has historically caused spikes in fourth quarter demand. DuPont products like Solamet and Tedlar remained industry leaders, and we are committed to our mission of being the leading supplier of differentiated materials for photovoltaics and consumer and other electronic markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $292 million were flat, as 7% volume growth was offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Volume growth occurred in all regions and reflects continued strong demand for DuPont Sorona renewably sourced polymer for carpet fiber and growth in key enzyme businesses from new product launches. PTOI of $42 million was up $8 million or 24% on higher volume and the realization of cost synergies related to the integration of the Danisco enzyme business. Enzyme sales for ethanol were significantly lower, as spreads between ethanol and corn prices continue to challenge the ethanol industry. 
Moving to the fourth quarter, we see sales up moderately and PTOI up substantially, as we continue to realize cost synergies from integration. As a result of these productivity gains and improved margins in biomaterials, full year margin is expected to be up over 3 percentage points compared to prior year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for Nutrition & Health. Strong execution in the quarter resulted in the business posting sales of $876 million, with earnings of $87 million, which are up 58%. All product lines contributed to solid 4% volume growth, led by enablers, Solae soy specialties, probiotics, cultures and sweeteners. Local pricing improved in all regions as continued mix enrichment and pricing actions, in response to key raw material increases, were offset by the negative effect of currency. Our global teams continue to focus on growing the business, while integration remains on track to deliver meaningful revenue and cost synergies. 
Our innovation and productivity mindset is evident, as full year margins will be about 10%, which is a 3-percentage-point improvement over 2011. 
Moving to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect moderate sales growth, despite the impact of currency, and substantial earnings growth, with a benefit of continued cost synergies. Sequential margins will be pressured down in the fourth quarter due to raw material inflation. 
Now, let's discuss Performance Chemicals on Slide 13. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 19% with 18% lower volume and 1% lower selling price versus an extremely tough comp in 2011. Titanium dioxide and fluoropolymer volumes were pressured by a decline in spending in infrastructure and construction in Asia Pacific and ongoing weakness in Europe. PTOI of $372 million was down 37%, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable currency. One bright spot was the continued robust demand in industrial chemicals for cyanide and aniline. Despite the weaker quarter, year-to-date segment PTOI is down only modestly when compared to last year's strong earnings performance. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down significantly and earnings down substantially. We expect continued softness, while TiO2 producers reduce existing inventory levels. On a positive note, customer inventory levels have declined from previous highs and long-term industry fundamentals remain solid. Long-term growth remains tightly correlated to GDP. So for now, we continue to stay close to customers and drive productivity. And we look for this market to bottom in the first half of next year. We see several potential triggers for recovery, including new investment in Asia infrastructure, some stability in Europe and the continued recovery and growth in the U.S. housing market. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales of $1.6 billion were down 8%, primarily due to lower selling prices and currency. Packaging volumes remained stable, and modest improvement in automotive were partially offset by unfavorable currency and softness in Asia-Pacific electronic markets. PTOI of $306 million increased $75 million on value pricing, lower feedstock costs and positive mix. Continuing productivity efforts also contributed to margin expansion. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down modestly, with global auto builds flat and continued soft demand in industrial and electronics markets. We expect PTOI to be up substantially versus weak comps on lower costs and value pricing. 
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales declined 7% on 4% lower selling prices due to unfavorable currency and 3% lower volume. The volume decline was primarily due to stalled infrastructure projects in China, weaker industrial conditions in Europe and the U.S. Military delaying tender on orders. PTOI was down 13% primarily due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. 
For the fourth quarter, sales are expected to be essentially flat. We see continued softness in industrial markets and inconsistent spending in the public sector. With the continued new home construction rebound in the U.S., we are seeing a pickup in sales of Tyvek HomeWrap. While this is off a very small base and we do not foresee this being a big needle mover in the near term, we expect the increased demand in this market will continue into 2013. Fourth quarter PTOI is expected to be down moderately due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. Going forward, S&P will see significant productivity improvement in future years from the restructuring plan that we announced today. 
So with that, I conclude the segment update and turn the call over for Ellen."

Staying ahead of market trends and taking action to position ourselves well for what lies ahead are cornerstones of how we operate. As we head into the fourth quarter and beyond, we are laser-focused on those principles that keep us competitive and drive our growth. We continue to execute well in most parts of the company. And certain segments such as Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials are outperforming despite market volatility and soft macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing our challenges head-on. We must continue to stay close to customers. We do this routinely to understand their needs and develop new products that capitalize fully on market rebound and support attractive margins. This connection is also how we gain insight on demand signals, which is critically important when markets are volatile. Our focus on market-driven innovation and the new products we deliver are intrinsic to several opportunities we see for growth, heading into next year. 
First, our Agriculture business is poised to pay us $10 billion in sales this year. We're heading into 2013 with strong momentum. We've made tremendous progress in our Seed Genetics and our Crop Protection pipeline over the past decade and been rewarded with market share and excellent growth in the U.S. and internationally. And this includes very attractive returns. Everything is in place to continue that track record next year. 
Second, 2013 is a foundational year for some of the important long-term growth opportunities in industrial biotechnologies and OLED. There are short-term milestones to watch for in these areas that include breaking ground on a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant and steps that we and our partners take to scale up, validate and move closer to commercialization of DuPont OLED technology. 
A third opportunity for innovation is in automotive where market continues to recover, and we're aggressively building on our strong presence. In July, we announced an expansion of our successful innovation center in Nagoya, Japan; and last week, we announced the opening of an automotive innovation center in Detroit. In these centers, we collaborate with customers and tap in to our global network of 9,500 scientists, chemists and engineers to hear directly from our customers and deliver innovative solutions to help them gain competitive advantage. 
Overall, our transformation continues. Actions we've taken to differentially manage our portfolio are shifting us steadily towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Ongoing productivity, coupled with restructuring actions announced today, keep us efficient, effective and competitive. And our market-driven innovation continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, providing our customers with the innovative solutions they need to compete and creating value for our shareholders. 
So Karen, back to you."

Sizing that, we have done that in terms of putting forward our guidance for the year and estimate, and the range that you've seen here is inclusive of what is a substantial decline in Performance Chemicals earnings along with the seasonal losses in Agriculture. As we look out next year, Don, we do see that there are some things moving in the favor of stabilizing forces around TiO2. If you take a look at housing market improving, what, some 21% year-over-year and the season that will come in the U.S. in the second quarter and China, which is expected to resume some infrastructure investment as they're changing government takes place. Customer inventory levels are normalizing. And so, yes, it's going to be a tough end of the year, but we see stabilization occurring in the first half of next year.

David, when you think about the proceeds, I talked to you today, about what the dollar value is now sized to be on an after-tax basis.

And the first thing we're going to do is, as I mentioned, we want to make sure we maintain that strong balance sheet. The Aa2 rating is very important to us. So strengthening that balance sheet is one of the key criteria and one of the first things we're going to be looking to do there. Subsequent to that, what we're going to be doing is looking at returning excess cash to our shareholders, as we always talk about doing, unless we have a compelling investment opportunity. That investment opportunity could be capacity increases, could be opportunities around further investments in some of the R&D work. It could be potential acquisitions. So there's a lot of ways in which that could manifest itself. The other thing is, obviously, when you think about returning value to the shareholders, the fact that we've had 432 consecutive dividends displays our commitment to the dividend program and, ultimately, board decision there as to dividend. And share buyback, you mentioned, we have active share buyback programs in place, David, and we continue to operate against those.

This is a business in the market that we evaluate those and bring them on in a very disciplined manner, and we'll continue to gauge the market in that. But we're committed to those expansions and I think that they'll serve us well over the long term, because continued demand at TiO2 is going to continue to grow at about GDP. So whether it's a delayed a quarter or whatever, what time will tell as this marketplace plays out. But we think it solid. Your second question was around the impact of -- well, obviously, our compensation programs will be lower based on the impact of the second half of the year.

So if you think about even the residual cost from DPC, that residual cost resides in every region of the world and we're not -- we don't size it by geography. We allow our businesses and functions to talk to their people locally, which is where those conversations should take place. So it is an overall type of thing. In the businesses, I would describe it more as a surgical in terms of looking at their value chains and making the necessary structural changes that they need, regardless of where it is in the world to react to a changing environment. And so when you think about productivity, it is kind of a funny story. We learned a lot by doing the separation from DPC that allowed us to think about how we operate from a corporate core and infrastructure standpoint that really enabled us to take additional action at this time, and to really streamline our corporate functions and support for our businesses to be much more efficient and effective in getting the necessary work done. And from a business standpoint, as you know, businesses do -- product lines move businesses. Each one has their own particular cycle but some of these things are to create renewal or headroom for investments in new products and research & development in different areas. And so it's more of a renewal standpoint from them. And with the size and breadth of our product line, I think there's always going to be opportunities to do that, depending on our ability to innovate and really replace ourselves right out in that marketplace. So it is about getting back to focusing on creating momentum, streamlining the headquarters and the corporate staff and really allowing the businesses to respond very agilely in a very uncertain environment."

But if you think about housing, commercial construction and residential construction are not providing any lift from a China standpoint. And if you think in example, like if you think about fluoropolymer, that was in the wired cable. And that's basic to a lot. But it's not showing any progress. And so it impacts a lot of different industrial, transportation and construction type of market. So I mean the bright spot we see in Chinese is automotive and Nutrition & Health and Agriculture. And those are the 3 areas that we continue to see movement in. But on the industrial side or the construction side, we don't see any meaningful activity."

So if you talk to our economist, they're projecting it to be -- GDP to be a little lower than '13 than it is this year. Western Europe, 0. Asia growth everybody pegs it comparable to '12, but I think it's very different depending on sector. North American GDP, they're expecting to grow less than 2012 due to the many uncertainties that we see at least impacting the first half of the year like the debt issues, fiscal cliffs and the election outcomes. But if you take a look at the sectors where we participate Ag strong fundamentals, global stocks remained tight. Prices are good from a farm income standpoint but they're volatility. We've got excellent momentum from our 2012 product performance in the early orders that we're seeing now for a strong 2013 strong season. Planted acres are forecasted to be very good for Brazil Safrinha and North America and so we're very focused on really delivering for the growth that we see there. Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences continued margin expansion through cost synergies, delivering on these synergies from the acquisition. You saw the kind of margin expansion we saw. They got new products in the pipeline and innovation coming. And I think we'll see continued performance improvements there. If you take a look at Performance Materials, auto builds are forecast may be only 1%, 1.5% next year. So off its 5%, 5.5% base this year but growth. And our innovation centers are really helping us with penetration on these advanced polymers into that industry. So, let's talk about things like Safety & Protection. The restructuring actions will take hold. We'll see savings in that segment next year that will help expand margins. In addition to U.S. housing improvement that will help bolster up then. In Electronic & Communications, I've already stated that on PV, we expect it to be flat year-over-year. And the improving part of that will continue to be the strength in smartphones, tablets and things. And PChem, as we said, we expect the performance chemicals, the TiO2 market, to bottom in the first half of '13. In that longer term, TiO2 demand will continue to correlate with GDP. So overall, there's a lot of positives in the near some areas that we have to really focus on like TiO2 and really in getting PV to really work through some of their issues as they are. And so '13 is going to be -- going to really be determined by the macroeconomic environment and what happens from the United States coming through the election with these issues. So I think we've got a lot of strength going with us forward and we're on top of the challenges we have to see where that will end."

In a few minutes, we'll walk through our results for the quarter and provide color on markets and business performance. Before we do that, I want to discuss our actions to build and deliver value for shareholders, as we sharpen our competitiveness and confront our most immediate challenges. We continue to manage the company knowing that sustained growth and competitiveness require a dynamic, agile organization that is deeply connected to customers and markets. Our businesses and corporate functions are constantly working towards that goal. This is how we step up to market challenges, outperform the competition and grow. Continuing macroeconomic uncertainty and resulting slowing demand in certain sectors are reminders of why agility and productivity must be a way of life. 
Today, we are announcing additional actions we have launched to improve competitiveness and accelerate market-driven innovation and growth by fine-tuning the organization, eliminating cost and expanding targeted productivity programs. This effort is somewhat surgical in that each of our businesses have assessed what action, if any, is warranted versus their market condition and competitive set. Our actions reflect differential management of the portfolio and not a one-size-fits-all approach. 
I'd like to underscore some of the more important elements of what we're doing. Recent transactions involving Performance Coatings and Danisco advance DuPont's vision to be the world's most dynamic science company, with a long-term strategy of driving competitive advantage in Agriculture & Nutrition, Advanced Materials and Industrial Biotechnology, all of which represent high growth, high-margin opportunities. Over time, you will begin to see the full effect of these transactions as we redeploy capital and fully integrate Danisco and Solae, generating new growth opportunities in high-margin parts of our business. 
We set aggressive cost targets for these transactions. In the case of Danisco, we're delivering $130 million in cost synergies by year end, well ahead of the original schedule. In the case of DPC, we will eliminate $230 million in residual costs associated with the divestiture. We will take the same disciplined approach to eliminate these costs as we have in addressing the Danisco cost synergies. 
Based on what we learned during the separation process, we identified additional actions to reduce corporate costs to further simplify and streamline our global infrastructure. We are better aligning the design and cost of corporate functions with business growth strategies and the expected impact of changing market conditions. In addition, current uncertainty in the global economic outlook, softer demand in certain markets and strength in others require realigning business resources to match current growth opportunities and increase responsiveness to rapidly changing market realities. Businesses have identified cost-saving opportunities by optimizing supply chains, consolidating facilities and refining their organizations geographically to improve competitiveness and margins. It's important to recognize that these actions unlock capital, drive science-powered innovation and will deliver growth faster. In order to ensure continued competitiveness at both the function and business levels, our leaders identified actions to deliver $220 million in savings. This combines with the elimination of $230 million in residual costs for a total of $450 million in benefits. 
This restructuring work is in addition to ongoing productivity programs that address cost and working capital. All these actions are part of a continuum for DuPont, but they obviously take on particular importance given the quarter's results. Business results in the third quarter reflect continued weak market conditions in Europe and uncertainty in Asia. The bright spots were strong performance in Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials. The most challenged segments this quarter were Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. 
Agriculture market fundamentals remained strong, supported by robust demand and a healthy outlook for farm income. You will recall, last year, this segment delivered outstanding growth in sales and earnings in Latin America. And despite such a strong third quarter comp and a 10% currency headwind, Ag sales were up 4% this quarter. We remain bullish about the growth opportunities for our Seed & Crop Protection businesses, as the Latin American planting season continues in the fourth quarter and the northern hemisphere season gets underway. And we are bullish on the solid momentum we have heading into 2013. 
Our Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences segment grew 10% and 5%, respectively, when excluding currency impact. Both businesses delivered impressive earnings growth, with PTOI margin expansion of 300 basis points in the quarter. These results demonstrate outstanding work by the businesses to deliver customer value through innovation and deliver cost synergies from the Danisco acquisition ahead of schedule. 
Performance Chemicals earnings were down 37%, which reflected earnings decline in both businesses within the segment. Weaker economic conditions, particularly in China and Europe, are reducing demand for TiO2 and fluoropolymers, specifically connected to construction and infrastructure. These businesses continue to focus on customer service, drive fixed cost and working capital productivity and, in the case of TiO2, reduce cost by shifting to lower cost or blends. 
Electronics & Communications earnings decline was essentially all related to weak photovoltaic markets and an oversupply of PV modules. Trade actions in the United States and trade investigations in the European Union add to market uncertainty and are negatively impacting demand. The bright spot in the segment was the consumer electronics market bolstered by demand for smartphones and tablets. 
Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Nick to go through third quarter financials. And after the segment reviews, I'll share perspectives on key markets going forward. Nick?"

Underlying earnings from continuing operations of $0.32 per share were down $0.28 versus the prior year. This decline reflects the market conditions that Ellen just covered, as well as $0.28 of headwinds from currency, taxes, lower pharmaceutical income, noncash pension costs and exchange losses. 
Consolidated net sales of $7.4 billion were down 9% versus the prior year. Volume declined 5% as increases in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. Volume in Asia-Pacific declined 10%, primarily due to lower TiO2 and photovoltaic materials volume. Excluding Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications, Asia-Pacific volume was up slightly year-over-year. 
Local selling prices increased 1% with declines in Asia-Pacific partially offsetting gains in the other regions. The single largest driver for the drop in local prices in Asia-Pacific resulted from the decrease in silver cost, related to our Solamet paste, which as we've discussed with you before, is passed through direct to the customer. For more information regarding the company's sales by geographic region, please see Slide 4. 
As Ellen mentioned earlier, today, we announced a restructuring plan, which is summarized on Slide 5. This plan will deliver total pretax cost savings of $450 million by eliminating corporate cost previously allocated to Performance Coatings, while taking additional cost-cutting actions to improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver $300 million of savings in 2013 and the full amount in 2014. 
Our targets have been established from the bottom up, with specific projects already identified and rigorous monitoring and accountability in place. To achieve these savings, we expect to record a restructuring charge of about $210 million; $152 million of this charge was recorded in the third quarter with the balance to come in quarter 4. These actions will make us a leaner, more agile company and better position all of our businesses for future growth. 
I'd like to point out that the savings associated with the restructuring plan will essentially offset the dilutive earnings effect associated with the divesting of the Performance Coatings business. And speaking of the Performance Coatings divestiture, the transaction is progressing as planned, and we expect to close the sale in the first quarter of next year. We estimate the after-tax proceeds will be about $4 billion. This is a preliminary figure, recognizing the tax calculation is complex and involves many factors that are not yet finalized. We'll provide you a final number when the sale closes. 
Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 6, which is shown on a continuing-operations basis. First, higher local selling prices resulting in a $0.05 per share benefit. Excluding currency, variable costs were a $0.17 tailwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were down about 5% versus the prior year. While we recognize these costs will be lower in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an increase of about 1% for the full year. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, our overall 5% volume decline reduced earnings by $0.15 per share. 
Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, excluding currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects 3% of higher noncash pension cost and a $0.02 lower plant utilization charges, as well as higher spending on growth investments, primarily R&D and marketing initiatives in the Agricultural segment. The lower plant utilization charges did not represent increases in spending, but rather, were primarily the result of lower volumes in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. These are a fixed manufacturing cost, normally reflected in inventory that are expensed when production rates drop below normal operating levels. This helps to ensure our inventory values are not inflated. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we have delivered approximately $285 million of fixed cost productivity to date, well on our way towards exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year. I'd like to reiterate what Ellen said earlier. The restructuring plan we announced today is in addition to these ongoing productivity programs. 
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.13 variance in the quarter. As current -- at current exchange rates, we expect about $0.27 headwind for the full year on a continuing-operations basis. This equates to about a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. 
Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.02 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the extent that our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. 
Income tax was a $0.05 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate of 24% this quarter and 17% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in high tax-rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of the U.S. R&D credit and other tax provisions, which expired at the end of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect the base tax rate on a continuing ops basis to be about 22%. 
Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We continue to expect full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million or $225 million less than that in 2011. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. Third quarter free cash flow, on a total company basis, was about $250 million or $350 million less than last year. On a year-to-date basis, total company free cash flow was about $800 million lower than last year, primarily reflecting the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. Pension Plan that we made earlier this year, as well as some other onetime item payments. 
In light of our current operating environment, we have reduced our planned capital expenditures for the full year to about $1.9 billion or 10% below our previous guidance. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A/A2 rating and work to maintain the associated metrics that support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
Last month, we paid our 432nd consecutive quarterly dividend. 
In summary, for the third quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Our businesses executed well, as they faced a wide array of market conditions. Each business has externally benchmarked performance targets against which they are all executing well while outperforming their peer set. 
Turning now to the rest of the year on Slide 8. We expect the full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations to be $3.25 to $3.30 per share, excluding significant items. This outlook primarily reflects sequential lower earnings in Performance Chemicals and Agriculture in the fourth quarter versus the third. Karen will provide some more detail when she covers the segments. 
Lastly, I want to take a moment to reflect on how the recent portfolio and restructuring actions fit with our long-term strategy. The DPC divestiture, coupled with the Danisco acquisition last year, are consistent with our intent to focus on high-growth, high-margin opportunities with innovation critical to success. Today's announcement around restructuring actions will help mitigate the earnings dilution from the DPC divestiture, while positioning our businesses to be more agile and profitable long term. In addition, we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of our strong balance sheet. Our focus on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review the segments. Karen."

Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals",1869,"Thanks, Nick. Turning to Slide 9. Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals. Third quarter sales of $1.4 billion grew 4%, with gains in volume and local price partially offset by currency, primarily the Brazilian real. Typical seasonal losses increased to $85 million, as sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency, continued investment in research, selling and agronomy positions in our North America and Brazil businesses and multiple product launch activities. 
Reviewing the individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $601 million were up 1%. Volume gains and insect control products and fungicides led the way with local pricing gains in all segments, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Regionally, we grew in the key markets of the United States, Latin America and Europe, overcoming the negative effects of currency. Our blockbuster insect control products powered by Rynaxypyr are on pace to grow 20% this year. In the third quarter, we successfully launched Cyazypyr insect control products in Argentina and Dermacor insect control seed treatment in Mexico. We continue to pursue registrations of these complementary insect control portfolios in additional countries and markets. In combination, these new innovative technologies derived from the same novel chemical class are on track to achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual portfolio of sales in the next few years. 
Moving to the seed business. Third quarter sales grew to $822 million, up 6%. The quarter reflected strong performance in Latin America, South Africa and South Asia. In Brazil, summer season corn sales are up despite hectares shifting from corn to soybeans. We expect pricing and share gains in summer corn, following a successful 2012 Safrinha season. These successes are the result of a multiyear plan to invest in our research, production and go-to-market capabilities. Growers continue to see robust performance and insect control with our hybrids containing the Herculex 1 insect trait. This summer, we've expanded grower options as we launched Optimum Intrasect in Brazil with 2 modes of action for aboveground insect control. Recent investments in soybean production and distribution capacity are also paying off, as Brazilian growers are increasing demand for locally developed, high-yielding, high-quality pioneer brand soybeans. The USDA won't issue final 2012 acreage until January of next year, so we can share some preliminary results based upon the recent October report. We held North America corn market share flat in 2012, following gains of 6 points since 2008. Double-digit pricing gains and the highest planting corn acres since 1937 resulted in significant growth in corn sales. Soybeans also experienced significant sales growth from improved price realization and higher planted acres. Soybean market share is projected to be flat to slightly down, following gains of more than 10 points since 2008. 
Finally, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which has advanced this year due to the early planting season and the widespread drought conditions. Growers planted Optimum AQUAmax on over 2 million acres in 2012. And these products performed exceptionally well. AQUAmax hybrids stayed healthier longer and, most importantly, delivered more bushels at harvest. On more than 4,000 side-by-side comparisons with competitive products, preliminary 2012 yield data shows an advantage of more than 8% with AQUAmax products in water-limited environments. 
Our Optimum AcreMax 1 and AcreMax XTRA triple-stacked hybrids, containing the Herculex rootworm trait, performed well under this year's heavy corn rootworm infestation and drought stress. We'll round out the lineup in 2013 with the addition of Optimum AcreMax XTreme, which contains dual modes of action for both above- and below-ground insect control. AcreMax XTreme recently received all necessary regulatory approvals for grain import into major world markets. So we look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest results in the next few weeks. 
Moving now to the segment outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect significant sales increases versus a tough prior year comp. Seasonal fourth quarter losses will be substantially larger year-over-year and about double the size of the third quarter loss, as sales growth is moderated by higher production costs, new product launches in Crop Protection & Pioneer and continued growth investments. We now expect full year margins for the segment to be about flat year-over-year, which actually is an improved outlook from earlier this year and a tribute to solid execution by both businesses. 
Looking forward to 2013, the fundamentals for Agriculture remains strong, as we prepare for the upcoming Safrinha season in Brazil and the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere. Our teams are working diligently with farmers to supply them with the seeds, crop protection products and knowledge to meet the world's growing need for feed, food and renewable resources. 
Moving to Slide 10 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $607 million were down 28%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver cost pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials declined due to inventory destocking throughout the PV value chain. In addition, trade actions in the United States and investigations in Europe are creating downward pressure on end-use demand. In consumer electronics, we continue to see strong demand for our market-leading materials, fueled by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. And our packaging graphics business remains stable. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be essentially flat with a substantial earnings decline. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2011 results included a $20 million licensing payment. If we exclude this item, earnings would be up substantially. 
With respect to the photovoltaic market, we lowered our outlook for PV installations in the second half, reflecting today's market environment and pending trade actions. Our current estimate is that global PV installation rates for 2012 will be flat to low single digits, depending on the fourth quarter installation rates. There are no major subsidies expiring at year-end, which has historically caused spikes in fourth quarter demand. DuPont products like Solamet and Tedlar remained industry leaders, and we are committed to our mission of being the leading supplier of differentiated materials for photovoltaics and consumer and other electronic markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $292 million were flat, as 7% volume growth was offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Volume growth occurred in all regions and reflects continued strong demand for DuPont Sorona renewably sourced polymer for carpet fiber and growth in key enzyme businesses from new product launches. PTOI of $42 million was up $8 million or 24% on higher volume and the realization of cost synergies related to the integration of the Danisco enzyme business. Enzyme sales for ethanol were significantly lower, as spreads between ethanol and corn prices continue to challenge the ethanol industry. 
Moving to the fourth quarter, we see sales up moderately and PTOI up substantially, as we continue to realize cost synergies from integration. As a result of these productivity gains and improved margins in biomaterials, full year margin is expected to be up over 3 percentage points compared to prior year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for Nutrition & Health. Strong execution in the quarter resulted in the business posting sales of $876 million, with earnings of $87 million, which are up 58%. All product lines contributed to solid 4% volume growth, led by enablers, Solae soy specialties, probiotics, cultures and sweeteners. Local pricing improved in all regions as continued mix enrichment and pricing actions, in response to key raw material increases, were offset by the negative effect of currency. Our global teams continue to focus on growing the business, while integration remains on track to deliver meaningful revenue and cost synergies. 
Our innovation and productivity mindset is evident, as full year margins will be about 10%, which is a 3 percentage-point improvement over 2011. 
Moving to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect moderate sales growth, despite the impact of currency, and substantial earnings growth, with the benefit of continued cost synergies. Sequential margins will be pressured down in the fourth quarter due to raw material inflation. 
Now, let's discuss Performance Chemicals on Slide 13. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 19% with 18% lower volume and 1% lower selling price versus an extremely tough comp in 2011. Titanium dioxide and fluoropolymer volumes were pressured by a decline in spending in infrastructure and construction in Asia-Pacific and ongoing weakness in Europe. PTOI of $372 million was down 37%, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable currency. One bright spot was the continued robust demand in industrial chemicals for cyanide and aniline. Despite the weaker quarter, year-to-date segment PTOI is down only modestly when compared to last year's strong earnings performance. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down significantly and earnings down substantially. We expect continued softness, while TiO2 producers reduce existing inventory levels. On a positive note, customer inventory levels have declined from previous highs and long-term industry fundamentals remain solid. Long-term growth remains tightly correlated to GDP. So for now, we continue to stay close to customers and drive productivity. And we look for this market to bottom in the first half of next year. We see several potential triggers for recovery, including new investment in Asia infrastructure, some stability in Europe and the continued recovery and growth in the U.S. housing market. 
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales of $1.6 billion were down 8%, primarily due to lower selling prices and currency. Packaging volumes remained stable, and modest improvement in automotive were partially offset by unfavorable currency and softness in Asia-Pacific electronic markets. PTOI of $306 million increased $75 million on value pricing, lower feedstock costs and positive mix. Continuing productivity efforts also contributed to margin expansion. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down modestly, with global auto builds flat and continued soft demand in industrial and electronics markets. We expect PTOI to be up substantially versus weak comps on lower costs and value pricing. 
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales declined 7% on 4% lower selling prices due to unfavorable currency and 3% lower volume. The volume decline was primarily due to stalled infrastructure projects in China, weaker industrial conditions in Europe and the U.S. Military delaying tender on orders. PTOI was down 13% primarily due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. 
For the fourth quarter, sales are expected to be essentially flat. We see continued softness in industrial markets and inconsistent spending in the public sector. With the continued new home construction rebound in the U.S., we are seeing a pickup in sales of Tyvek HomeWrap. While this is off a very small base and we do not foresee this being a big needle mover in the near term, we expect the increased demand in this market will continue into 2013. Fourth quarter PTOI is expected to be down moderately due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. Going forward, S&P will see significant productivity improvement in the future years from the restructuring plan that we announced today. 
So with that, I conclude the segment update and turn the call over for Ellen."

Staying ahead of market trends and taking action to position ourselves well for what lies ahead are cornerstones of how we operate. As we head into the fourth quarter and beyond, we are laser-focused on those principles that keep us competitive and drive our growth. We continue to execute well in most parts of the company. And certain segments such as Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials are outperforming despite market volatility and soft macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing our challenges head-on. We must continue to stay close to customers. We do this routinely to understand their needs and develop new products that capitalize fully on market rebound and support attractive margins. This connection is also how we gain insight on demand signals, which is critically important when markets are volatile. Our focus on market-driven innovation and the new products we deliver are intrinsic to several opportunities we see for growth, heading into next year. 
First, our Agriculture business is poised to pay us $10 billion in sales this year. We're heading into 2013 with strong momentum. We've made tremendous progress in our Seed Genetics and our Crop Protection pipeline over the past decade and been rewarded with market share and excellent growth in the U.S. and internationally. And this includes very attractive returns. Everything is in place to continue that track record next year. 
Second, 2013 is a foundational year for some of the important long-term growth opportunities in industrial biotechnologies and OLED. There are short-term milestones to watch for in these areas that include breaking ground on a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant and steps that we and our partners take to scale up, validate and move closer to commercialization of DuPont OLED technology. 
A third opportunity for innovation is in automotive where markets continue to recover, and we're aggressively building on our strong presence. In July, we announced an expansion of our successful innovation center in Nagoya, Japan; and last week, we announced the opening of an automotive innovation center in Detroit. In these centers, we collaborate with customers and tap in to our global network of 9,500 scientists, chemists and engineers to hear directly from our customers and deliver innovative solutions to help them gain competitive advantage. 
Overall, our transformation continues. Actions we've taken to differentially manage our portfolio are shifting us steadily towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Ongoing productivity, coupled with restructuring actions announced today, keep us efficient, effective and competitive. And our market-driven innovation continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, providing our customers with the innovative solutions they need to compete and creating value for our shareholders. 
So Karen, back to you."

Sizing that, we have done that in terms of putting forward our guidance for the year-end estimate, and the range that you've seen there is inclusive of what is a substantial decline in Performance Chemicals earnings along with the seasonal losses in Agriculture. As we look out next year, Don, we do see that there are some things moving in the favor of stabilizing forces around TiO2. If you take a look at housing market improving, what, some 21% year-over-year and the season that will come in the U.S. in the second quarter and China, which is expected to resume some infrastructure investment as they're changing government takes place. Customer inventory levels are normalizing. And so, yes, it's going to be a tough end of the year, but we see stabilization occurring in the first half of next year.

So strengthening that balance sheet is one of the key criteria and one of the first things we're going to be looking to do there. Subsequent to that, what we're going to be doing is looking at returning excess cash to our shareholders, as we always talk about doing, unless we have a compelling investment opportunity. That investment opportunity could be capacity increases, could be opportunities around further investments in some of the R&D work. It could be potential acquisitions. So there's a lot of ways in which that could manifest itself. The other thing is, obviously, when you think about returning value to the shareholders, the fact that we've had 432 consecutive dividends displays our commitment to the dividend program and, ultimately, board decision there as to dividend. And share buyback, you mentioned, we have active share buyback programs in place, David, and we continue to operate against those.

It's ways that we're going to drive to achieve those long-term margins that we realized or that we projected as the market continues to come back for us. On the polymer side, I think what you're probably referring to is the impairment charge there and that was a $92 million impairment charge and this related to our neoprene facility. This is a product that supplied into the industrial polymers sector of belts for mining industry, that type of thing. And what we've seen there is margins deteriorating, pricing under pressure, raw material increases and those market conditions resulted in us taking that impairment of $92 million in the quarter."

The impact of the restructuring hit all regions of the world. So if you think about even the residual cost from DPC, that residual cost resides in every region of the world and we're not -- we don't size it by geography. We allow our businesses and functions to talk to their people locally, which is where those conversations should take place. So it is an overall type of thing. In the businesses, I would describe it more as surgical in terms of looking at their value change and making the necessary structural changes that they need, regardless of where it is in the world, to react to a changing environment. And so when you think about productivity, it is kind of a funny story. We learned a lot by doing the separation from DPC that allowed us to think about how we operate from a corporate core and infrastructure standpoint that really enabled us to take additional action at this time, and to really streamline our corporate functions and support for our businesses to be much more efficient and effective in getting the necessary work done. And from a business standpoint, as you know, businesses do -- product lines move businesses. Each one has their own particular cycle but some of these things are to create renewal or headroom for investments in new products and research & development in different areas. And so it's more of a renewal standpoint from them. And with the size and breadth of our product line, I think there's always going to be opportunities to do that, depending on our ability to innovate and really replace ourselves right out in that marketplace. So it is about getting back to focusing on creating momentum, streamlining the headquarters and the corporate staff and really allowing the businesses to respond very agilely in a very uncertain environment."

And if you take an example, like if you think about fluoropolymer, that goes into wire cable. And that's basic to a lot. But it's not showing any progress. And so it impacts a lot of different industrial, transportation and construction type of markets. I mean the bright spot we see in Chinese is automotive and Nutrition & Health and Agriculture. And those are the 3 areas that we continue to see movement in. But on the industrial side or the construction side, we don't see any meaningful activity."

So if you talk to our economists, they're projecting it to be -- GDP to be a little lower at '13 than it is this year. Western Europe, 0. Asia growth, everybody pegs it comparable to '12, but I think it's very different depending on sector. North American GDP, they're expecting to grow less than 2012 due to the many uncertainties that we see at least impacting the first half of the year, like the debt issues, fiscal cliffs and the election outcome. But if you take a look at the sectors where we participate, Ag’s strong fundamentals, global stocks remain tight. Prices are good from a farm income standpoint but they're volatility. We've got excellent momentum from our 2012 product performance and the early orders that we're seeing now for a strong 2013 strong season. Planted acres are forecasted to be very good for Brazil Safrinha and North America and so we're very focused on really delivering for the growth that we see there. Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences continued margin expansion through cost synergies, delivering on the synergies from the acquisition. You saw the kind of margin expansion we saw. They got new products in the pipeline and innovation coming. And I think we'll see continued performance improvements there. If you take a look at Performance Materials, auto builds are forecast to be up maybe only 1%, 1.5% next year. So off its 5%, 5.5% base this year but growth. And our innovation centers are really helping us with penetration on these advanced polymers into that industry. So let's talk about things like Safety & Protection. The restructuring actions will take hold. We'll see savings in that segment next year that will help expand margins, in addition to U.S. housing improvement that will help bolster up them. In Electronic & Communications, I've already stated that a PV, we expect it to be flat year-over-year. And the improving part of that will continue to be the strength in smartphones, tablets and things. And PChem, as we said, we expect the performance chemicals, the TiO2 market, to bottom in the first half of '13, and that longer term, TiO2 demand will continue to correlate with GDP. So overall, there's a lot of positives and then there’s some areas that we have to really focus on like TiO2 and really in getting PV to really work through some of their issues, as they are. And so '13 is going to be -- going to really be determined by the macroeconomic environment and what happens from the United States coming through the election with these issues. So I think we've got a lot of strength going with us forward and we're on top of the challenges we have to see where that will end."
