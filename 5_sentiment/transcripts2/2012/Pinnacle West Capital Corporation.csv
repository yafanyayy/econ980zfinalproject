I’d like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Vice President of Rates and Regulation is also here with us.
Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K filed this morning. Please note that slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Our 2011 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 2.
At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.

The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide four. First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will discuss our 2011 full year r",1361,"Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide four. First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will discuss our 2011 full year results provide. Third, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. And lastly, I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, for this year’s fourth quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $13 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with net income of $7 million, or $0.07 per share for the prior year’s fourth quarter.
Our ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share. For the 2011 fourth quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $12 million, or $0.11 per share, versus ongoing earnings of $5 million, or $0.05 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide six contains a reconciliation of our fourth quarter 2011 and 2010 GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings. The amounts for both quarters exclude the results related to our discontinued operations. The discontinued operations amounts relate primarily to APS Energy Services, part of which were sold in mid-2010 and the remainder of which was sold in mid-2011. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.
Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.05 per share, compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower operations and maintenance expenses improved earnings by $0.06 per share. The decrease largely reflects lower power plant maintenance costs as a result of more work being completed earlier in the year than in
2010, as well as lower employee benefit costs. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, or RES, energy efficiency, and similar regulatory programs, which are offset by comparable revenue amounts.
Third, the impact of all other items increased earnings by $0.01 per share. These favourable variances were partially offset by the absence of tax benefits of $0.06 per share that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Turning to slide eight and the composition of the net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated electricity gross margin was up $0.05 per share, compared with the 2010 quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The retail transmission cost adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1 of 2011 raised revenue by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenues pursuant to the 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share. The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.02 per share. Lastly, the non-cash mark-to-market valuation of APS’ fuel and purchase power hedges, net of the related power supply adjustor or PSA deferrals, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share compared with the year ago.
For your reference, our mark-to-market amounts by quarter for the past couple of years are shown in the appendix slide. 
Putting this all in context for earnings, let’s look at our full year comparison on slide nine. On a GAAP basis, for the year 2011 as a whole, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $339 million or $3.09 per share compared with net income of $350 million or $3.27 per share for 2010. Our ongoing earnings for 2011 were $2.99 per share compared with $3.03 per share in 2010. 
Our 2011 earnings exceeded our earnings guidance. We had projected ongoing earnings would be near the top of our guidance range of $2.75 to $2.90. The actual results were due in part to lower O&M costs than previously projected and colder than normal fourth quarter weather. Our cost management efforts companywide continued to control our O&M and other costs. Our guidance was based on normal weather, so the colder weather increased retail sales above our previous projections.
As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS’ pending rate case. However, to assess with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today’s slides.
We understand pensions are an important topic for the financial community at this time. To address that concern, I will give you a few of our pension statistics. Our pre-tax pension cost towards the O&M was $29 million in 2011, net of the deferral under the 2009 retail rate settlement. We expect our annual pension expense to increase only about $5 million a year over the next couple of years. 
Also, in spite of market conditions, our pension plan earned 9.4% in 2011. Looking at our pension funding status, we estimate that our plan is 85% funded as calculated under the RES requirements. We did not make a contribution to the plan in 2011, and we currently anticipate contributing $65 million in 2012. All in all, we feel good about our pension expense and the funding outlook and status of the plan.
Turning to slide 10 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the fourth quarter although modestly. As shown on the slide 10, growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both solidly ahead of the prior year’s level. The rate of growth has moderated slightly from earlier in this in the year but the trend remains positive.
Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also showed steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven. All in all, these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contain with. Unemployment remains too high and the vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate are only marginally lower than our pace in 2010.
One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand trend for industrial space in metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from our peak but other sectors are seen only slow absorption of excess space. We believe the situation will continue restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years. 
APS’ customer base grew 0.4% in 2011 while retail sales increased 0.6% after reflecting the effects of the company synergy efficiency programs but excluding weather variations. Over the long term, though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve. 
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average 1.6% for 2012 through 2014 as growth accelerates during that timeframe. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 to 2014, primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Lastly, I want to comment on our liquidity and financing. APS ended the fourth quarter with no short-term debt outstanding and has ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as to the debt capital markets.
Last month, APS issued $325 million of 30 years senior unsecured notes at 4.5%. To date, we believe this is the lowest interest rate on record ever for an S&P BBB rated corporate issuance in the utilities space. I believe the record interest rate and a strong demand for the notes speak highly to the progress we have made over the last three years. Net proceeds from the sale of those notes along with cash on hand will be used to repay $375 million of APS’ outstanding 6.5% unsecured senior notes that mature on March 1.
With that, I will turn the call over to Don.

Today I will update you on three areas: first, APS’ pending retail rate settlement; two, our investments in renewable resources and other generation, and three, our operating performance in 2011.
We know Arizona regulation and APS’ recently filed rate settlement are top of mind for investors. So I will start with those topics.
On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS’s pending retail rate case. 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings signed the settlement agreement. Such broad-based support demonstrates significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the commission staff and other parties. Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.
The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Slide 14 highlights the benefits from an investor’s perspective. Notably, the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide a financial support structure for APS that will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next four years. 
Slide 15 shows the settlement’s proposed base rate changes which include: first, a non-fuel base rate increase of $116.3 million, reflecting, among other things, 15 months of post-test year plant additions in rate base. Second, a fuel related rate base decrease of $153.1 million attributable to lower commodity costs, and finally, a $36.8 million base rate increase to transfer revenues from the renewable energy surcharge to base rates. Those revenues relate primarily to the AZ Sun projects that will have been placed in service by March 31 of this year. 
Collectively, these terms would produce a net zero dollar change to existing base rates in 2012, which is an important benefit to APS customers. In addition, the average retail customer bill would decrease slightly when the rates proposed are first implemented. 
In addition to the base rate changes, the settlement contains a number of key financial provisions. I will provide a brief overview of these proposals which are shown on slide 16. Several newer modified rate adjustment mechanisms would further support timely cost recovery. These include: first, the adoption of a new lost fixed cost recovery rate mechanism or LFCR, to address ratemaking effects of energy efficiency and distributed renewable energy. Second, changes to APS’ power supply adjustor to allow 100% recovery of fuel and purchase power costs, thus eliminating the current 90:10 sharing.
Third, procedural changes related to the retail transmission cost adjustor to streamline the passthrough of future FERC rate changes. And fourth, modification of the environmental improvement surcharge to allow a timely recovery of certain carrying costs for government mandated environmental capital expenditures.
The settlement would permit APS to seek rate adjustments in 2013 for the Four Corners transaction after it’s consummated. I will provide an update on Four Corners plant momentarily. The settlement also would allow certain property tax expense variances caused by future changes to Arizona property tax rates to be deferred for future rate treatment. And finally, the settlement includes a four-year stay-out for the next general retail rate case filing. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after May 31 of 2015 for rates to become effective no earlier than July 1 of 2016.
We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay-out period. These include certain features of the settlement, such as the property tax deferrals and the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, rate adjustments related to the Four Corners acquisition and APS’ other tracking mechanisms and our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence. 
Key financial assumptions that underpin the settlement, including updated rate base, a 10% allowed return on equity, capital structure and fuel prices can be found on slide 17. 
Looking ahead, key procedural dates are shown on slide 18. Of recent note, the hearing in the matter was conducted January 26 through February 3. The next steps in the process are post-hearing briefs which are due February 29 and then again March 14. After that, the case will be in the hands of the commission’s chief administrative law judge for preparation of her recommended order on the matter. APS and the other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective July 1 of this year, which appears very reasonable under the current schedule.
We view the settlement agreement as a further sign of progress in Arizona’s regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the commission and various stakeholders to enhance the state’s regulatory framework and to find solutions that balance the interests of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities, we are on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Our plans place strong emphasis on solar power because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. Our most noteworthy progress related to renewable energy has been APS’ AZ Sun program.
The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program and its related constructive rate recovery. Under the program, which has been expanded since our last call, APS now plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility-scale photovoltaic solar plants in Arizona. The projects are to be placed in service in 2011 through 2015. The program was expanded last December when the Arizona commission approved the second 100 megawatts phase. 
In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed three new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation, adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to our generation mix. The facilities are located at the Paloma and Cotton Center plants, both of which are in Gila Bend, Arizona, a town southwest of Phoenix, and at the Hyder facility located in South-western Arizona. 
Construction and other development activities are currently underway for two sites for another 33 megawatts. These facilities would be in service in late 2012 and then again in 2013. To date, our announced projects and service and under development have a total capacity of 83 megawatts with an estimated capital investment of $375 million. A project summary is included on slide 19. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.
These renewable energy initiatives, particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. These projects also support Arizona’s economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design engineering and construction jobs for our state. 
Turning to the status of the Four Corners plant, as you know, late in 2010 we announced our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in North-western New Mexico. The plant addresses new environmental regulations while maintaining our well balanced resource portfolio. Our plant has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plant is included on slide 20.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies. In Arizona, the corporation commission completed a hearing on the matter last fall and we are awaiting a recommendation from the administrative law judge before the matter is brought before the commission for a vote.
Last week, the California public utilities commission issued a proposed decision, approving the sale by Southern California Edison, and a final decision from the CPUC is expected in March. We will remain optimistic that both APS and Southern California Edison will obtain the requisite favorable rulings from the respective commissions in a timely manner.
Our acquisition also was conditioned upon the execution of a new coal supply contract as well as approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions. 
Looking at our operating performance, our baseload, nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. For the full year 2011, Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a site average capacity factor of 91%. Palo Verde had its best production year ever, generating more than 31 million megawatt hours, topping at site record from 2010. Palo Verde is the only U.S. generating facility of any kind to ever exceed 30 million megawatt hours in a single year and it did so last year for the seventh time. Additionally, Palo Verde was the top U.S. power producer of any kind again in 2011. 
Our coal-fired plants continued their run of strong performance as well. For the year 2011, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 80%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 67%. 
Before I close, I will take just another minute or two to highlight a few additional achievements that reflect on our overall solid performance in 2011.
Pinnacle West stock outperformed both our industry and the broad market. We are pleased that our total shareholder return, which is comprised of stock price appreciation plus dividends, was 22% which compares favorably with the U.S. electric utility average of 21% and the S&P 500 index return of only 2%. 
Early last summer, Standard & Poor’s upgraded both APS’ and the parent company’s crediting ratings to BBB from BBB minus, thus improving our borrowing costs and more importantly, further securing our access to the capital markets. After more than two years of review and scrutiny, the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission approved 20-year license extensions for all of three Palo Verde units, assuring that Palo Verde will continue to power the South-western United States until the middle of this century. 
Our industrial safety record is at the top of our list of accomplishments. I am proud to report that in 2011, we had the lowest number of recordable injuries in our company’s history. However, I and every other member of our team will continue to drive safety performance towards our goal of zero injuries.
Regarding system reliability, APS’ average outage time per customer continued to be in the best quartile of our industry and set a new company record in 2011. Record setting reliability and other customer focused efforts allowed APS to continue achieving best of class customer satisfaction as evidenced by the company being ranked fourth highest nationally among large investor-owned electric utilities by JD Power and Associates.
In summary, our company aims to achieve top-tier performance and our employee team constantly strives to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we’re committed to achieving superior operational and financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business.
 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, so at this time, we’d be pleased to take any questions.

Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K filed this morning. Please note that slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Our 2011 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 2.
At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim."
296957,146208259,265617,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2012",2012-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide four. First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter.

First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will discuss our 2011 full year results provide. Third, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. And lastly, I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, for this year’s fourth quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $13 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with net income of $7 million, or $0.07 per share for the prior year’s fourth quarter.
Our ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share. For the 2011 fourth quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $12 million, or $0.11 per share, versus ongoing earnings of $5 million, or $0.05 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide six contains a reconciliation of our fourth quarter 2011 and 2010 GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings. The amounts for both quarters exclude the results related to our discontinued operations. The discontinued operations amounts relate primarily to APS Energy Services, part of which were sold in mid-2010 and the remainder of which was sold in mid-2011. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.
Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.05 per share, compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower operations and maintenance expenses improved earnings by $0.06 per share. The decrease largely reflects lower power plant maintenance costs as a result of more work being completed earlier in the year than in 2010, as well as lower employee benefit costs. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, or RES, energy efficiency, and similar regulatory programs, which are offset by comparable revenue amounts.
Third, the impact of all other items increased earnings by $0.01 per share. These favorable variances were partially offset by the absence of tax benefits of $0.06 per share that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Turning to slide eight and the composition of the net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated electricity gross margin was up $0.05 per share, compared with the 2010 quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The retail transmission cost adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1 of 2011 raised revenue by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenues pursuant to the 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share. The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.02 per share. Lastly, the non-cash mark-to-market valuation of APS’ fuel and purchase power hedges, net of the related power supply adjustor or PSA deferrals, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share compared with the year ago.
For your reference, our mark-to-market amounts by quarter for the past couple of years are shown in the appendix slide. 
Putting this all in context for earnings, let’s look at our full year comparison on slide nine. On a GAAP basis, for the year 2011 as a whole, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $339 million or $3.09 per share compared with net income of $350 million or $3.27 per share for 2010. Our ongoing earnings for 2011 were $2.99 per share compared with $3.03 per share in 2010. 
Our 2011 earnings exceeded our earnings guidance. We had projected ongoing earnings would be near the top of our guidance range of $2.75 to $2.90. The actual results were due in part to lower O&M costs than previously projected and colder than normal fourth quarter weather. Our cost management efforts companywide continued to control our O&M and other costs. Our guidance was based on normal weather, so the colder weather increased retail sales above our previous projections.
As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS’ pending rate case. However, to assess with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today’s slides.
We understand pensions are an important topic for the financial community at this time. To address that concern, I will give you a few of our pension statistics. Our pre-tax pension cost Charged to O&M was $29 million in 2011, net of the deferral under the 2009 retail rate settlement. We expect our annual pension expense to increase only about $5 million a year over the next couple of years. 
Also, in spite of market conditions, our pension plan earned 9.4% in 2011. Looking at our pension funding status, we estimate that our plan is 85% funded as calculated under the RES requirements. We did not need to make a contribution to the plan in 2011, and we currently anticipate contributing $65 million in 2012. All in all, we feel good about our pension expense and the funding outlook and status of the plan.
Turning to slide 10 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the fourth quarter although modestly. As shown on the slide 10, growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both solidly ahead of the prior year’s level. The rate of growth has moderated slightly from earlier in this in the year but the trend remains positive.
Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also showed steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven. All in all, these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contain with. Unemployment remains too high and the vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate are only marginally lower than our peaks in 2010.
One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand trend for industrial space in metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from our peak but other sectors are seeing only slow absorption of excess space. We believe the situation will continue restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years. 
APS’ customer base grew 0.4% in 2011 while retail sales increased 0.6% after reflecting the effects of the company’s synergy efficiency programs but excluding weather variations. Over the long term, though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve. 
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.6% for 2012 through 2014 as growth accelerates during that timeframe. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 to 2014, primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Lastly, I want to comment on our liquidity and financing. APS ended the fourth quarter with no short-term debt outstanding and has ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as to the debt capital markets.
Last month, APS issued $325 million of 30 years senior unsecured notes at 4.5%. To date, we believe this is the lowest interest rate on record ever for an S&P BBB rated corporate issuance in the utilities space. I believe the record interest rate and a strong demand for the notes speak highly to the progress we have made over the last three years. Net proceeds from the sale of those notes along with cash on hand will be used to repay $375 million of APS’ outstanding 6.5% unsecured senior notes that mature on March 1.
With that, I will turn the call over to Don."

Today I will update you on three areas: first, APS’ pending retail rate settlement; two, our investments in renewable resources and other generation, and three, our operating performance in 2011.
We know Arizona regulation and APS’ recently filed rate settlement are top of mind for investors. So I will start with those topics.
On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS’s pending retail rate case. 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings signed the settlement agreement. Such broad-based support demonstrates significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the commission staff and other parties. Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.
The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Slide 14 highlights the benefits from an investor’s perspective. Notably, the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide a financial support structure for APS that will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next four years. 
Slide 15 shows the settlement’s proposed base rate changes which include: first, a non-fuel base rate increase of $116.3 million, reflecting, among other things, 15 months of post-test year plant additions in rate base. Second, a fuel related rate base decrease of $153.1 million attributable to lower commodity costs, and finally, a $36.8 million base rate increase to transfer revenues from the renewable energy surcharge to base rates. Those revenues relate primarily to the AZ Sun projects that will have been placed in service by March 31 of this year. 
Collectively, these terms would produce a net zero dollar change to existing base rates in 2012, which is an important benefit to APS customers. In addition, the average retail customer bill would decrease slightly when the rates proposed are first implemented. 
In addition to the base rate changes, the settlement contains a number of key financial provisions. I will provide a brief overview of these proposals which are shown on slide 16. Several newer modified rate adjustment mechanisms would further support timely cost recovery. These include: first, the adoption of a new lost fixed cost recovery rate mechanism or LFCR, to address ratemaking effects of energy efficiency and distributed renewable energy. Second, changes to APS’ power supply adjustor to allow 100% recovery of fuel and purchase power costs, thus eliminating the current 90:10 sharing.
Third, procedural changes related to the retail transmission cost adjustor to streamline the passthrough of future FERC rate changes. And fourth, modification of the environmental improvement surcharge to allow a timely recovery of certain carrying costs for government mandated environmental capital expenditures.
The settlement would permit APS to seek rate adjustments in 2013 for the Four Corners transaction after it’s consummated. I will provide an update on Four Corners plan momentarily. The settlement also would allow certain property tax expense variances caused by future changes to Arizona property tax rates to be deferred for future rate treatment. And finally, the settlement includes a four-year stay-out for the next general retail rate case filing. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after May 31 of 2015 for rates to become effective no earlier than July 1 of 2016.
We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay-out period. These include certain features of the settlement, such as the property tax deferrals and the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, rate adjustments related to the Four Corners acquisition and APS’ other tracking mechanisms and our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence. 
Key financial assumptions that underpin the settlement, including updated rate base, a 10% allowed return on equity, capital structure and fuel prices can be found on slide 17. 
Looking ahead, key procedural dates are shown on slide 18. Of recent note, the hearing in the matter was conducted January 26 through February 3. The next steps in the process are post-hearing briefs which are due February 29 and then again March 14. After that, the case will be in the hands of the commission’s chief administrative law judge for preparation of her recommended order on the matter. APS and the other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective July 1 of this year, which appears very reasonable under the current schedule.
We view the settlement agreement as a further sign of progress in Arizona’s regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the commission and various stakeholders to enhance the state’s regulatory framework and to find solutions that balance the interests of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities, we are on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Our plans place strong emphasis on solar power because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. Our most noteworthy progress related to renewable energy has been APS’ AZ Sun program.
The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program and its related constructive rate recovery. Under the program, which has been expanded since our last call, APS now plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility-scale photovoltaic solar plants in Arizona. The projects are to be placed in service in 2011 through 2015. The program was expanded last December when the Arizona commission approved the second 100 megawatts phase. 
In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed three new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation, adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to our generation mix. The facilities are located at the Paloma and Cotton Center plants, both of which are in Gila Bend, Arizona, a town southwest of Phoenix, and at the Hyder facility located in South-western Arizona. 
Construction and other development activities are currently underway for two sites for another 33 megawatts. These facilities would be in service in late 2012 and then again in 2013. To date, our announced projects and service and under development have a total capacity of 83 megawatts with an estimated capital investment of $375 million. A project summary is included on slide 19. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.
These renewable energy initiatives, particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. These projects also support Arizona’s economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design engineering and construction jobs for our state. 
Turning to the status of the Four Corners plan, as you know, late in 2010 we announced our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in North-western New Mexico. The plant addresses new environmental regulations while maintaining our well balanced resource portfolio. Our plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included on slide 20.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies. In Arizona, the corporation commission completed a hearing on the matter last fall and we are awaiting a recommendation from the administrative law judge before the matter is brought before the commission for a vote.
Last week, the California public utilities commission issued a proposed decision, approving the sale by Southern California Edison, and a final decision from the CPUC is expected in March. We will remain optimistic that both APS and Southern California Edison will obtain the requisite favorable rulings from the respective commissions in a timely manner.
Our acquisition also was conditioned upon the execution of a new coal supply contract as well as approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions. 
Looking at our operating performance, our baseload, nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. For the full year 2011, Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a site average capacity factor of 91%. Palo Verde had its best production year ever, generating more than 31 million megawatt hours, topping at site record from 2010. Palo Verde is the only U.S. generating facility of any kind to ever exceed 30 million megawatt hours in a single year and it did so last year for the seventh time. Additionally, Palo Verde was the top U.S. power producer of any kind again in 2011. 
Our coal-fired plants continue their run of strong performance as well. For the year 2011, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 80%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 67%. 
Before I close, I will take just another minute or two to highlight a few additional achievements that reflect on our overall solid performance in 2011.
Pinnacle West stock outperformed both our industry and the broad market. We are pleased that our total shareholder return, which is comprised of stock price appreciation plus dividends, was 22% which compares favorably with the U.S. electric utility average of 21% and the S&P 500 index return of only 2%. 
Early last summer, Standard & Poor’s upgraded both APS’ and the parent company’s crediting ratings to BBB from BBB minus, thus improving our borrowing costs and more importantly, further securing our access to the capital markets. After more than two years of review and scrutiny, the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission approved 20-year license extensions for all of three Palo Verde units, assuring that Palo Verde will continue to power the South-western United States until the middle of this century. 
Our industrial safety record is at the top of our list of accomplishments. I am proud to report that in 2011, we had the lowest number of recordable injuries in our company’s history. However, I and every other member of our team will continue to drive safety performance towards our goal of zero injuries.
Regarding system reliability, APS’ average outage time per customer continued to be in the best quartile of our industry and set a new company record in 2011. Record setting reliability and other customer focused efforts allowed APS to continue achieving best of class customer satisfaction as evidenced by the company being ranked fourth highest nationally among large investor-owned electric utilities by JD Power and Associates.
In summary, our company aims to achieve top-tier performance and our employee team constantly strives to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we’re committed to achieving superior operational and financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, so at this time, we’d be pleased to take any questions."

At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim."
296957,146208259,281104,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2012",2012-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Becky.

First, I’ll review the consolidated fourth quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will discuss our 2011 full year results provide. Third, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. And lastly, I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide 5 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, for this year’s fourth quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $13 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with net income of $7 million, or $0.07 per share for the prior year’s fourth quarter.
Our ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share. For the 2011 fourth quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $12 million, or $0.11 per share, versus ongoing earnings of $5 million, or $0.05 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide 6 contains a reconciliation of our fourth quarter 2011 and 2010 GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings. The amounts for both quarters exclude the results related to our discontinued operations. The discontinued operations amounts relate primarily to APS Energy Services, part of which were sold in mid-2010 and the remainder of which was sold in mid-2011. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.
Moving to Slide 7, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.05 per share, compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower operations and maintenance expenses improved earnings by $0.06 per share. The decrease largely reflects lower power plant maintenance costs as a result of more work being completed earlier in the year than in 2010, as well as lower employee benefit costs. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, or RES, energy efficiency, and similar regulatory programs, which are offset by comparable revenue amounts.
Third, the impact of all other items increased earnings by $0.01 per share. These favorable variances were partially offset by the absence of tax benefits of $0.06 per share that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Turning to Slide 8 and the composition of the net increase in our regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated electricity gross margin was up $0.05 per share, compared with the 2010 quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The retail transmission cost adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1 of 2011 raised revenue by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenues pursuant to the 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share. The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.02 per share. Lastly, the non-cash mark-to-market valuation of APS’ fuel and purchase power hedges, net of the related power supply adjustor or PSA deferrals, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share compared with the year ago.
For your reference, our mark-to-market amounts by quarter for the past couple of years are shown in the appendix slide. 
Putting this all in context for earnings, let’s look at our full year comparison on Slide 9. On a GAAP basis, for the year 2011 as a whole, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $339 million or $3.09 per share compared with net income of $350 million or $3.27 per share for 2010. Our ongoing earnings for 2011 were $2.99 per share compared with $3.03 per share in 2010. 
Our 2011 earnings exceeded our earnings guidance. We had projected ongoing earnings would be near the top of our guidance range of $2.75 to $2.90. The actual results were due in part to lower O&M costs than previously projected and colder than normal fourth quarter weather. Our cost management efforts companywide continued to control our O&M and other costs. Our guidance was based on normal weather, so the colder weather increased retail sales above our previous projections.
As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS’ pending rate case. However, to assess with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today’s slides.
We understand pensions are an important topic for the financial community at this time. To address that concern, I will give you a few of our pension statistics. Our pretax pension cost Charged to O&M was $29 million in 2011, net of the deferral under the 2009 retail rate settlement. We expect our annual pension expense to increase only about $5 million a year over the next couple of years. 
Also, in spite of market conditions, our pension plan earned 9.4% in 2011. Looking at our pension funding status, we estimate that our plan is 85% funded as calculated under the RES requirements. We did not need to make a contribution to the plan in 2011, and we currently anticipate contributing $65 million in 2012. All in all, we feel good about our pension expense and the funding outlook and status of the plan.
Turning to Slide 10 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the fourth quarter although modestly. As shown on the Slide 10, growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both solidly ahead of the prior year’s level. The rate of growth has moderated slightly from earlier in this in the year but the trend remains positive.
Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also showed steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven. All in all, these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contain with. Unemployment remains too high and the vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate are only marginally lower than our peaks in 2010.
One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand trend for industrial space in metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from our peak but other sectors are seeing only slow absorption of excess space. We believe the situation will continue restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least 2 to 3 years. 
APS’ customer base grew 0.4% in 2011 while retail sales increased 0.6% after reflecting the effects of the company’s synergy efficiency programs but excluding weather variations. Over the long term, though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve. 
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.6% for 2012 through 2014 as growth accelerates during that timeframe. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 to 2014, primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Lastly, I want to comment on our liquidity and financing. APS ended the fourth quarter with no short-term debt outstanding and has ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as to the debt capital markets.
Last month, APS issued $325 million of 30 years senior unsecured notes at 4.5%. To date, we believe this is the lowest interest rate on record ever for an S&P BBB rated corporate issuance in the utilities space. I believe the record interest rate and a strong demand for the notes speak highly to the progress we have made over the last 3 years. Net proceeds from the sale of those notes along with cash on hand will be used to repay $375 million of APS’ outstanding 6.5% unsecured senior notes that mature on March 1.
With that, I will turn the call over to Don."

Today I will update you on 3 areas: first, APS’ pending retail rate settlement; two, our investments in renewable resources and other generation, and three, our operating performance in 2011.",1786,"Thanks, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today I will update you on 3 areas: first, APS’ pending retail rate settlement; two, our investments in renewable resources and other generation, and three, our operating performance in 2011.
We know Arizona regulation and APS’ recently filed rate settlement are top of mind for investors. So I will start with those topics.
On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS’s pending retail rate case. 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings signed the settlement agreement. Such broad-based support demonstrates significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the commission staff and other parties. Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.
The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Slide 14 highlights the benefits from an investor’s perspective. Notably, the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide a financial support structure for APS that will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next 4 years. 
Slide 15 shows the settlement’s proposed base rate changes which include: first, a non-fuel base rate increase of $116.3 million, reflecting, among other things, 15 months of post-test year plant additions in rate base. Second, a fuel related rate base decrease of $153.1 million attributable to lower commodity costs, and finally, a $36.8 million base rate increase to transfer revenues from the renewable energy surcharge to base rates. Those revenues relate primarily to the AZ Sun projects that will have been placed in service by March 31 of this year. 
Collectively, these terms would produce a net zero dollar change to existing base rates in 2012, which is an important benefit to APS customers. In addition, the average retail customer bill would decrease slightly when the rates proposed are first implemented. 
In addition to the base rate changes, the settlement contains a number of key financial provisions. I will provide a brief overview of these proposals which are shown on Slide 16. Several newer modified rate adjustment mechanisms would further support timely cost recovery. These include: first, the adoption of a new lost fixed cost recovery rate mechanism or LFCR, to address ratemaking effects of energy efficiency and distributed renewable energy. Second, changes to APS’ power supply adjustor to allow 100% recovery of fuel and purchase power costs, thus eliminating the current 90:10 sharing.
Third, procedural changes related to the retail transmission cost adjustor to streamline the pass-through of future FERC rate changes. And fourth, modification of the environmental improvement surcharge to allow a timely recovery of certain carrying costs for government mandated environmental capital expenditures.
The settlement would permit APS to seek rate adjustments in 2013 for the Four Corners transaction after it’s consummated. I will provide an update on Four Corners plan momentarily. The settlement also would allow certain property tax expense variances caused by future changes to Arizona property tax rates to be deferred for future rate treatment. And finally, the settlement includes a 4-year stay-out for the next general retail rate case filing. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after May 31 of 2015 for rates to become effective no earlier than July 1 of 2016.
We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay-out period. These include certain features of the settlement, such as the property tax deferrals and the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, rate adjustments related to the Four Corners acquisition and APS’ other tracking mechanisms and our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence. 
Key financial assumptions that underpin the settlement, including updated rate base, a 10% allowed return on equity, capital structure and fuel prices can be found on Slide 17. 
Looking ahead, key procedural dates are shown on Slide 18. Of recent note, the hearing in the matter was conducted January 26 through February 3. The next steps in the process are post-hearing briefs which are due February 29 and then again March 14. After that, the case will be in the hands of the commission’s chief administrative law judge for preparation of her recommended order on the matter. APS and the other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective July 1 of this year, which appears very reasonable under the current schedule.
We view the settlement agreement as a further sign of progress in Arizona’s regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the commission and various stakeholders to enhance the state’s regulatory framework and to find solutions that balance the interests of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Now turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities, we are on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Our plans place strong emphasis on solar power because Arizona has some of the best solar conditions in the world. Our most noteworthy progress related to renewable energy has been APS’ AZ Sun program.
The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program and its related constructive rate recovery. Under the program, which has been expanded since our last call, APS now plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility-scale photovoltaic solar plants in Arizona. The projects are to be placed in service in 2011 through 2015. The program was expanded last December when the Arizona commission approved the second 100 megawatts phase. 
In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed 3 new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation, adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to our generation mix. The facilities are located at the Paloma and Cotton Center plants, both of which are in Gila Bend, Arizona, a town southwest of Phoenix, and at the Hyder facility located in South-western Arizona. 
Construction and other development activities are currently underway for 2 sites for another 33 megawatts. These facilities would be in service in late 2012 and then again in 2013. To date, our announced projects and service and under development have a total capacity of 83 megawatts with an estimated capital investment of $375 million. A project summary is included on Slide 19. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.
These renewable energy initiatives, particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. These projects also support Arizona’s economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design engineering and construction jobs for our state. 
Turning to the status of the Four Corners plan, as you know, late in 2010 we announced our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in North-western New Mexico. The plant addresses new environmental regulations while maintaining our well balanced resource portfolio. Our plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included on Slide 20.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies. In Arizona, the corporation commission completed a hearing on the matter last fall and we are awaiting a recommendation from the administrative law judge before the matter is brought before the commission for a vote.
Last week, the California public utilities commission issued a proposed decision, approving the sale by Southern California Edison, and a final decision from the CPUC is expected in March. We will remain optimistic that both APS and Southern California Edison will obtain the requisite favorable rulings from the respective commissions in a timely manner.
Our acquisition also was conditioned upon the execution of a new coal supply contract as well as approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions. 
Looking at our operating performance, our baseload, nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. For the full year 2011, Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a site average capacity factor of 91%. Palo Verde had its best production year ever, generating more than 31 million megawatt hours, topping at site record from 2010. Palo Verde is the only U.S. generating facility of any kind to ever exceed 30 million megawatt hours in a single year and it did so last year for the seventh time. Additionally, Palo Verde was the top U.S. power producer of any kind again in 2011. 
Our coal-fired plants continue their run of strong performance as well. For the year 2011, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 80%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 67%. 
Before I close, I will take just another minute or 2 to highlight a few additional achievements that reflect on our overall solid performance in 2011.
Pinnacle West stock outperformed both our industry and the broad market. We are pleased that our total shareholder return, which is comprised of stock price appreciation plus dividends, was 22% which compares favorably with the U.S. electric utility average of 21% and the S&P 500 index return of only 2%. 
Early last summer, Standard & Poor’s upgraded both APS’ and the parent company’s crediting ratings to BBB from BBB minus, thus improving our borrowing costs and more importantly, further securing our access to the capital markets. After more than 2 years of review and scrutiny, the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission approved 20-year license extensions for all of 3 Palo Verde units, assuring that Palo Verde will continue to power the South-western United States until the middle of this century. 
Our industrial safety record is at the top of our list of accomplishments. I am proud to report that in 2011, we had the lowest number of recordable injuries in our company’s history. However, I and every other member of our team will continue to drive safety performance towards our goal of zero injuries.
Regarding system reliability, APS’ average outage time per customer continued to be in the best quartile of our industry and set a new company record in 2011. Record setting reliability and other customer focused efforts allowed APS to continue achieving best of class customer satisfaction as evidenced by the company being ranked fourth highest nationally among large investor-owned electric utilities by JD Power and Associates.
In summary, our company aims to achieve top-tier performance and our employee team constantly strives to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we’re committed to achieving superior operational and financial results by concentrating on our core electric utility business.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, so at this time, we’d be pleased to take any questions."

Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Our first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 10.
At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.

First I will review the consolidated first-quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second I'll provide a brief update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy and last I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On GAAP basis for this year's first quarter we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $8 million or $0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $15 million or $0.14 per share for the prior year's first quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.08 per share. For the 2012 first quarter we had consolidated ongoing loss of $7 million or $0.07 per share versus an ongoing loss of $16 million or $0.15 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide six contains a reconciliation of our first quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate and energy services businesses. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on our ongoing results.
Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margins added one penny per share compared against the prior year's first-quarter earnings. Several plusses and minuses comprises positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second lower operations and maintenance expense improved earnings by $0.07 per share. The expense decrease largely reflects lower fossil plant maintenance cost as a result of less work being completed early in the year compared to 2011 as well as the net decrease in other items.
This on end variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard or RAS, energy efficiency, similar regulatory programs as well as the 2011 first quarter settlement of transmission rights, away costs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts. Third, lower infrastructure related costs increased earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the NRC for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
Those cost reductions were partially offset by higher property tax related to tax rates. Fourth, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Finally our first-quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.02 per share because of the Arizona (inaudible) plants that were placed in service last year and earlier this year.
This net variance is reflected in various items on the income statement. Total gross margin was up one penny per share compared to the 2011 first quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The Retail Transmission Cost Adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenue pursuant to 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share.
The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.03 per share. Lower usage by APS retail customers compared against last year's first quarter decreased our quarterly results by $0.04 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 0.9% in the quarterly comparison after accounting for the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
Customer growth of 0.8% over a year ago levels helped offset the decline in kilowatt hour sales. The effects of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's first quarter was warmer than normal with residential heating degree days lower than normal by 17%.
Turning to slide nine and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the first quarter although modestly. As shown on slide nine growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both slightly ahead of the prior year's levels.
In particular the rate of overall job growth has set up well for almost a year and virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also shows steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven.
Additionally APS' customer base grew 0.8% in the first quarter which is the strongest growth we have seen in three years. All-in-all these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contend with. 
Unemployment remains too high and vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate only marginally lower in their peaks of 2010. One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand for industrial space in the Metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from their peak but other sectors are seeing only slow absorption of excess space. We believe that this situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years.
Over the long term though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth in [inaudible] to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.6% for 2012 to 2014. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2014 primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Finally I want to comment on our liquidity and financing plans. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding. APS had $217 million of short-term borrowings and both have ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as lower cost funding through the debt capital markets.
As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS’ pending retail rate case. However to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slide.
Additionally if the constructed element in the pending retail rate case is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. We would be comfortable with our ability to fund APS’ capital expenditure program with no new equity needed until 2013 at the earliest.
And with that I will turn the call over to Don. Don?

And thank you all for joining us today. I will update you on developments in the following areas. Arizona regulation and APS’ pending retail rates supplement, our investments in generations including renewable resources and our overall operating performance. I will start with APS’ pending rate settlement. On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS’ pending retail rate case which was signed by 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings. Very late yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission’s Chief Administrative Law Judge issued her recommendation that the settlement be improved without material modifications.
Collectively, the settlement terms would produce a net $0 change to existing change to existing base rates 2012, an important benefit for APS customers. In addition to the base rate change is a settlement contained a number of key financial provisions which we discussed during last quarter’s conference call.
Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined on slides 13 to 17 in the appendix to your slide space. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Notably the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide financial support for APS will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next four years. The settlement also includes a four year stay out for the next general retail rate case. Under this provision, APS’ may file its next general rate case on or after May 31, 2015 for based rate to become effective not earlier than July 1, 2016.
We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay out period. These factors include first APS’ rate adjustment mechanisms such as the power supply adjustor and the transmission cost adjustor. Second, provision to allow APS to seek rate adjustments related the Four Corners acquisition if it is can’t submitted and I’ll review the Four Corners progress momentarily.
Third, certain features of settlements such as the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and the property tax deferrals. And finally our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence.
Looking at key procedural dates, the parties to the case have until May 11 to file any exceptions to the ALJ’s recommended order. Thereafter, the Commissioner will consider a settlement at an open meeting which has not been yet schedule.
APS and other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective to July 1 of this year and that’s supported by the judges recommended.
We view the settlement agreement as a further sign or progress in Arizona regulatory environment. With its broad based support, the settlement demonstrates significant collaborations and cooperation among APS, the ACC staff and the variety of other parties.
We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with Arizona Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to enhance the state’s regulatory framework and to find solutions of balance of the interested customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
Turning to the Four Corners plan, we continue making progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners plant in Northwestern New Mexico. The multi-part plant addresses environmental regulations while maintaining a well balanced resource portfolio. It has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included on slide 18.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and federal regulators and other government agencies. Noteworthy progress has been made in this regard. On April 18, the Arizona Corporation Commission authorized APS to proceed with the acquisition and to defer certain transaction related cost until the acquired generation is played in to retail rates with a condition that the transaction may not close prior to December 1st of this year.
The commission established a closing date parameter to reduce the cost impacts of the transaction on customers. Separately, as I have already mentioned, APS suspending retail rate settlement contains a proposal that would permit APS to seek to reflect the Four Corners transaction in retail rates on or after July 1 of 2013, if it is [inaudible] submitted.
In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the transaction for Southern California Edison on March 29. Other conditions that must be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of the new coal supply contract, approval by the Federal Energy regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions.
We remain optimistic about our pending remaining approvals and completing the related required activities to allow the completion of our Four Corners plant in a timely manner.
Turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities; we were on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Under the AZ Sun program, APS plans develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale portable take solar plants in Arizona.
The projects that we placed in service in 2011 through 2015 and the Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program with a constructive rate recovery mechanism. To-date, we have announced AZ Sun projects that have a total production capacity of 104 megawatts at an estimated capital investment of $451 million. A summary of the program is included on slide 19.
In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed three new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to APS’ generation mix.
Construction and other development activities are currently underway at two sites for another 54 megawatts and we anticipate these facilities will be placed in service in late 2012 and in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.
Our renewable energy initiatives particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. These projects also support our economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design, engineering and construction jobs for our state. We are pleased that APS’ accomplishments installing and promoting solar power have been recognized by a number of independent third parties.
For example in April, APS was named one of the top 10 Solar Electric Utilities in the United States by the Solar Electric Power Association.
Looking at our operating performance, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. During the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 94% capacity factor. This capacity factor reflects the fact that Unit 3’s refueling outage began during the quarter on March 17th and that 32 day outage was successfully completed on April 17th making it the second charters to refueling outage in the Palo Verde site’s history.
The chartered duration demonstrates Palo Verde’s commitment to reducing its average refueling outage time, while maintaining its commitment to safely and efficiently generate electricity for the long term. The site’s next refueling outage will be Unit 2 this fall.
Our coal-fired plants also continued their run of solid performance.
Turning to the quality of our customer service, in February of this year JD Power & Associates released the results of its most recent Business Customer Survey. I am pleased that APS continues its record of performance excellence in overall customer satisfaction.
In the most recent results APS ranked fourth nationally among 47 large investor owned electric utilities. More specific to our region, we were rated second among 10 investor owned utilities in the West. In addition, for the third consecutive year APS was awarded the environmental protection agencies highest honor for continuing leadership and protecting the environment through energy efficiency programs.
The EPA’s ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award recognized two APS program for promoting energy efficiency and reducing Greenhouse gas emissions.
In summary, company aims to achieve top tier performance and our employee team constantly try to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, I assure you we remain focused on our core utility business, operational excellence and achieving a constructive regulatory outcome. All for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and we would be pleased to take questions at this time.

Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Vice President of Rates and Regulation is also here with us.
Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Our first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 10.
At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim."
296957,204539197,297060,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Becky.

First I will review the consolidated first-quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second I'll provide a brief update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy, and last I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide 5 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On GAAP basis for this year's first quarter, we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $8 million or $0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $15 million or $0.14 per share for the prior year's first quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.08 per share. For the 2012 first quarter we had consolidated ongoing loss of $7 million or $0.07 per share versus an ongoing loss of $16 million or $0.15 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide 6 contains a reconciliation of our first quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate and energy services businesses. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on our ongoing results.
Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margins added $0.01 per share compared against the prior year's first-quarter earnings. Several plusses and minuses comprises positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second lower operations and maintenance expense improved earnings by $0.07 per share. The expense decrease largely reflects lower fossil plant maintenance cost as a result of less work being completed early in the year compared to 2011 as well as the net decrease in other items.
This on end variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard or RAS, energy efficiency, similar regulatory programs as well as the 2011 first quarter settlement of transmission rights, away costs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts. Third, lower infrastructure related costs increased earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the NRC for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
Those cost reductions were partially offset by higher property tax related to tax rates. Fourth, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Finally our first-quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.02 per share because of the Arizona Sun plants that were placed in service last year and earlier this year.
This net variance is reflected in various items on the income statement. Total gross margin was up $ 0.01 per share compared to the 2011 first quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The Retail Transmission Cost Adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenue pursuant to 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share.
The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.03 per share. Lower usage by APS retail customers compared against last year's first quarter decreased our quarterly results by $0.04 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 0.9% in the quarterly comparison after accounting for the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
Customer growth of 0.8% over a year ago levels helped offset the decline in kilowatt hour sales. The effects of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's first quarter was warmer than normal with residential heating degree days lower than normal by 17%.
Turning to slide 9 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the first quarter although modestly. As shown on slide 9, growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both slightly ahead of the prior year's levels.
In particular the rate of overall job growth has set up well for almost a year, and virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also shows steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven.
Additionally APS' customer base grew 0.8% in the first quarter which is the strongest growth we have seen in 3 years. All-in-all these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contend with.
Unemployment remains too high and vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate only marginally lower in their peaks of 2010. One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand for industrial space in the Metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from their peak but other sectors are seeing only slow absorption of excess space. We believe that this situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years.
Over the long term though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth in usage [ph] to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.6% for 2012 to 2014. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2014 primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Finally I want to comment on our liquidity and financing plans. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding. APS had $217 million of short-term borrowings and both have ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as lower cost funding through the debt capital markets.
As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS’ pending retail rate case. However to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slide.
Additionally if the constructed settlement in the pending retail rate case is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. We would be comfortable with our ability to fund APS’ capital expenditure program with no new equity needed until 2013 at the earliest.
And with that I will turn the call over to Don. Don?"

And thank you all for joining us today. I will update you on developments in the following areas. Arizona regulation and APS’ pending retail rates supplement, our investments in generations including renewable resources and our overall operating performance. I will start with APS’ pending rate settlement. On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS’ pending retail rate case, which was signed by 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings. Very late yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission’s Chief Administrative Law Judge issued her recommendation that the settlement be improved without material modifications.
Collectively, the settlement terms would produce a net $0 change to existing base rates 2012, an important benefit for APS customers. In addition to the base rate change is a settlement contained a number of key financial provisions which we discussed during last quarter’s conference call.
Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined on slides 13 to 17 in the appendix to your slide space. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Notably the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide financial support for APS will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next 4 years. The settlement also includes a four year stay out for the next general retail rate case. Under this provision, APS’ may file its next general rate case on or after May 31, 2015 for based rate to become effective not earlier than July 1, 2016.
We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay out period. These factors include first APS’ rate adjustment mechanisms such as the power supply adjustor and the transmission cost adjustor. Second, provision to allow APS to seek rate adjustments related the Four Corners acquisition if it is can’t submitted and I’ll review the Four Corners progress momentarily.
Third, certain features of settlements such as the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and the property tax deferrals. And finally our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence.
Looking at key procedural dates, the parties to the case have until May 11 to file any exceptions to the ALJ’s recommended order. Thereafter, the Commissioner will consider the settlement at an open meeting which has not been yet scheduled.
APS and other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective to July 1 of this year and that’s supported by the judges recommended.
We view the settlement agreement as a further sign or progress in Arizona regulatory environment. With its broad based support, the settlement demonstrates significant collaborations and cooperation among APS, the ACC staff and the variety of other parties.
We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with Arizona Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to enhance the state’s regulatory framework and to find solutions of balance of the interested customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
Turning to the Four Corners plan, we continue making progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners plant in Northwestern New Mexico. The multi-part plant addresses environmental regulations while maintaining a well balanced resource portfolio. It has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included on slide 18.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and federal regulators and other government agencies. Noteworthy progress has been made in this regard. On April 18, the Arizona Corporation Commission authorized APS to proceed with the acquisition and to defer certain transaction related cost until the acquired generation is played in to retail rates with a condition that the transaction may not close prior to December 1st of this year.
The commission established a closing date parameter to reduce the cost impacts of the transaction on customers. Separately, as I have already mentioned, APS suspending retail rate settlement contains a proposal that would permit APS to seek to reflect the Four Corners transaction in retail rates on or after July 1 of 2013, if it is consummated.
In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the transaction for Southern California Edison on March 29. Other conditions that must be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of the new coal supply contract, approval by the Federal Energy regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions.
We remain optimistic about our pending remaining approvals and completing the related required activities to allow the completion of our Four Corners plant in a timely manner.
Turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities; we were on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Under the AZ Sun program, APS plans develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale portable take solar plants in Arizona.
The projects that we placed in service in 2011 through 2015 and the Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program with a constructive rate recovery mechanism. To-date, we have announced AZ Sun projects that have a total production capacity of 104 megawatts at an estimated capital investment of $451 million. A summary of the program is included on slide 19.
In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed 3 new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to APS’ generation mix.
Construction and other development activities are currently underway at 2 sites for another 54 megawatts, and we anticipate these facilities will be placed in service in late 2012 and in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.
Our renewable energy initiatives particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. These projects also support our economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design, engineering and construction jobs for our state. We are pleased that APS’ accomplishments installing and promoting solar power have been recognized by a number of independent third parties.
For example in April, APS was named one of the top 10 Solar Electric Utilities in the United States by the Solar Electric Power Association.
Looking at our operating performance, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. During the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 94% capacity factor. This capacity factor reflects the fact that Unit 3’s refueling outage began during the quarter on March 17th and that 32 day outage was successfully completed on April 17th making it the second charters to refueling outage in the Palo Verde site’s history.
The chartered duration demonstrates Palo Verde’s commitment to reducing its average refueling outage time, while maintaining its commitment to safely and efficiently generate electricity for the long term. The site’s next refueling outage will be Unit 2 this fall.
Our coal-fired plants also continued their run of solid performance.
Turning to the quality of our customer service, in February of this year JD Power & Associates released the results of its most recent Business Customer Survey. I am pleased that APS continues its record of performance excellence in overall customer satisfaction.
In the most recent results APS ranked fourth nationally among 47 large investor owned electric utilities. More specific to our region, we were rated second among 10 investor owned utilities in the West. In addition, for the third consecutive year APS was awarded the environmental protection agencies highest honor for continuing leadership and protecting the environment through energy efficiency programs.
The EPA’s ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award recognized 2 APS program for promoting energy efficiency and reducing Greenhouse gas emissions.
In summary, company aims to achieve top tier performance and our employee team constantly try to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, I assure you we remain focused on our core utility business, operational excellence and achieving a constructive regulatory outcome. All for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.

Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Vice President of Rates and Regulation is also here with us.
Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.
Our first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 10.
At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim."
296957,204539197,297739,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide 4. First I will review the consolidated first-quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter.

First I will review the consolidated first-quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second I'll provide a brief update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy, and last I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.
Slide 5 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On GAAP basis for this year's first quarter, we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $8 million or $0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $15 million or $0.14 per share for the prior year's first quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.08 per share. For the 2012 first quarter we had consolidated ongoing loss of $7 million or $0.07 per share versus an ongoing loss of $16 million or $0.15 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide 6 contains a reconciliation of our first quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate and energy services businesses. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on our ongoing results.
Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margins added $0.01 per share compared against the prior year's first-quarter earnings. Several plusses and minuses comprises positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second lower operations and maintenance expense improved earnings by $0.07 per share. The expense decrease largely reflects lower fossil plant maintenance cost as a result of less work being completed early in the year compared to 2011 as well as the net decrease in other items.
This on end variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard or RAS, energy efficiency, similar regulatory programs as well as the 2011 first quarter settlement of transmission rights, away costs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts. Third, lower infrastructure related costs increased earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the NRC for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
Those cost reductions were partially offset by higher property tax related to tax rates. Fourth, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Finally our first-quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.02 per share because of the Arizona Sun plants that were placed in service last year and earlier this year.
This net variance is reflected in various items on the income statement. Total gross margin was up $ 0.01 per share compared to the 2011 first quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The Retail Transmission Cost Adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenue pursuant to 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share.
The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.03 per share. Lower usage by APS retail customers compared against last year's first quarter decreased our quarterly results by $0.04 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 0.9% in the quarterly comparison after accounting for the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
Customer growth of 0.8% over a year ago levels helped offset the decline in kilowatt hour sales. The effects of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's first quarter was warmer than normal with residential heating degree days lower than normal by 17%.
Turning to slide 9 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the first quarter although modestly. As shown on slide 9, growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both slightly ahead of the prior year's levels.
In particular the rate of overall job growth has set up well for almost a year, and virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also shows steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven.
Additionally APS' customer base grew 0.8% in the first quarter which is the strongest growth we have seen in 3 years. All-in-all these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contend with.
Unemployment remains too high and vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate only marginally lower in their peaks of 2010. One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand for industrial space in the Metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from their peak but other sectors are seeing only slow absorption of excess space. We believe that this situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years.
Over the long term though, we remain confident in Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth in usage [ph] to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.6% for 2012 to 2014. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2014 primarily due to APS’ energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.
Finally I want to comment on our liquidity and financing plans. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding. APS had $217 million of short-term borrowings and both have ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as lower cost funding through the debt capital markets.
As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS’ pending retail rate case. However to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slide.
Additionally if the constructed settlement in the pending retail rate case is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. We would be comfortable with our ability to fund APS’ capital expenditure program with no new equity needed until 2013 at the earliest.
And with that I will turn the call over to Don. Don?"

And thank you all for joining us today. I will update you on developments in the following areas. Arizona regulation and APS’ pending retail rates supplement, our investments in generations including renewable resources and our overall operating performance. I will start with APS’ pending rate settlement. On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS’ pending retail rate case, which was signed by 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings. Very late yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission’s Chief Administrative Law Judge issued her recommendation that the settlement be improved without material modifications.
Collectively, the settlement terms would produce a net $0 change to existing base rates 2012, an important benefit for APS customers. In addition to the base rate change is a settlement contained a number of key financial provisions which we discussed during last quarter’s conference call.
Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined on slides 13 to 17 in the appendix to your slide space. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Notably the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide financial support for APS will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next 4 years. The settlement also includes a four year stay out for the next general retail rate case. Under this provision, APS’ may file its next general rate case on or after May 31, 2015 for based rate to become effective not earlier than July 1, 2016.
We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay out period. These factors include first APS’ rate adjustment mechanisms such as the power supply adjustor and the transmission cost adjustor. Second, provision to allow APS to seek rate adjustments related the Four Corners acquisition if it is can’t submitted and I’ll review the Four Corners progress momentarily.
Third, certain features of settlements such as the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and the property tax deferrals. And finally our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence.
Looking at key procedural dates, the parties to the case have until May 11 to file any exceptions to the ALJ’s recommended order. Thereafter, the Commissioner will consider the settlement at an open meeting which has not been yet scheduled.
APS and other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective to July 1 of this year and that’s supported by the judges recommended.
We view the settlement agreement as a further sign or progress in Arizona regulatory environment. With its broad based support, the settlement demonstrates significant collaborations and cooperation among APS, the ACC staff and the variety of other parties.
We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with Arizona Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to enhance the state’s regulatory framework and to find solutions of balance of the interested customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
Turning to the Four Corners plan, we continue making progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners plant in Northwestern New Mexico. The multi-part plant addresses environmental regulations while maintaining a well balanced resource portfolio. It has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included on slide 18.
The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and federal regulators and other government agencies. Noteworthy progress has been made in this regard. On April 18, the Arizona Corporation Commission authorized APS to proceed with the acquisition and to defer certain transaction related cost until the acquired generation is played in to retail rates with a condition that the transaction may not close prior to December 1st of this year.
The commission established a closing date parameter to reduce the cost impacts of the transaction on customers. Separately, as I have already mentioned, APS suspending retail rate settlement contains a proposal that would permit APS to seek to reflect the Four Corners transaction in retail rates on or after July 1 of 2013, if it is consummated.
In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the transaction for Southern California Edison on March 29. Other conditions that must be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of the new coal supply contract, approval by the Federal Energy regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions.
We remain optimistic about our pending remaining approvals and completing the related required activities to allow the completion of our Four Corners plant in a timely manner.
Turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities; we were on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Under the AZ Sun program, APS plans develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale portable take solar plants in Arizona.
The projects that we placed in service in 2011 through 2015 and the Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program with a constructive rate recovery mechanism. To-date, we have announced AZ Sun projects that have a total production capacity of 104 megawatts at an estimated capital investment of $451 million. A summary of the program is included on slide 19.
In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed 3 new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to APS’ generation mix.
Construction and other development activities are currently underway at 2 sites for another 54 megawatts, and we anticipate these facilities will be placed in service in late 2012 and in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.
Our renewable energy initiatives particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. These projects also support our economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design, engineering and construction jobs for our state. We are pleased that APS’ accomplishments installing and promoting solar power have been recognized by a number of independent third parties.
For example in April, APS was named one of the top 10 Solar Electric Utilities in the United States by the Solar Electric Power Association.
Looking at our operating performance, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. During the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 94% capacity factor. This capacity factor reflects the fact that Unit 3’s refueling outage began during the quarter on March 17th and that 32 day outage was successfully completed on April 17th making it the second charters to refueling outage in the Palo Verde site’s history.
The chartered duration demonstrates Palo Verde’s commitment to reducing its average refueling outage time, while maintaining its commitment to safely and efficiently generate electricity for the long term. The site’s next refueling outage will be Unit 2 this fall.
Our coal-fired plants also continued their run of solid performance.
Turning to the quality of our customer service, in February of this year JD Power & Associates released the results of its most recent Business Customer Survey. I am pleased that APS continues its record of performance excellence in overall customer satisfaction.
In the most recent results APS ranked fourth nationally among 47 large investor owned electric utilities. More specific to our region, we were rated second among 10 investor owned utilities in the West. In addition, for the third consecutive year APS was awarded the environmental protection agencies highest honor for continuing leadership and protecting the environment through energy efficiency programs.
The EPA’s ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award recognized 2 APS program for promoting energy efficiency and reducing Greenhouse gas emissions.
In summary, company aims to achieve top tier performance and our employee team constantly try to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, I assure you we remain focused on our core utility business, operational excellence and achieving a constructive regulatory outcome. All for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and we would be pleased to take questions at this time."

The decision came 11 ½ months after the case was filed, the quickest resolution of a major Arizona utility rate case in recent memory.  Supported by 22 of the 24 active parties to the case, the settlement shows significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the Arizona Corporation Commission and other parties as well as a comprehensive commitment to an expedited process.  
The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.  Details of the agreement, as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.  
The settlement prevents base rates from increasing for four years, but it is not a rate freeze.  Under the agreement, APS may file it’s next general rate case on or after May 31st of 2015 for new base rates to become effective on or after July 1st of 2016.  That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during the stay-out period.  
Aspects related to that settlement include first APS’s rate adjustment mechanisms.  All of APS’s rate adjustment mechanisms will continue to function throughout the stay-out period.  These mechanism include, among others, first the preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjusted, which beginning in 2013 can pass annual changes in the preferred formula rate to APS retail customers without explicit ACC approval because of the settlement.  
Next, the renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions and then the loss fixed cost recovery mechanisms, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed costs related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation. 
And finally, an enhanced environmental improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying costs on government-mandated environmental capital projects.  Second, a carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition.  This provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013 if the acquisition is consummated as we currently plan.  I will review our progress in the Four Corners plan momentarily.  
Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases.  These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases and 100% pass through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster.  
And finally, without a time-sensitive base rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and discipline cost management.  
This settlement builds upon a constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provides financial support for APS that will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next four years.  
In a related manner, on July 18th, the Arizona Commission approved the 2012 retail transmission cost adjuster increase.  The rate change, which became effective August 1st will increase annual revenues $18 million.  As I mentioned earlier, beginning next year, any future changes can automatically go into effect June 1st of each year without separate Arizona Commission action.  
We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with the Arizona Corporate Commission and various stakeholders to further influence the state’s regulatory framework and define solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.  
Our selective capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS’s electricity customers while meeting goals for Arizona’s sustainable energy future and environmental compliance.  
I’ll update you on two major components of our capital expenditures program; the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition.  Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program are important measured steps towards advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future.  Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.  
A summary of the program is included in the appendix to today’s slides.  This program is progressing on target.  To date, we have placed in commercial operation three plants with a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity.  Construction and other development activities are currently underway at two sites for another 54 megawatts.  We plan to place 19 megawatts into service late this year and the remainder into operation in 2013.  
Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.  
We are continuing to make progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico.  A summary of that plan is included in the appendix to today’s slides.  The plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially.  The acquisition requires approvals from Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies, most of which have been obtained.  Noteworthy conditions that remain to be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of a new coal supply contract reasonably acceptable to APS and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  We continue to target closing of the acquisition late this year.  
In addition to strategic capital investments, excellence in day-to-day execution remains a top priority.  In the second quarter, our operating results reflected that priority.  Palo Verde operated at a 93% capacity factor, reflecting a portion of the planned refueling outage at Unit 3, which was completed on April 17th in 32 days.  The facility’s second shortest refueling outage to date.  
On the customer service side of our business, JD Power and Associates released the results of this year’s residential customer survey last month.  I am pleased that APS was ranked third best among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities, continuing the recognition of our excellence and overall customer satisfaction.  
More specific to our region, we were ranked second among the ten investor-owned utilities in the West.  
Looking to the future, in late June I announced APS’s organizational changes and promotions to strengthen our leadership team and further enhance our operations.  First, APS President, Don Robinson will continue as a Senior Advisor and join me in the newly-created Office of Procurement while handing off his day-to-day operational responsibilities.  
Second, Mark Schiavoni has been named Executive Vice President of Operations.  In his new role, Mark has responsibility of r operations except for nuclear generation and customer service.  Mark joined APS in 2009 ,bringing strong experience running Exelon’s Fossil Fleet and also at nuclear operations at two other utilities.  
Third, Jeff Guldner was named Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulation.  This move combines our customer service organization and APS’s interactions with Arizona and federal utility regulators under Jeff’s guidance.  To date, Jeff has successfully headed our rate regulation efforts including leading the team that negotiated the 2009 and 2012 retail rate settlements.  
Fourth, the Information Technology organization now reports to Jim Hatfield who will focus that important group on increased efficiency and effectiveness that will benefit our entire company.  In addition, we have hired a new Senior Executive in IT who brings impressive experience in this regard from a major financial services company.  
Finally, there were several senior manager promotions that will realign some of our operational areas under proven leaders.  I believe these changes to the senior management team support our company-wide focus on best practices and continuous improvement.  
Over the past several years we have often spoke about cost management.  Following the theme of continuous improvement, we will continue to look for ways to improve our cost while maintaining safety and operational excellence.  
We have cross-functional management initiatives underway, co-headed by Jiim Hatfield and Mark Schiavoni.  Jim will discuss those initiatives momentarily.  
To close my remarks, I’m very please where our company is today and very optimistic about our future.  With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue achieving top-tier performance through focus on excellence and execution and continuous improvement, something our talented leadership team and workforce do exceptionally well.  
Now, Jim will review our second quarter results, credit rating upgrades and financing plans, the outlook for this Arizona economy, our cost management initiatives and our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financial outlook through the stay-out period.  Jim?

296957,214377682,338208,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don.  As Don said, we continue making progress strengthening our financial profile.  Today I will discuss the following topics.  First, I will discuss our second quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year’s c",1943,"Thank you, Don.  As Don said, we continue making progress strengthening our financial profile.  Today I will discuss the following topics.  First, I will discuss our second quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year’s corresponding quarter.  Second, I will review recent upgrades of our credit ratings and our financing plans.  Third, I’ll provide an update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy.  Fourth, I will describe our cost management initiatives to which Don referred.  And finally, I will discuss our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financials during the stay-out.  
Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter.  On a GAAP basis for this year’s second quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of 122 million, or $1.11 per share compared with net income of 87 million or $0.79 per share for last year’s second quarter.  Our ongoing earnings increased $0.34 per share.  For this year’s second quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of 123 million or $1.12 per share versus ongoing earnings of 86 million or $0.78 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.  
Slide 7 contains a reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share.  The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate and our energy services businesses.  My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.  
Slide 8, this displays the variances that grow the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share.  First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.35 per share compared with the prior year’s second quarter earnings.  Several pluses and minuses comprise of positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.  
Second, lower infrastructure-related costs improved earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.  These costs reductions were partially offset by higher property taxes related to tax-rate increased.  
Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.05 per share.  The expense increase was largely due to stock compensation costs resulting from improvements in the company’s stock price.  This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard, or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.  
Fourth, the net impact of miscellaneous other items decreased earnings by $0.02 per share.  Our second quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun program and plans that were placed in service late last year and early this year.  This net variance is reflected in various line items on the income statement.  
Turning to Slide 9, and the components of the net increase in our gross margins, total gross margin increased $0.35 per share compared with last year’s second quarter.  The main components of that increase were as follows:  The effect of weather variations improved earnings by $0.23 per share.  This year’s second quarter was hotter than normal while the 2011 second quarter was abnormally mild.  This year, residents of cooling degree days were 14% higher than normal and 51% over the comparable quarter a year ago.  The retail transmission cost adjusted rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.05 per share.  Lower fuel and purchased power costs and higher mark-to-market valuations of APS’s fuel hedges net of related PCA deferrals improved earnings by $0.04.  
The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.04 per share.  Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hours sales decreased our earnings by $0.01 per share.  This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 0.9% over year-ago levels.  
Slide 10 displays our investment-grade credit ratings.  In May after approval of the retail rate settlement, both Moody’s and Fitch rate Pinnacle West and APS long-term credit ratings up one notch including an upgrade of APS’s senior unsecured debt to Baa1 and BBB+ respectively.  We are pleased the rating industry recognizes constructive conservatory outcome and are improving financial performance.  
Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt upon the acquisition of SoCal Edison’s interest in Four Corners later this year if the transaction is consummated.  With respect to potential equity issuances, [inaudible] successful completion of the retail rate settlement, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest.  The timing of any amount - the timing and amount of any issuance would facilitate balancing of APS’s capital structure and provide support for the company’s credit metrics.  
Turing to Slide 11 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy.  Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the second quarter although the growth remains modest as has been the case for the last several quarters.  
As shown on Slide 11, growth in non-farm jobs continue to show modest gains.  In particular, the rate of overall job growth was - has held up well for over a year and virtually all the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth.  The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending and has pushed the unemployment rate down parallel with national trends.  However, as I have discussed on previous calls, significant headwinds remain to be overcome before we can expect the Arizona economy to begin growing robustly.  While consumer spending is above last year’s levels, the rate of growth has declined I recent months, unemployment remains persistently high and the amount of unoccupied housing continues to restrain the new home construction market. 
On Slide 11, you can see our estimates of the amount of excess housing that presently exists in our service territory and metro Phoenix.  The good news is that the Phoenix economy has absorbed about 10,000 vacant homes and apartments since the peak of [inaudible] in 2009.  We believe we are on a page to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level of our existing home resale price will be more supportive of new home construction.  
On Slide 12, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in [inaudible] repeat sales index.  In recent months we have seen a slight rebound in pricing as the number of foreclosure sales have declined.  While we view this as a positive trend, we also recognize that the single-family retail pricing has just recently returned to levels that we saw in early 2010, just past the peak of the recession.  More importantly, these price levels are consist with the market for homes at the end of 2001 or 11 years ago.  
This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market.  As you can see on the slide, vacant rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels but remain quite high.  Again, we view this as a positive trend but believe that to the extent of vacant space in these markets means that the recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.  
Reflecting this modest steady improvement in economic conditions, APS’s customer base grew 0.9% in this year’s second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago and represents the strongest growth we’ve seen in three years.  
Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona’s growth are still here and that our growth rate and customers will return to more typical levels.  Looking at the next several years, we see current - we currently expect the annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 to 2015 with growth rates higher at the end of the period than in the near term for reasons I just discussed.  
Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat in 2012 to 2015 primarily due to customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.  
Turing to Slide 13 and our cost management initiatives.  We are building on the cost management foundation with solid achievements in recent years.  As this slide shows, we have been able to hold O&M essentially flat since 2008.  In preparation for the recently settled rate case, we reduced capital and operational spending by more than 30 million per year through several efforts such as our enterprise-wide supply chain initiative.  However, we are cognizant that we cannot let cost escalate unchecked as customer growth and sales improve.  Our goal is to keep O&M growth in line with retail sales growth.  However, we will not sacrifice safety or operational excellence in order to do so.  
To achieve continuous improvement, we’re challenging employees throughout the company to find ways to be more efficient and effective in their jobs.  Additionally, we have a number of corporate initiatives.  A company-wide cross-functional initiative underway to benchmark and evaluate various activities.  Recently we have identified and eliminated some duplication of efforts. For example, we have combined financial business analyst groups in my organization by consolidating previously these centralized functions, we were able to create significant synergies.  Further, progress is being made on cross-functional processes which will also create significant synergies.  
Workforce attrition will provide opportunity to capitalize on efficiencies without the need for large layoffs.  We estimate that more than 220 will leave the company in each of the next 10 years due in large part to retirements as the baby boomers transition to the next phase of their lives.  Through process improvements, we believe that we will be able to avoid replacing a significant number of those employees.  To minimize a loss of key knowledge as our workforce changes, we are implementing programs to enhance knowledge transfer and ensure consistency and documentation of processes.  
Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook.  As shown on Slide 14, we currently expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of 3.35 to 3.50 per share.  Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing in earnings per share.  
The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on Slide 16 in the appendix to today’s slide.  
Looking ahead through the base rate stay-out period, the company’s goal is to achieve an annual consolidated rate of return, average common equity of at least 9.5% on average  through 2015 as shown on Slide 14.  This represents another step change in returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement.  This expectation reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined in Slide 17 and 18.  
In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion through 2015.  However, approximately 45% will be addressed by the rate mechanisms Don alluded to and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow.  This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.  
In closing, we are confident in achieving our financial objectives through the stay-out period.  The gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated cost management ability give us this confidence.  
Additionally, but not assumed in our outlook, an accelerated return to our economic growth provide outside out outlook.  
This concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, we would be pleased to take questions.

Since our last conference call we’ve made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business.  This progress includes demonstrating improvement in the regulatory environment in Arizona, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery.  Jim and I will provide more information on each of these areas through our remarks today.
The regulatory environment in Arizona took another step forward when APS’s retail rate settlement was approved on May 15th by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  The decision came 11 ½ months after the case was filed, the quickest resolution of a major Arizona utility rate case in recent memory.  Supported by 22 of the 24 active parties to the case, the settlement shows significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the Arizona Corporation Commission and other parties as well as a comprehensive commitment to an expedited process.
The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.  Details of the agreement, as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.
The settlement prevents base rates from increasing for 4 years, but it is not a rate freeze.  Under the agreement, APS may file its next general rate case on or after May 31st of 2015 for new base rates to become effective on or after July 1st of 2016.  That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during the stay-out period.
Aspects related to that settlement include first APS’s rate adjustment mechanisms.  All of APS’s rate adjustors will continue to function throughout the stay-out period.  These mechanism include, among others, first the preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjuster, which beginning in 2013 can pass annual changes in the preferred formula rate to APS retail customers without explicit ACC approval because of the settlement.
Next, the renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions and then the lossed fixed cost recovery mechanisms, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed costs related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation.
And finally, an enhanced environmental improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying costs on government-mandated environmental capital projects.  Second, a carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition.  This provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013 if the acquisition is consummated as we currently plan.  I will review our progress in the Four Corners plan momentarily.
Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases.  These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases and 100% pass through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster.
And finally, without a time-sensitive base rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and discipline cost management.
This settlement builds upon a constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provides financial support for APS that will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next 4 years.
In a related manner, on July 18th, the Arizona Commission approved the 2012 retail transmission cost adjuster increase.  The rate change, which became effective August 1st will increase annual revenues $18 million.  As I mentioned earlier, beginning next year, any future changes can automatically go into effect June 1st of each year without separate Arizona Commission action.
We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with the Arizona Corporate Commission and various stakeholders to further influence the state’s regulatory framework and define solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
Our selective capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS’s electricity customers while meeting goals for Arizona’s sustainable energy future and environmental compliance.
I’ll update you on 2 major components of our capital expenditures program; the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition.  Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program are important measured steps towards advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future.  Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.
A summary of the program is included in the appendix to today’s slides.  This program is progressing on target.  To date, we have placed in commercial operation 3 plants with a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity.  Construction and other development activities are currently underway at 2 sites for another 54 megawatts.  We plan to place 19 megawatts into service late this year and the remainder into operation in 2013.
Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.
We are continuing to make progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico.  A summary of that plan is included in the appendix to today’s slides.  The plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially.  The acquisition requires approvals from Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies, most of which have been obtained.  Noteworthy conditions that remain to be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of a new coal supply contract reasonably acceptable to APS and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  We continue to target closing of the acquisition late this year.
In addition to strategic capital investments, excellence in day-to-day execution remains a top priority.  In the second quarter, our operating results reflected that priority.  Palo Verde operated at a 93% capacity factor, reflecting a portion of the planned refueling outage at Unit 3, which was completed on April 17th in 32 days.  The facility’s second shortest refueling outage to date.
On the customer service side of our business, JD Power and Associates released the results of this year’s residential customer survey last month.  I am pleased that APS was ranked third best among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities, continuing the recognition of our excellence and overall customer satisfaction.
More specific to our region, we were ranked second among the ten investor-owned utilities in the West.
Looking to the future, in late June I announced APS’s organizational changes and promotions to strengthen our leadership team and further enhance our operations.  First, APS President, Don Robinson will continue as a Senior Advisor and join me in the newly-created Office of Procurement while handing off his day-to-day operational responsibilities.
Second, Mark Schiavoni has been named Executive Vice President of Operations.  In his new role, Mark has responsibility for operations except for nuclear generation and customer service.  Mark joined APS in 2009 ,bringing strong experience running Exelon’s Fossil Fleet and also at nuclear operations at 2 other utilities.
Third, Jeff Guldner was named Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulation.  This move combines our customer service organization and APS’s interactions with Arizona and federal utility regulators under Jeff’s guidance.  To date, Jeff has successfully headed our rate regulation efforts including leading the team that negotiated the 2009 and 2012 retail rate settlements.
Fourth, the Information Technology organization now reports to Jim Hatfield who will focus that important group on increased efficiency and effectiveness that will benefit our entire company.  In addition, we have hired a new Senior Executive in IT who brings impressive experience in this regard from a major financial services company.
Finally, there were several senior manager promotions that will realign some of our operational areas under proven leaders.  I believe these changes to the senior management team support our company-wide focus on best practices and continuous improvement.
Over the past several years we have often spoke about cost management.  Following the theme of continuous improvement, we will continue to look for ways to improve our cost while maintaining safety and operational excellence.
We have cross-functional cross-management initiatives underway, co-headed by Jiim Hatfield and Mark Schiavoni.  Jim will discuss those initiatives momentarily.
To close my remarks, I’m very please where our company is today and very optimistic about our future.  With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue achieving top-tier performance through focus on excellence and execution and continuous improvement, something our talented leadership team and workforce do exceptionally well.
Now, Jim will review our second quarter results, credit rating upgrades and financing plans, the outlook for this Arizona economy, our cost management initiatives and our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financial outlook through the stay-out period.  Jim?"
296957,214377682,338781,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don.

As Don said, we continue making progress strengthening our financial profile.  Today I will discuss the following topics.

Second, I will review recent upgrades to our credit ratings and our financing plans.  Third, I’ll provide an update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy.  Fourth, I will describe our cost management initiatives to which Don referred.  And finally, I will discuss our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financials during the stay-out.
Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter.  On a GAAP basis for this year’s second quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of 122 million, or $1.11 per share compared with net income of 87 million or $0.79 per share for last year’s second quarter.  Our ongoing earnings increased $0.34 per share.  For this year’s second quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of 123 million or $1.12 per share versus ongoing earnings of 86 million or $0.78 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide 7 contains a reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share.  The amount for both quarters excluded results related to our discontinued real estate and our energy services businesses.  My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.
Slide 8 displays the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share.  First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.35 per share compared with the prior year’s second quarter earnings.  Several pluses and minuses comprise this positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower infrastructure-related costs improved earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.  These costs reductions were partially offset by higher property taxes related to tax-rate increases.
Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.05 per share.  The expense increase was largely due to stock compensation costs resulting from improvements in the company’s stock price.  This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard, or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.
Fourth, the net impact of miscellaneous other items decreased earnings by $0.02 per share.  Our second quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun program and plants that were placed in service late last year and early this year.  This net variance is reflected in various line items on the income statement.
Turning to Slide 9, and the components of the net increase in our gross margins, total gross margin increased $0.35 per share compared with last year’s second quarter.  The main components of that increase were as follows:  The effect of weather variations improved earnings by $0.23 per share.  This year’s second quarter was hotter than normal while the 2011 second quarter was abnormally mild.  This year, residents of cooling degree days were 14% higher than normal and 51% over the comparable quarter a year ago.  The retail transmission cost adjusted rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.05 per share.  Lower fuel and purchased power costs and higher mark-to-market valuations of APS’s fuel hedges net of related PCA deferrals improved earnings by $0.04.
The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.04 per share.  Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hours sales decreased our earnings by $0.01 per share.  This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 0.9% over year-ago levels.
Slide 10 displays our investment-grade credit ratings.  In May after approval of the retail rate settlement, both Moody’s and Fitch raised Pinnacle West and APS long-term credit ratings up one notch including an upgrade of APS’s senior unsecured debt to Baa1 and BBB+ respectively.  We are pleased the rating industry recognized this constructive conservatory outcome and are improving financial performance.
Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt upon the acquisition of SoCal Edison’s interest in Four Corners later this year if the transaction is consummated.  With respect to potential equity issuances, finally the successful completion of the retail rate settlement, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest.  The timing of any amount - the timing and amount of any issuance would facilitate balancing of APS’s capital structure and provide support for the company’s credit metrics.
Turing to Slide 11 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy.  Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the second quarter although the growth remains modest as has been the case for the last several quarters.
As shown on Slide 11, growth in non-farm jobs continue to show modest gains.  In particular, the rate of overall job growth was - has held up well for over 1 year and virtually all the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth.  The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending and has pushed the unemployment rate down and parallel with national trends.  However, as I have discussed on previous calls, significant headwinds remain to be overcome before we can expect the Arizona economy to begin growing robustly.  While consumer spending is above last year’s levels, the rate of growth has declined in recent months, unemployment remains persistently high and the amount of unoccupied housing continues to restrain the new home construction market.
On Slide 11, you can see our estimates of the amount of excess housing that presently exists in our service territory in Metro Phoenix.  The good news is that the Phoenix economy has absorbed about 10,000 vacant homes and apartments since the peak of vacancies was reached in 2009.  We believe we are on a page to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level where existing home resale pricing will be more supportive of new home construction.
On Slide 12, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in the Kay Shiller repeat sales index.  In recent months we have seen a slight rebound in pricing as the number of foreclosure sales have declined.  While we view this as a positive trend, we also recognize that the single-family retail pricing has just recently returned to levels that we saw in early 2010, just past the peak of the recession.  More importantly, these price levels are consistent with the market for homes at the end of 2001 or 11 years ago.
This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market.  As you can see on the slide, vacant rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels but remain quite high.  Again, we view this as a positive trend but believe that to the extent of vacant space in these markets means that the recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.
Reflecting this modest steady improvement in economic conditions, APS’s customer base grew 0.9% in this year’s second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago and represents the strongest growth we’ve seen in 3 years.
Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona’s growth are still here and that our growth rate and customers will return to more typical levels.  Looking at the next several years, we see current - we currently expect the annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 to 2015 with growth rates higher at the end of the period than in the near term for reasons I just discussed.
Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat in 2012 to 2015 primarily due to customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.
Turing to Slide 13 and our cost management initiatives.  We are building on the cost management foundation with solid achievements in recent years.  As this slide shows, we have been able to hold O&M essentially flat since 2008.  In preparation for the recently settled rate case, we reduced capital and operational spending by more than 30 million per year through several efforts such as our enterprise-wide supply chain initiative.  However, we are cognizant that we cannot let cost escalate unchecked as customer growth and sales improve.  Our goal is to keep O&M growth in line with retail sales growth.  However, we will not sacrifice safety or operational excellence in order to do so.
To achieve continuous improvement, we’re challenging employees throughout the company to find ways to be more efficient and effective in their jobs.  Additionally, we have a number of corporate initiatives.  A company-wide cross-functional initiative is underway to benchmark and evaluate various activities.  Recently we have identified and eliminated some duplication of efforts. For example, we have combined financial business analyst groups in the Myer [ph] organization by consolidating previously decentralized functions, we were able to create significant synergies.  Further, progress is being made on cross-functional processes which will also create significant synergies.
Workforce attrition will provide opportunity to capitalize on efficiencies without the need for large layoffs.  We estimate that more than 220 will leave the company in each of the next 10 years due in large part to retirements as the baby boomers transition to the next phase of their lives.  Through process improvements, we believe that we will be able to avoid replacing a significant number of those employees.  To minimize a loss of key knowledge as our workforce changes, we are implementing programs to enhance knowledge transfer and ensure consistency and documentation of processes.
Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook.  As shown on Slide 14, we currently expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50 per share.  Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing in earnings per share.
The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on Slide 16 in the appendix to today’s slide.
Looking ahead through the base rate stay-out period, the company’s goal is to achieve an annual consolidated rate of return on average common equity of at least 9.5% on average through 2015 as shown on Slide 14.  This represents another step change in returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement.  This expectation reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined in Slide 17 and 18.
In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion to 2015.  However, approximately 45% will be addressed by the rate mechanisms Don alluded to and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow.  This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.
In closing, we are confident in achieving our financial objectives through the stay-out period.  The gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated cost management ability give us this confidence.
Additionally, but not assumed in our outlook, an accelerated return to our economic growth provide outside to our outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, we would be pleased to take questions."

Since our last conference call we’ve made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business. This progress includes demonstrating improvement in the regulatory environment in Arizona, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery. Jim and I will provide more information on each of these areas through our remarks today.
The regulatory environment in Arizona took another step forward when APS’s retail rate settlement was approved on May 15th by the Arizona Corporation Commission. The decision came 11 ½ months after the case was filed, the quickest resolution of a major Arizona utility rate case in recent memory. Supported by 22 of the 24 active parties to the case, the settlement shows significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the Arizona Corporation Commission and other parties as well as a comprehensive commitment to an expedited process.
The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Details of the agreement, as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.
The settlement prevents base rates from increasing for 4 years, but it is not a rate freeze. Under the agreement, APS may file its next general rate case on or after May 31st of 2015 for new base rates to become effective on or after July 1st of 2016. That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during the stay-out period.
Aspects related to that settlement include first APS’s rate adjustment mechanisms. All of APS’s rate adjustors will continue to function throughout the stay-out period. These mechanism include, among others, first the preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjuster, which beginning in 2013 can pass annual changes in the preferred formula rate to APS retail customers without explicit ACC approval because of the settlement.
Next, the renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions and then the loss fixed cost recovery mechanisms, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed costs related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation.
And finally, an enhanced environmental improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying costs on government-mandated environmental capital projects. Second, a carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition. This provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013 if the acquisition is consummated as we currently plan. I will review our progress in the Four Corners plan momentarily.
Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases. These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases and 100% pass through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster. And finally, without a time-sensitive base rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and discipline cost management.
This settlement builds upon a constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provides financial support for APS that will help us achieve Arizona’s energy goals over the next 4 years.
In a related manner, on July 18th, the Arizona Commission approved the 2012 retail transmission cost adjuster increase. The rate change, which became effective August 1st will increase annual revenues $18 million. As I mentioned earlier, beginning next year, any future changes can automatically go into effect June 1st of each year without separate Arizona Commission action.
We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with the Arizona Corporate Commission and various stakeholders to further influence the state’s regulatory framework and define solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
Our selective capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS’s electricity customers while meeting goals for Arizona’s sustainable energy future and environmental compliance.
I’ll update you on 2 major components of our capital expenditures program; the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition. Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program are important measured steps towards advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future. Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.
A summary of the program is included in the appendix to today’s slides. This program is progressing on target. To date, we have placed in commercial operation 3 plants with a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity. Construction and other development activities are currently underway at 2 sites for another 54 megawatts. We plan to place 19 megawatts into service late this year and the remainder into operation in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.
We are continuing to make progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison’s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico. A summary of that plan is included in the appendix to today’s slides. The plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. The acquisition requires approvals from Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies, most of which have been obtained. Noteworthy conditions that remain to be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of a new coal supply contract reasonably acceptable to APS and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We continue to target closing of the acquisition late this year.
In addition to strategic capital investments, excellence in day-to-day execution remains a top priority. In the second quarter, our operating results reflected that priority. Palo Verde operated at a 93% capacity factor, reflecting a portion of the planned refueling outage at Unit 3, which was completed on April 17th in 32 days. The facility’s second shortest refueling outage to date.
On the customer service side of our business, JD Power and Associates released the results of this year’s residential customer survey last month. I am pleased that APS was ranked third best among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities, continuing the recognition of our excellence and overall customer satisfaction. More specific to our region, we were ranked second among the 10 investor-owned utilities in the West.
Looking to the future, in late June I announced APS’s organizational changes and promotions to strengthen our leadership team and further enhance our operations. First, APS President, Don Robinson will continue as a Senior Advisor and join me in the newly-created Office of Procurement while handing off his day-to-day operational responsibilities.
Second, Mark Schiavoni has been named Executive Vice President of Operations. In his new role, Mark has responsibility for operations except for nuclear generation and customer service. Mark joined APS in 2009 ,bringing strong experience running Exelon’s Fossil Fleet and also at nuclear operations at 2 other utilities.
Third, Jeff Guldner was named Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulation. This move combines our customer service organization and APS’s interactions with Arizona and federal utility regulators under Jeff’s guidance. To date, Jeff has successfully headed our rate regulation efforts including leading the team that negotiated the 2009 and 2012 retail rate settlements.
Fourth, the Information Technology organization now reports to Jim Hatfield who will focus that important group on increased efficiency and effectiveness that will benefit our entire company. In addition, we have hired a new Senior Executive in IT who brings impressive experience in this regard from a major financial services company.
Finally, there were several senior manager promotions that will realign some of our operational areas under proven leaders. I believe these changes to the senior management team support our company-wide focus on best practices and continuous improvement.
Over the past several years we have often spoke about cost management. Following the theme of continuous improvement, we will continue to look for ways to improve our cost while maintaining safety and operational excellence. We have cross-functional cross-management initiatives underway, co-headed by Jim Hatfield and Mark Schiavoni. Jim will discuss those initiatives momentarily.
To close my remarks, I’m very please where our company is today and very optimistic about our future. With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue achieving top-tier performance through focus on excellence and execution and continuous improvement, something our talented leadership team and workforce do exceptionally well.
Now, Jim will review our second quarter results, credit rating upgrades and financing plans, the outlook for this Arizona economy, our cost management initiatives and our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financial outlook through the stay-out period. Jim?"

As Don said, we continue making progress strengthening our financial profile. Today I will discuss the following topics. First, I will discuss our second quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will review recent upgrades to our credit ratings and our financing plans. Third, I’ll provide an update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy. Fourth, I will describe our cost management initiatives to which Don referred. And finally, I will discuss our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financials during the stay-out.
Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year’s second quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of 122 million, or $1.11 per share compared with net income of 87 million or $0.79 per share for last year’s second quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.34 per share. For this year’s second quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of 123 million or $1.12 per share versus ongoing earnings of 86 million or $0.78 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Slide 7 contains a reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amount for both quarters excluded results related to our discontinued real estate and our energy services businesses. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.
Slide 8 displays the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.35 per share compared with the prior year’s second quarter earnings. Several pluses and minuses comprise this positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower infrastructure-related costs improved earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. These costs reductions were partially offset by higher property taxes related to tax-rate increases.
Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. The expense increase was largely due to stock compensation costs resulting from improvements in the company’s stock price. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard, or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.
Fourth, the net impact of miscellaneous other items decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. Our second quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun program and plants that were placed in service late last year and early this year. This net variance is reflected in various line items on the income statement.
Turning to Slide 9, and the components of the net increase in our gross margins, total gross margin increased $0.35 per share compared with last year’s second quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows: The effect of weather variations improved earnings by $0.23 per share. This year’s second quarter was hotter than normal while the 2011 second quarter was abnormally mild. This year, residents of cooling degree days were 14% higher than normal and 51% over the comparable quarter a year ago. The retail transmission cost adjusted rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.05 per share. Lower fuel and purchased power costs and higher mark-to-market valuations of APS’s fuel hedges net of related PCA deferrals improved earnings by $0.04.
The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.04 per share. Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hours sales decreased our earnings by $0.01 per share. This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 0.9% over year-ago levels.
Slide 10 displays our investment-grade credit ratings. In May after approval of the retail rate settlement, both Moody’s and Fitch raised Pinnacle West and APS long-term credit ratings up one notch including an upgrade of APS’s senior unsecured debt to Baa1 and BBB+ respectively. We are pleased the rating industry recognized this constructive conservatory outcome and are improving financial performance.
Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt upon the acquisition of SoCal Edison’s interest in Four Corners later this year if the transaction is consummated. With respect to potential equity issuances, finally the successful completion of the retail rate settlement, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest. The timing of any amount -- the timing and amount of any issuance would facilitate balancing of APS’s capital structure and provide support for the company’s credit metrics.
Turing to Slide 11 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the second quarter although the growth remains modest as has been the case for the last several quarters.
As shown on Slide 11, growth in non-farm jobs continue to show modest gains. In particular, the rate of overall job growth was -- has held up well for over 1 year and virtually all the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending and has pushed the unemployment rate down and parallel with national trends. However, as I have discussed on previous calls, significant headwinds remain to be overcome before we can expect the Arizona economy to begin growing robustly. While consumer spending is above last year’s levels, the rate of growth has declined in recent months, unemployment remains persistently high and the amount of unoccupied housing continues to restrain the new home construction market.
On Slide 11, you can see our estimates of the amount of excess housing that presently exists in our service territory in Metro Phoenix. The good news is that the Phoenix economy has absorbed about 10,000 vacant homes and apartments since the peak of vacancies was reached in 2009. We believe we are on a page to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level where existing home resale pricing will be more supportive of new home construction.
On Slide 12, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in the Kay Shiller repeat sales index. In recent months we have seen a slight rebound in pricing as the number of foreclosure sales have declined. While we view this as a positive trend, we also recognize that the single-family retail pricing has just recently returned to levels that we saw in early 2010, just past the peak of the recession. More importantly, these price levels are consistent with the market for homes at the end of 2001 or 11 years ago.
This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market. As you can see on the slide, vacant rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels but remain quite high. Again, we view this as a positive trend but believe that to the extent of vacant space in these markets means that the recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.
Reflecting this modest steady improvement in economic conditions, APS’s customer base grew 0.9% in this year’s second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago and represents the strongest growth we’ve seen in 3 years.
Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona’s growth are still here and that our growth rate and customers will return to more typical levels. Looking at the next several years, we see current -- we currently expect the annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 to 2015 with growth rates higher at the end of the period than in the near term for reasons I just discussed.
Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat in 2012 to 2015 primarily due to customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.
Turing to Slide 13 and our cost management initiatives. We are building on the cost management foundation with solid achievements in recent years. As this slide shows, we have been able to hold O&M essentially flat since 2008. In preparation for the recently settled rate case, we reduced capital and operational spending by more than 30 million per year through several efforts such as our enterprise-wide supply chain initiative. However, we are cognizant that we cannot let cost escalate unchecked as customer growth and sales improve. Our goal is to keep O&M growth in line with retail sales growth. However, we will not sacrifice safety or operational excellence in order to do so.
To achieve continuous improvement, we’re challenging employees throughout the company to find ways to be more efficient and effective in their jobs. Additionally, we have a number of corporate initiatives. A company-wide cross-functional initiative is underway to benchmark and evaluate various activities. Recently we have identified and eliminated some duplication of efforts. For example, we have combined financial business analyst groups in the Myer [ph] organization by consolidating previously decentralized functions, we were able to create significant synergies. Further, progress is being made on cross-functional processes which will also create significant synergies.
Workforce attrition will provide opportunity to capitalize on efficiencies without the need for large layoffs. We estimate that more than 220 will leave the company in each of the next 10 years due in large part to retirements as the baby boomers transition to the next phase of their lives. Through process improvements, we believe that we will be able to avoid replacing a significant number of those employees. To minimize a loss of key knowledge as our workforce changes, we are implementing programs to enhance knowledge transfer and ensure consistency and documentation of processes.
Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 14, we currently expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50 per share. Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing in earnings per share. The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on Slide 16 in the appendix to today’s slide.
Looking ahead through the base rate stay-out period, the company’s goal is to achieve an annual consolidated rate of return on average common equity of at least 9.5% on average through 2015 as shown on Slide 14. This represents another step change in returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement. This expectation reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined in Slide 17 and 18.
In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion to 2015. However, approximately 45% will be addressed by the rate mechanisms Don alluded to and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow. This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.
In closing, we are confident in achieving our financial objectives through the stay-out period. The gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated cost management ability give us this confidence.
Additionally, but not assumed in our outlook, an accelerated return to our economic growth provide outside to our outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would be pleased to take questions."

This year we've made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business.
This progress includes demonstrating sustained improvement in the regulatory environment in Arizona, making selective capital investments, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery. Jim and I will provide more information on each of these areas throughout our remarks today.
APS's retail rate settlement, which was approved earlier this year became effective on July 1. Details of the agreement as well as the key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides.
The settlement demonstrates significant collaboration and cooperation among APS peers on a Corporation Commission and other stakeholders as well as a proven commitment to expedite the retail rate case process. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.
Among other things, first, it provides a financial support APS needs to meet our customers' energy needs and to help achieve Arizona's energy goals. Second, the settlement provides measure of regulatory certainty for both customers and shareholders through at least mid-2016. Third, it provides rate gradualism through the use of a number of rate adjustment mechanisms. This process will void the need for base rate increases every several years, while allowing reasonable recovery that APS has prudently incurred expenditures in the interim. And fourth, it allows APS the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity.
That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during this out-period. Aspects related to the settlement include, first, APS's rate adjustment mechanisms, which will continue to function throughout the stay-out period. Among others, these mechanism include preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjuster, which passes annual changes in the formula rate through their APS retail customers.
The renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions, and other renewable resourced program costs, the new loss fixed cost recovery mechanism, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed cost related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation. And an enhanced environment improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying cost on government-mandated environmental capital projects.
Second, a rate rider carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition, and this provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013, after the acquisition is consummated. I will review the status of the Four Corners plan momentarily.
Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases. These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases as well as full pass-through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster. And finally, without a time-intensive rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and disciplined cost management.
In a related manner, on August 1, APS implemented an ACC approved increase in the retail transmission cost adjuster. The rate change reflected APS's increased investment in transmission lines and will increase annual formula-based revenues by $18 million. Beginning next year, the settlement allows future transmission cost adjuster changes to go into effect June 1 of each year without requiring the expressed Commission action. This change will synchronize wholesale and retail transmission cost recovery.
Turning into next week selections, three of the five ACC Commission seats are on the ballot. Incumbent Commissioners, Sandra Kennedy, Paul Newman and Bob Stump are running for reelection. In addition, three challengers are also running for the seats. Republican, Susan Bitter Smith and Bob Burns; and Democrat, Marcia Busching.
Regardless of the party affiliation, the three candidates who receive the highest number of votes will win the election and begin four-year terms in January. Whatever the results of the elections, we will continue working with the Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to continue our collaborative focus on the states energy future.
Our capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS's electricity customers, while meeting goals for Arizona's sustainable energy future and environmental compliance. Today I'll update you on two major components of our capital expenditures program, the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition.
Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program are important, measured steps toward advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future. Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale, photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.
This program is progressing on target. To date, we have commitments in place for a total of 118 megawatts with a projected capital investment of $504 million. A summary of the program is included in the appendix to our slides.
To date, we have placed three plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 50 megawatts. Construction and other development activities are currently underway at three sites for another 68 megawatts. Of this amount, we plan to place 19 megawatts at the Chino Valley site in Northern Arizona into service later this year. We expect the reminder will go into operation in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.
We are continuing with our plan to acquire Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico. A summary of the plant is included in the appendix to our slides. The plant has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. The acquisition requires approvals by Arizona, California and federal regulators as we as other government agencies, most of which have already been obtained.
Noteworthy conditions still must be met prior to closing the transaction, including approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and negotiation of a new coal supply contract. We expect to hear from them first by the end of this month, and coal contract negotiations are continuing. We intend to close the acquisition following satisfactory completion of these conditions.
Excellence in day-to-day operations remains our top priority and our third quarter results reflect this focus. Throughout the summer, our generating fleet turned in solid performance, and our employees provided high-quality service, all of them meeting and demands of our peak season.
During the third quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear plant operated as a 98% capacity factor. Currently, Unit 2 is in a planned refueling outage, which we've expected to be completed early this month, reflecting a schedule of approximately 30 days. Our fossil plants also operated well. When appropriate, we took advantage of low near-term natural gas prices by reducing output by our coal plants and increasing gas plant production.
In September, we were again recognized for our sustainable business practices as Pinnacle West was name to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Our company has been included in the index for eight consecutive years. Every year since the index was established and is one on only nine North American electric utilities included in the current index listing.
Over the past several years, we have achieved a number of needed improvements to strengthen the company's balance sheet and other aspects of our financial profile, while focusing on continuous improvement in operations to regulatory framework and cost management. Continuous improvement is essential to maintaining operational excellence and they are achieving our current and future financial goals.
Last month we achieved another milestone, when our Board of Directors improved the cash component of return for our shareholders by increasing the common dividend by about 4% effective with this year's December payment. The board's decision to increase our dividend demonstrates the confidence we have in the fundamental strength of our business, the Arizona communities we serve and our future growth prospects. We are focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth and strong cash returns to shareholders.
To close my remarks, I am very pleased with where our company is today and very optimistic about our future. With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue to achieve top-tier performance through our day-to-day focus on excellence in execution and continuous improvement, areas in which our talented leadership team and workforce performed exceptionally well.
Now, Jim will review our third quarter results, the outlook for the Arizona economy and our guidance for 2012 earnings.

As Don said, we continue making progress, strengthening our financial profile. Today I'll discuss the following topics: first, I'll review our third quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year's corresponding quarter; second, I'll provide an update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy; and finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook during the retail base rate stay-out period.
Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year's third quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $245 million or $2.21 per share compared with net income of $255 million or $2.32 per share for last year's third quarter.
Our ongoing earnings were comparable to last year's third quarter. For this year's quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $245 million or $2.21 per share versus ongoing earnings of $246 million or $2.24 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
Slide 7 reconciliations our third quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amounts for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued energy services and real estate businesses. The most significant item excluded is a $10 million gain on the sale of our energy services business in last year's third quarter.
My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results. Slide 8 displays variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.16 per share compared with the prior-year third quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprised as positive net variance. And I'll cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower infrastructure-related cost improved earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. These cost reductions were primarily offset by higher property taxes related to tax rate increases.
Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.10 per share. The expense increase primarily consisted of: an increase in employee benefit cost; the effects of beginning amortization in this year's third quarter of pension and other post retirement benefit cost compared with deferral of such cost in 2011, pursuant to APS's retail regulatory settlements; and higher fossil generation cost resulting from more plant maintenance being completed in the third quarter of this year than in the same quarter a year ago. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.
Fourth, the absence of certain items that reduced the company's effective tax rate in the third quarter of last year, reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. For example, the federal research and experimentation credit expired at the end of 2011. And it's not yet been extended by Congress, although we expect them to do so.
Additionally, last year's third quarter reflected tax benefits of a non-cash charitable contribution. The net impact of other miscellaneous items decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. Our third quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun plants that were placed in service late last year and early this year. The net variance is reflected in various line items throughout the income statement.
Turning to Slide 9 and the components of the net increase in our gross margin, total gross margin increased $0.16 per share compared with last year's third quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows: the APS's retail regulatory settlement, which became effective July 1, improved gross margin by $0.21 per share, all of which was comprised of a non-fuel base rate increase. The company also stopped recording, line extension fees received as revenues, when the 2012 settlement became effective.
Retail transmission revenue increases improved earnings by $0.09 per share. The transmission cost adjuster increase that became effective August 1, improved earnings by $0.02 per share.
Additionally, in last year's third quarter, we booked a catch-up adjustment to our formula rates that reduce 2011 third quarter results by $0.04 per share. By comparison, the absence of that adjustment in this year's third quarter, improved the quarter-to-quarter comparison.
Finally, the procedures for processing future retail rate adjustments have been streamlined by the 2012 retail rate settlement, thereby allowing APS to accrue the estimated effects of a change in next year's formula transmission revenues. The balance of that variance is primarily comprised of these accruals. The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.05 per share.
The effects of cooler weather reduced earnings by $0.17 per share. This year's third quarter was milder than normal, while the 2011 quarter was abnormally hot. This year residential cooling degree days were 15% lower than last year's third quarter, and 5% below normal.
Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales decreased our earnings by $0.02 per share. This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 1.2% over year ago levels.
Turning to Slide 10 and 11, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy, economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the third quarter. Although, the growth remains modest as has been the case for last several quarters.
As shown on Slide 10, growth in non-farm jobs continued to show improvement. The rate of overall job growth is increasing certainly, and has been consistently positive for the last two years. Virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth, and the rate of growth is two-thirds faster than the rate seen in the nation as a whole.
The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending, and has pushed the unemployment rate down generally in parallel with national trends. While these trends are positive, we believe that we still have a few more quarters to go before we see local markets returning to a more normal condition.
On Slide 10, you can see our estimate of the amount of vacant homes and apartments that presently exist in our service territory in Metro Phoenix. Vacancies have retreated by 35% from their peak in May 2009 and early 2010, which has sparked some renewed interest in the single-family housing market.
Permit activity has increased in each of last five consecutive quarters and finished the third quarter of this year 20% higher than that of third quarter of last year. We believe we are on a pace to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level where existing home resell pricing will be more supportive of the new home construction.
On Slide 11, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in the case shower repeat sales index. In recent months, we have seen an up tick in existing home prices as a number of foreclosure sales have declined and the level of housing demand has improved.
Even with the slight rebound on pricing, affordability of single-family housing remains quite high by historical standards. And we believe that condition has been particularly helpful in attracting property investors to increase shareholdings in their existing stock of housing.
The decline in vacancies and foreclosures and increases in prices are evidence of the continuing, albeit slow progress of the housing market back to more normal levels. This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market. As you can see on the slide, vacancy rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels, but remain quite high. Well, those for industrial space have fallen more dramatically.
Again, we view this as a positive trend, but believe that the extent of vacant space in the office and retail markets means a recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.
On balance we see favorable, albeit modest economic indicators which paint a picture of continuing steady recovery, accompanied by sizable but diminishing hindrance. Reflecting this modest, steady improvement in economic condition, APS's customer base grew 1.2% in this year's third quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, which represents a stronger growth we've seen in three years.
Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona's growth are still here and that our growth rate in customers will return to more typical levels.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 through 2015 with growth rates higher at the end of that period than in the near term for the reasons I've just discussed. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2015, primarily due to customer conservation, energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.
Finally, I want to discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook. As shown on Slide 12, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50 per share. Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing earnings per share.
The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on in the appendix to our slides. We plan to discuss guidance for our 2013 ongoing earnings at our Analyst Day on November 9.
As Don discussed, last month, our Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.08 per share or about 4% to $2.18 per share effective with the December payment.
Slide 13 depicts our longer term financial outlook to the base rate stay-out period. The company expects to achieve an annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of at least 9.5% through 2015, compared with APS's allowed return on equity of 10% under the settlement agreement.
This level represents another step change in earned returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement as well as our operational excellence and cost management initiatives. This goal reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined on Slide 16 and 17.
In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion annually through 2015. However, approximately 45% of this amount will be recovered through the rate mechanisms that Don outlined and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow. This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.
Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt to fund the acquisition of SoCal Edison's interest in Four Corners at closing of that plant. With respect to any potential equity issuances, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest.
Under the current schedule, the timing and amount of issuance would facilitate calibration of APS's capital structure for the next general rate case which is assumed to be in mid-2015 with the 2014 test year and provide support for the company's credit metrics.
In closing, we are confident we will achieve our financial objectives during the stay-out period. A confidence supported by the gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated operational execution and cost management abilities. Additionally, our outlook conservatively assumes a slow economic recovery and accelerated return to economic growth should provide upside to our outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we would be pleased to take questions at this time.

There is no reason that couldn't change but that's traditionally been the time, if there was a reason. But I don't think we've changed it just to change it. So that's about as best answer. I think I'd focus on October for future years following some other changes.
Relative to how the management team and the board focused on the dividend, one is focus on what would we do to create the most long term value for shareholders. And in that regard, our philosophy was a change in the dividend that would appear to be the least risky, meaning, I believe and our board, the more secure that dividend of peers going forward, the more shareholder value will create with the absence of uncertainty around it. That certainly doesn't mean we're locked into this kind of an increase in the future. But I'm also not telegraphing there is any change.
But as you know we've heard the stock over the last couple of years about our cost control initiatives and the projects that Jim Hatfield, Mark Schiavoni, our team helped for us over the stay-out period, and the fact that we have 200 to 300 employees retiring each year and we're going to try to take as much advantage of those potential cost savings as possible.
And our forecast of sales is essentially flat. And it's still very early stages. There is some activity in the housing market. And as you know, we've got more than 25,000 empty homes in our service territory. And when the market starts to return to normal, whatever normal might it look like in future years, that would be potential upside to earnings, and obviously both the management team and board would take those potential positive developments in the consideration in future years.

This year we've made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business.This progress includes demonstrating sustained improvement in the regulatory environment in A",1401,"Thanks, Becky, and thank you all for joining us today. This year we've made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business.
This progress includes demonstrating sustained improvement in the regulatory environment in Arizona, making selective capital investments, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery. Jim and I will provide more information on each of these areas throughout our remarks today.
APS's retail rate settlement, which was approved earlier this year, became effective on July 1. Details of the agreement as well as the key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides.
The settlement demonstrates significant collaboration and cooperation among APS peers on a Corporation Commission and other stakeholders as well as a proven commitment to expedite the retail rate case process. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.
Among other things, first, it provides a financial support APS needs to meet our customers' energy needs and to help achieve Arizona's energy goals. Second, the settlement provides a measure of regulatory certainty for both customers and shareholders through at least mid-2016. Third, it provides rate gradualism through the use of a number of rate adjustment mechanisms. This process will avoid the need for base rate increases every several years, while allowing reasonable recovery of APS’s prudently incurred expenditures in the interim. And fourth, it allows APS the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity.
That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during this stay-out period. Aspects related to the settlement include, first, APS's rate adjustment mechanisms, which will continue to function throughout the stay-out period. Among others, these mechanism include preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjuster, which passes annual changes in the formula rate through to APS retail customers.
The renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions, and other renewable resourced program costs, the new loss fixed cost recovery mechanism, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed cost related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation. And an enhanced environment improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying cost on government-mandated environmental capital projects.
Second, a rate rider carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition, and this provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013, after the acquisition is consummated. I will review the status of the Four Corners plan momentarily.
Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases. These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases, as well as full pass-through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster. And finally, without a time-intensive rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and disciplined cost management.
In a related manner, on August 1, APS implemented an ACC approved increase in the retail transmission cost adjuster. The rate change reflected APS's increased investment in transmission lines and will increase annual formula-based revenues by $18 million. Beginning next year, the settlement allows future transmission cost adjuster changes to go into effect June 1 of each year without requiring the expressed Commission action. This change will synchronize wholesale and retail transmission cost recovery.
Turning to the next week’s elections, 3 of the 5 ACC Commission seats are on the ballot. Incumbent Commissioners, Sandra Kennedy, Paul Newman and Bob Stump are running for reelection. In addition, 3 challengers are also running for the seats. Republican, Susan Bitter Smith and Bob Burns; and Democrat, Marcia Busching.
Regardless of the party affiliation, the 3 candidates who receive the highest number of votes will win the election and begin 4-year terms in January. Whatever the results of the elections, we will continue working with the Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to continue our collaborative focus on the state’s energy future.
Our capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS's electricity customers, while meeting goals for Arizona's sustainable energy future and environmental compliance. Today I'll update you on two major components of our capital expenditures program, the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition.
Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program, are important, measured steps toward advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future. Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale, photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.
This program is progressing on target. To date, we have commitments in place for a total of 118 megawatts with a projected capital investment of $504 million. A summary of the program is included in the appendix to our slides.
To date, we have placed 3 plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 50 megawatts. Construction and other development activities are currently underway at 3 sites for another 68 megawatts. Of this amount, we plan to place 19 megawatts at the Chino Valley site in Northern Arizona into service later this year. We expect the reminder will go into operation in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.
We are continuing with our plan to acquire Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico. A summary of the plant is included in the appendix to our slides. The plant has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. The acquisition requires approvals by Arizona, California and federal regulators as well as other government agencies, most of which have already been obtained.
Noteworthy conditions still must be met prior to closing the transaction, including approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and negotiation of a new coal supply contract. We expect to hear from them first by the end of this month, and coal contract negotiations are continuing. We intend to close the acquisition following satisfactory completion of these conditions.
Excellence in day-to-day operations remains our top priority and our third quarter results reflect this focus. Throughout the summer, our generating fleet turned in solid performance, and our employees provided high-quality service, all of them meeting the demands of our peak season.
During the third quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear plant operated at a 98% capacity factor. Currently, Unit 2 is in a planned refueling outage, which we've expected to be completed early this month, reflecting a schedule of approximately 30 days. Our fossil plants also operated well. When appropriate, we took advantage of low near-term natural gas prices by reducing output by our coal plants and increasing gas plant production.
In September, we were again recognized for our sustainable business practices as Pinnacle West was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Our company has been included in the index for 8 consecutive years. Every year since the index was established and is one of only 9 North American electric utilities included in the current index listing.
Over the past several years, we have achieved a number of needed improvements to strengthen the company's balance sheet and other aspects of our financial profile, while focusing on continuous improvement in operations to regulatory framework and cost management. Continuous improvement is essential to maintaining operational excellence and they are achieving our current and future financial goals.
Last month we achieved another milestone, when our Board of Directors improved the cash component of return for our shareholders by increasing the common dividend by about 4% effective with this year's December payment. The board's decision to increase our dividend demonstrates the confidence we have in the fundamental strength of our business, the Arizona communities we serve and our future growth prospects. We are focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth and strong cash returns to shareholders.
To close my remarks, I am very pleased with where our company is today and very optimistic about our future. With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue to achieve top-tier performance through our day-to-day focus on excellence in execution and continuous improvement, areas in which our talented leadership team and workforce perform exceptionally well.
Now, Jim will review our third quarter results, the outlook for the Arizona economy and our guidance for 2012 earnings."

As Don said, we continue making progress, strengthening our financial profile. Today I'll discuss the following topics: first, I'll review our third quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year's corresponding quarter; second, I'll provide an update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy; and finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook during the retail base rate stay-out period.
Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year's third quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $245 million or $2.21 per share, compared with net income of $255 million or $2.32 per share for last year's third quarter.
Our ongoing earnings were comparable to last year's third quarter. For this year's quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $245 million or $2.21 per share versus ongoing earnings of $246 million or $2.24 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
Slide 7 reconciles our third quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amounts for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued energy services and real estate businesses. The most significant item excluded is a $10 million gain on the sale of our energy services business in last year's third quarter.
My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results. Slide 8 displays variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.16 per share compared with the prior-year third quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprised as positive net variance. And I'll cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower infrastructure-related cost improved earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. These cost reductions were primarily offset by higher property taxes related to tax rate increases.
Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.10 per share. The expense increase primarily consisted of: an increase in employee benefit cost; the effects of beginning amortization in this year's third quarter of pension and other postretirement benefit cost compared with deferral of such cost in 2011, pursuant to APS's retail regulatory settlements; and higher fossil generation cost resulting from more plant maintenance being completed in the third quarter of this year than in the same quarter a year ago. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.
Fourth, the absence of certain items that reduced the company's effective tax rate in the third quarter of last year, reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. For example, the federal research and experimentation credit expired at the end of 2011. And it's not yet been extended by Congress, although we expect them to do so.
Additionally, last year's third quarter reflected the tax benefits of a non-cash charitable contribution. The net impact of other miscellaneous items decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. Our third quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun plants that were placed in service late last year and earlier this year. The net variance is reflected in various line items throughout the income statement.
Turning to Slide 9 and the components of the net increase in our gross margin, total gross margin increased $0.16 per share compared with last year's third quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The APS's retail regulatory settlement, which became effective July 1, improved gross margin by $0.21 per share, almost all of which was comprised of a non-fuel base rate increase. The company also stopped recording line extension fees received as revenues, when the 2012 settlement became effective.
Retail transmission revenue increases improved earnings by $0.09 per share. The transmission cost adjuster increase that became effective August 1, improved earnings by $0.02 per share.
Additionally, in last year's third quarter, we booked a catch-up adjustment to our formula rates that reduce 2011 third quarter results by $0.04 per share. By comparison, the absence of that adjustment in this year's third quarter improved the quarter-to-quarter comparison.
Finally, the procedures for processing future retail rate adjustments have been streamlined by the 2012 retail rate settlement, thereby allowing APS to accrue the estimated effects of a change in next year's formula transmission revenues. The balance of that variance is primarily comprised of these accruals. The net effect of miscellaneous items improved gross margin by $0.05 per share.
The effects of cooler weather reduced earnings by $0.17 per share. This year's third quarter was milder than normal, while the 2011 quarter was abnormally hot. This year residential cooling degree days were 15% lower than last year's third quarter, and 5% below normal.
Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales decreased our earnings by $0.02 per share. This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 1.2% over year ago levels.
Turning to Slides 10 and 11, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the third quarter. Although the growth remains modest as has been the case for last several quarters.
As shown on Slide 10, growth in non-farm jobs continued to show improvement. The rate of overall job growth is increasing steadily, and has been consistently positive for the last 2 years. Virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth, and the rate of growth is 2/3 faster than the rate seen in the nation as a whole.
The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending, and has pushed the unemployment rate down, generally in parallel with national trends. While these trends are positive, we believe that we still have a few more quarters to go before we see local markets returning to a more normal condition.
On Slide 10, you can see our estimate of the amount of vacant homes and apartments that presently exist in our service territory in Metro Phoenix. Vacancies have retreated by 35% from their peak in May 2009 and early 2010, which has sparked some renewed interest in the single-family housing market.
Permit activity has increased in each of the last 5 consecutive quarters, and finished the third quarter of this year 20% higher than that of the third quarter of last year. We believe we are on a pace to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level where existing home resell pricing will be more supportive of the new home construction.
On Slide 11, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in the case shower repeat sales index. In recent months, we have seen an uptick in existing home prices as the number of foreclosure sales have declined and the level of housing demand has improved.
Even with the slight rebound on pricing, affordability of single-family housing remains quite high by historical standards. And we believe that condition has been particularly helpful in attracting property investors to increase their holdings in their existing stock of housing.
The decline in vacancies and foreclosures and increases in prices are evidence of the continuing, albeit slow, progress of the housing market back to more normal levels. This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market. As you can see on the slide, vacancy rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels, but remain quite high, while those for industrial space have fallen more dramatically.
Again, we view this as a positive trend, but believe that the extent of vacant space in the office and retail markets means a recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.
On balance we see favorable, albeit modest, economic indicators, which paint a picture of continuing steady recovery, accompanied by sizable but diminishing headwinds. Reflecting this modest, steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.2% in this year's third quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, which – and it represents the strongest growth we've seen in 3 years.
Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona's growth are still here and that our growth rate in customers will return to more typical levels.
Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 through 2015, with growth rates higher at the end of that period than in the near term for the reasons I've just discussed. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2015, primarily due to customer conservation, energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.
Finally, I want to discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook. As shown on Slide 12, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50 per share. Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing earnings per share.
The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on in the appendix to our slides. We plan to discuss guidance for our 2013 ongoing earnings at our Analyst Day on November 9.
As Don discussed, last month, our Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.08 per share or about 4% to $2.18 per share effective with the December payment.
Slide 13 depicts our longer term financial outlook to the base rate stay-out period. The company expects to achieve an annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of at least 9.5% through 2015, compared with APS's allowed return on equity of 10% under the settlement agreement.
This level represents another step change in earned returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement as well as our operational excellence and cost management initiatives. This goal reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined on Slides 16 and 17.
In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion annually through 2015. However, approximately 45% of this amount will be recovered through the rate mechanisms that Don outlined and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow. This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.
Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt to fund the acquisition of SoCal Edison's interest in Four Corners at closing of that plant. With respect to any potential equity issuances, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest.
Under the current schedule, the timing and amount of the issuance would facilitate calibration of APS's capital structure for the next general rate case, which is assumed to be in mid-2015 with the 2014 test year and provide support for the company's credit metrics.
In closing, we are confident we will achieve our financial objectives during the stay-out period, a confidence supported by the gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated operational execution and cost management abilities. Additionally, our outlook conservatively assumes a slow economic recovery and accelerated return to economic growth should provide upside to our outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we would be pleased to take questions at this time."

There is no reason that couldn't change but that's traditionally been the time, if there was a reason. But I don't think we've changed it just to change it. So that's about as best answer. I think I'd focus on October for future years, barring some other changes.
Relative to how the management team and the board focused on the dividend, one is focus on what would we do to create the most long-term value for shareholders. And in that regard, our philosophy was a change in the dividend that would appear to be the least risky, meaning, I believe and our board, the more secure that dividend appears going forward, the more shareholder value we’ll create with the absence of uncertainty around it. That certainly doesn't mean we're locked into this kind of an increase in the future. But I'm also not telegraphing there is any change.
But as you know we've heard the stock over the last couple of years about our cost control initiatives and the projects that Jim Hatfield, Mark Schiavoni, our team helped for us over the stay-out period, and the fact that we have 200 to 300 employees retiring each year and we're going to try to take as much advantage of those potential cost savings as possible.
And our forecast of sales is essentially flat. And it's still very early stages. There is some activity in the housing market. And as you know, we've got more than 25,000 empty homes in our service territory. And when the market starts to return to normal, whatever normal might look like in future years, that would be potential upside to earnings, and obviously both the management team and board would take those potential positive developments into consideration in future years."
