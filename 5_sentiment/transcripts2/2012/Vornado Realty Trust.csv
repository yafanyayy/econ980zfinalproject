There is quite a few on the phone, we are happy and delighted and that you all are joining us today. We’d appreciate your time and attention.
After my prepared remarks, Joe Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer will provide a financial overview and then we will answer your questions. We will end at approximately 2 PM. It has been a very productive quarter for us and we are making significant progress on the We Will statements made in these shareholders letter.
We have had substantial progress on simplifying the company and are committed to continue this. I would like to remind everyone that 80% of our earnings come from New York and Washington office and retails holdings where we have great platforms and great management teams.
Let’s start out by talking about asset sales. As we said in the past, we are exiting the mart business. In the second quarter we sold or contracted to sell four mart assets for $228 million, the L.A. Mart, the Boston Design Center, the Washington Design Center and the Canadian Trade Show Business.
And as a remainder, in the first quarter we completed the sale of 350 West Mart Center for coincidently $228 million. In the second quarter we also sold our Washington Office Center which is contiguous to the Washington Design Center and six non-core retail properties.
The total proceeds from second quarter sales of $500 million with a net gain of $177 million. Together with sales in the first quarter, total proceeds are $821 million with a net gain of $232 million.
In the second half of the year, we are contemplating the sale of over $1 billion of assets. Including the beginning of the mall disposition program and continuing the pruning of our strip center portfolio.
We are currently marketing Green Acres Regional Mall and Kings Plaza Regional Mall as well as our 650,000 square foot power ship center, known as the plant in San Jose California today in my field.
Let me now talk about acquisitions. In the second quarter we focused on street retail which I would like to review. First we contracted to buy 114,000 square foot retail condominium at 666 Fifth Avenue for $707 million and 4.5% going in cash cap rate and 5.6% GAAP cap rate. This deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. As you probably know, we acquired quite a co-controlling 49% interest in the 666 office condominium in December 2011.
Second, we announced last week that we entered into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts under which we will redevelop the retail and science departments of the New York Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel. This leads gives us effective control of the retail site that contains options based upon - based on cash flow which effect size (ph) will lead to our ownership and reward us for our redevelopment efforts.
The property is located in the bow tie in the heart of Times Square and snaps the entire block from 45th Street to 46th Street on Broadway directly across our iconic 1540 Broadway retail property, formerly the home of the famous Virgin Record Store in sign.
Host Hotels & Resorts slowly transformed our property where we added Disney and Forever 21 flagship stores to create a full block front of state-of-the-art dynamic LED signage.
With a short expertise, the ironic competitive process and shows us at the Marriott Marquis site, we planned to spend as much as $140 million to redevelop and substantially expand the existing retail space including converting the below-grade parking garage into retail and creating six-story eye, 300 feet wide, block front dynamic LED signs.
666 Fifth Avenue in the Marriott Marquis Retail of the Bullseye locations and the two best retail areas in Manhattan, Fifth Avenue and Times Square. Both have tremendous presence in tenant demand and we are really excited about these opportunities.
Our real estate fund acquired 167,000 square foot retail property, the western anchor of the Lincoln Road Shopping District in Miami Beach for $132 million. The Lincoln Road retail corridor in our property specifically and many of the same characteristics as our Manhattan Street retail assets.
In addition the fund acquired 112,000 square foot office building at Saint Monica for $62 million. The fund is more than half way through investing its $800 million of committed capital when taking with the potential promote, our economic interest is high as in our 25% equity interest.
Now let’s talk about our core businesses. New York and Washington office and retail represents 80% of our earnings in growing. Our New York Office assets totaled 19.5 million square feet substantially all in midtown. Our recent office acquisitions have been concentrated on Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue. We have a highly diversified office tenant base with over 1,200 tenants, no one tenant is more than 3.3% of the New York revenues.
Our office leasing activity in the first half of this year was a robust 987,000 square feet. We have modest lease expirations with 267,000 square feet expiring in the second half of 2012 and 760,000 square feet expiring in 2013.
We believe the office market as flows as the first half of 2011 and the financial services sector is soar. We are experiencing good growth to media, technology, education and healthcare providers.
Of our first half leasing, 22% represent the tenants expanding or new to the market place. Real growth, only 1% represent at contractions, that might be surprising to you but it’s the fact.
New York is still growing albeit at a slower pace which when coupled with very limited new supply, still our rents to continue to modestly rise. Our Manhattan Street retail leasing in the first half was also a robust 174,000 square feet. Rents to New York City Street retail are now well above their all-time highs and we continue to have great growth prospects with in place rents 30% on the market.
New York has experienced record breaking tourism with over 15 million businesses last year, a big plus for our retail assets at 2.2 million square feet before the 666 (inaudible) retail transactions. We own the largest street retail platform in New York City. Retail fee in New York are expensive and very valuable.
Let me list some of our tenants and locations. H&M at 640 Fifth Avenue, Coach at 595 Madison Avenue, Joe Fresh at 510 Fifth Avenue, TopShop and So-Ho plus our stores around Bloomingdales and in the Macy’s 10 Plaza District and up and down Fifth in Madison Avenue and at Union Square great locations, great stores.
In just a next couple of years, one of our best leases on Fifth Avenue expires releasing here to produce isle increase in rent of more than 20 million. We had this experience early this year at 689 Fifth with the rent doubled to $2,700 per foot.
As we look at New York City asset values, slow 5% cap rates may seem low, but in fact they may make imminent sense. The spread between office cap rate and U.S. treasury is historically high and absolute treasuries and borrowing cost are historically low.
The safety and resiliency of New York City continues to draw a significant investor interest in this borrowing world. Even though offer stands at still 20% below peak, asset values have recovered to near peak levels.
Turning to Washington, we are the largest office owner with a portfolio that totals almost 20 million square feet. But Washington Monica is short, but perception area is worse than reality. This is the nation’s capital, Home of the United States Government with statistically the most educated work force in the country.
Companies continue to find Washington attractive for relocation and expansion and capital continues to actively see properties in the market. We really like this market and our assets here over the long-term.
Washington today is experiencing the perfect storm, BRAC, the GSA trying to be more efficient, a presidential election and a budget stands off creating uncertainty. But we expect a moderate growth and limited supply, over the next several years we stabilize the market. We are leasing space at good rents and getting more than our fair share of the leasing activity in the market.
During the quarter we leased over 181,000 square feet space in Crystal City at initial rents of 4,230 per foot. In addition, at Harvey former space at the Warner Building, five leases have been signed totaling 170,000 square feet leaving 210,000 square feet remaining. Even at Skyline, we leased 129,000 square feet.
As we outlined in our 10-Q, of the 2.4 million square feet of the permanent defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC, today we have resolved 818,000 square feet or one third of the total including demolishing the existing 350,000 square feet at 1851 South Bell to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower, we named 1900 Crystal Drive should be delivered 2016, rising 150 feet above the current Skyline, 1900 Crystal Drive one of the heal effect on all of Crystal City.
Regarding the releasing of the DoD space, we’re ahead of where we thought we would be at this time and Joe Macnow will expand in this when he comments. We will continue to update you quarterly on our progress.
Regarding our 112 assets, 15.4 million square foot shopping center portfolio, we leased 874,000 square feet during the first half of the year. Our strip portfolio has matched us compared favorably, so the best portfolio is in this asset class. We will continue to proven this portfolio, concentrating initially on some of the incentives outside the tri-state area and make it even better.
Regarding our mall portfolio, occupancy increased at the tenants sales in the first half of 2012. Although we are not a national mall operator, our malls have very high productivity.
We recently announced a 572,000 square foot lease at the Chicago Merchandise Mart with Motorola Mobility owned by Google. Motorola Mobility is moving its corporate and headquarters to the mart, bringing with a 3,000 high-tech employees. We are delighted with this transaction, it’s a win, win, win.
The CEO of Motorola Mobility, Dennis Woodside said, “You walk into the building and there is energy”, and Rahm Emanuel the Mayor of Chicago said, “We’ve never had a place for all the intellectual capital can come.” This transaction increases the office component of the building to approximately 50% right sizing the mix of office space and shore room space. The leases is expected to commence in early 2013, the successful completion of this important lease was a joint effort between our New York and Mart leasing teams.
At the disposition of the mart properties, the mart segment is now trimmed down to 3.5 million square feet with the Merchandise Mart building in Chicago and its domestic trade show operations and the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart & Convention Center which we operate for Cuyahoga County. 7 west 34th street in New York presently in the mart segment we’ll be converted to an office building in 2014 and move to the New York segment.
In conclusion, Steve and I believe we have a great business, great assets and great people. We will continue our strategy improving and recycling assets to increase the overall quality of our portfolio. We will continue to make Vornado a similar company, most of our efforts will be directed internally capitalizing on a non-income producing assets, our redevelopment assets and our development opportunities.
Now I’d like to turn over to Joe Macnow for the financial review.

Yesterday we reported comparable funds from operations of a $1.13 per share versus a $1.15 for the prior year second quarter. Total funds from operations was $0.89 per share versus a $1.27 for the prior year second quarter. First call was at $0.95 per share and some analyst factor a non-comparable items into their estimates and others do not.
We have over $2.6 billion in liquidity and as always our investment grade balance sheet is very strong. Two measures of its trends are a 39.2% consolidated debt to enterprise value and a consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.7 times. In capital market transactions this year we’ve completed five real estate financings, aggregating $871 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.31% with a weighted average term of 6.2 years.
In April, we called and repaid $500 million of exchangeable senior debentures, in July we announced the redemption of $255 million of preferred securities with a weighted averaged dividend close to 6.9% funded by our recent issuance of $300 million of 5.7% redeemable preferred shares. These linked preferred issuances and redemptions will result in a $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost and in a $11.7 million gain in the third quarter of this year.
In addition, we still have $732 million more preferred securities which we could currently redeem with similar economics. We have virtually no debt maturing during the remainder of 2012 and we are working on 2013 debt maturities.
At today’s interest rates spreads and debt yields, the $700 million of fixed rate 2013 debt maturities with a weighted average interest rate of 6.02% represent a potential reduction of annual interest of over $14 million or $0.07 per share when they refinanced.
Our New York segment same store EBITDA was up 2.9% over the prior year’s quarter. What leased 474,000 square feet of water space at an average initial rent of $64.50 per square foot of which an 191,000 square feet with second generation at $70.39 per square foot resulting in a 7.4% GAAP mark-to-market and a 4.5% cash mark-to-market.
We leased the 140,000 square foot of retail space at an average initial rent of $68.83 per square foot resulting in a 3.7% GAAP mark-to-market and a 3.2% cash mark-to-market. This included a 93,000 square foot lease at Union Square bringing occupancy back to 100% and a 32,000 square foot lease at 1540 Broadway on the third and fourth floors giving us back 2,000 square feet of prime retail space on grade and 2,000 square feet one level above grade.
New York segment occupancy was 95.4% down 70 basis points from the first quarter as a result, the Bank of America vacating a 180,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street. New York Street retail EBITDA was $45 million compared to $47 million in the prior year’s quarter, as a result of $2.8 million of income in the prior year’s quarter from the acceleration of FAS 141 income from the termination of a lease at 1540 Broadway and the vacating of the Gap Store at 1135, 3rd avenue.
Our Washington D.C. segment same store EBITDA was down at 8.1% from the prior year’s quarter primarily due to the impact of BRAC. We leased 526,000 square feet at an average initial rent of $36.66 per square foot resulting in a 70 basis point GAAP mark-to-market and a negative 4.2% cash mark-to-market. These results include the renewal of a National Institute of Health 127,000 square foot lease in Bethesda, Maryland at $32.39 per square foot compared to $43.18 per square foot of expiring rent. Excluding this renewal, average initial rents were $38 per square foot and the GAAP and cash mark-to-markets were 7.2% and 4.1% respectively.
Mike said a Skyline we leased the 129,000 square feet. The average initial rent here was $32.20 with a 14% mark-to-market, occupancy in the total Washington segment was 85.9% down a 140 basis points from the first quarter. Based on better than projective leasing for the first six months of the year we are currently estimating that 2012 EBITDA from continuing operations for the Washington segment will be better than our previous estimate by $5 million as outlined on page 49 of the Form 10Q.
Our retail strips and mall segment team leased 384,000 square feet with mark-to-market GAAP and care spreads above 20%, almost all of which occurred in the strips. Retail segment occupancy was 93.5% up 30 basis points from the first quarter. The trend down merchandise mart EBITDA in the second quarter was $17.6 million that’s on a continuing operations basis, a $2.9 million improvement versus last year’s second quarter including a 10.5% same store increase.
At this time I’d like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

We already, I had mentioned $1 billion we’ve already achieved $821 million and I said there is another $1 billion probably to come. So we expect that with all that success with this year, we’ll certainly exceed the $1 billion we talked about, and when we look at to a full billion on 800 we’re not sure but we’ll make a bid debt will be close to $2 billion and a $1 billion.

And then with respect to the Pentagon City assets, if you think of them in two tranches, we have apartment assets totaling about 2,100 apartment opportunity unit and we are proceeding full speed ahead to get approval on about 700 units at this point in time. And once we have our final approvals in place, we are likely to move ahead and build that building as well. And then with respect to the other 10 acres, we are in the final stages of getting a master plan approved with the County of Arlington and we expect to have those approvals within the next 12 months or so and then we’ll take stock and decide when the right time would be to proceed with that project.

There is a certain group of assets like, you mentioned Eleanor, that is, when we bought Eleanor, we had 26% in it. It was adjunct to our real estate business. It quite heavy with a terrific investment exceeding well over our expectations, I think we’ve had $22 million of income in the first half of the year, which is over 30% return on investment, I think 35% to be exact.

So each of these a little different, but probably the most longer term assets to deal with are JCPenney and Toys, which I think will be on a longer term schedule.

As I think we acquired a way back when 1998, 770 Broadway which in fact we think is probably one of the best buildings in the Midtown South market place. That building is a building that has given to us and we think this one that will keep giving AOL and J. Crew were two of the major tenants in that building today, we’ve got great relationships with them. Nielsen which has a lease coming up in ’15 we think that’s a real opportunity for us, they are in the process of contributing and putting the space on the sublease market.
We’ve also in that market acquired about a year ago 1 Park Avenue and of course did a deal last year, a major lease with NYU with Langone Institute. As you look at Chicago’s Google deal obviously we’re thrilled with that lease, we have now taken the Mart building up from about 82% to a little over 95% occupancy with that deal. As Mike said, we basically have in a sense right size the showroom business taking it down to about 50% with 50% of the building being office. And most importantly that building is really becoming a tech hub building as the Mayor of Chicago even indicated, Motorola Google is joining racer fish, all scripts, 1871 which is another deal that we did with a Pittsburgh funded incubator for tech companies.
So as we look at the market, what is interesting to me is while we’ve seen relatively sluggish leasing activity certainly from the financials we realistically have continued and always will try to get ahead of the curve in terms of our leasing activity. Last year we had an enormous year of over 3 million square feet of leasing year-to-date we’ve done about a million square feet. And again as we look at our expirations over the next year, year and a half really quite modest with all of our activity as we look at all the large deals we’ve done year-to-date they’ve really been David, in every industry. They’ve been, we had a couple of deals in technology, we had a couple of financial services, insurance law, accounting fish and advertising. So we’ve seen realistically pretty good growth around the entire sector excluding financial services.

I think it’s just, it’s a little bit unfortunate that the launch of this very innovative and we think very, very exciting retail concept was a little shaky and the communication of Rahm’s pricing strategy of the customer and they are in the middle of making some very important and proper mid-course corrections right now. So we are in this investment. We have confidence in the management team. We think the idea is an exciting one. We think the investment opportunity is hugely symmetrically in the favor of reward versus the risk and we’re routing, we’re currently the biggest routers in the land on this one. So I think that the awareness things have a long haul.

So it’s something to be watchful of, I think ultimately sales volumes mean a lot and the volumes of these stores now get driven by a lots of different factors including the tourism, so suddenly keep an eye on. We obviously are thinking that we booked the low market rents, of existing market rents and hopefully any diminishing of that of volume would only effect the future rents growth, not what we have in place.
So I think it’s something that we’ll keep an eye. But we feel pretty strongly it’s got a very broad base and pretty good about the future there.

We would like to see some kind of liquidity event and so whether the pretty event is public or private is depending on what the markets are.

There is quite a few on the phone, we are happy and delighted that you all are joining us today. We’d appreciate your time and attention.
After my prepared remarks, Joe Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer will provide a financial overview and then we will answer your questions. We will end at approximately 2 p.m. It has been a very productive quarter for us and we are making significant progress on the We Will statements made in Steve’s shareholders letter.
We have had substantial progress on simplifying the company and are committed to continue this. I would like to remind everyone that 80% of our earnings come from our New York and Washington office and retails holdings where we have great platforms and great management teams.
Let’s start out by talking about asset sales. As we said in the past, we are exiting the mart business. In the second quarter we sold or contracted to sell 4 mart assets for $228 million, the L.A. Mart, the Boston Design Center, the Washington Design Center and the Canadian Trade Show Business.
As a remainder, in the first quarter we completed the sale of 350 West Mart Center for coincidently $228 million. In the second quarter we also sold our Washington Office Center which is contiguous to the Washington Design Center and 6 non-core retail properties.
The total proceeds from second quarter sales of $500 million with a net gain of $177 million. Together with sales in the first quarter, total proceeds are $821 million with a net gain of $232 million.
In the second half of the year, we are contemplating the sale of over another $1 billion of assets. Including the beginning of the mall disposition program and continuing the pruning of our strip center portfolio.
We are currently marketing Green Acres Regional Mall and Kings Plaza Regional Mall as well as our 650,000 square foot power strip center, known as the plant in San Jose, California to name a few.
Let me now talk about acquisitions. In the second quarter we focused on street retail which I would like to review. First, we contracted to buy 114,000 square foot retail condominium at 666 Fifth Avenue for $707 million at a 4.5% going in cash cap rate and a 5.6% GAAP cap rate. This deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. As you probably know, we acquired a co-controlling 49% interest in the 666 office condominium in December 2011.
Second, we announced last week that we entered into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts under which we will redevelop the retail and science departments of the New York Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel. This leads gives us effective control of the retail site that contains options based upon - based on cash flow which effects size will lead to our ownership and reward us for our redevelopment efforts.
The property is located in the bow tie in the heart of Times Square and spans the entire block from 45th Street to 46th Street on Broadway directly across our iconic 1540 Broadway retail property, formerly the home of the famous Virgin Record Store and sign.
Host Hotels & Resorts slowly transformed our property where we added Disney and Forever 21 flagship stores to create a full block front of state-of-the-art dynamic LED signage.
With a short expertise, the ironic competitive process and shows us at the Marriott Marquis site, we planned to spend as much as $140 million to redevelop and substantially expand the existing retail space including converting the below-grade parking garage into retail and creating 6-story high, 300 feet wide, block front dynamic LED signs.
666 Fifth Avenue in the Marriott Marquis Retail of the Bullseye locations in the 2 best retail areas in Manhattan, Fifth Avenue and Times Square. Both have tremendous presence in tenant demand and we are really excited about these opportunities.
Our real estate fund acquired a 167,000 square foot retail property, the western anchor of the Lincoln Road Shopping District in Miami Beach for $132 million. The Lincoln Road retail corridor in our property specifically has many of the same characteristics as our Manhattan Street retail assets.
In addition the fund acquired a 112,000 square foot office building at Saint Monica for $62 million. The fund is more than half way through investing its $800 million of committed capital when taking with the potential promote, our economic interest is higher than our 25% equity interest.
Now let’s talk about our core businesses. New York and Washington office and retail represents 80% of our earnings and growing. Our New York Office assets totaled 19.5 million square feet substantially all in Midtown. Our recent office acquisitions have been concentrated on Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue. We have a highly diversified office tenant base with over 1,200 tenants, no one tenant is more than 3.3% of the New York revenues.
Our office leasing activity in the first half of this year was a robust 987,000 square feet. We have modest lease expirations with 267,000 square feet expiring in the second half 2012 and 760,000 square feet expiring in 2013.
We believe the office market as flows as the first half of 2011 and the financial services sector is soar. We are experiencing good growth for media, technology, education and healthcare providers.
Of our first half leasing, 22% represent the tenants expanding or new to the market place. Real growth, only 1% represent a contractions, that might be surprising to you but it’s the facts.
New York is still growing albeit at a slower pace which when coupled with very limited new supply, still our rents to continue modestly rise. Our Manhattan Street retail leasing in the first half was also a robust 174,000 square feet. Rents for New York City Street retail are now well above their all-time highs and we continue to have great growth prospects with in place rents 30% on the market.
New York has experienced record breaking tourism with over 15 million businesses last year, a big plus for our retail assets at 2.2 million square feet before the 666 and Marriott retail transactions. We own the largest street retail platform in New York City. Retail fee in New York are expensive and very valuable.
Let me list some of our tenants and locations. H&M at 640 Fifth Avenue, Coach at 595 Madison Avenue, Joe Fresh at 510 Fifth Avenue, TopShop and So-Ho plus our stores around Bloomingdales and in the Macy’s 10 Plaza District and up and down Fifth and Madison Avenues and at Union Square great locations, great stores.
In just a next couple of years, one of our best leases on Fifth Avenue expires releasing here to produce an increase in rent of more than 20 million. We had this experience early this year at 689 Fifth where the rent doubled to $2,700 per foot.
As we look at New York City asset values, slow 5% cap rates may seem low, but in fact they may make imminent sense. The spread between office cap rate and U.S. treasury is historically high and absolute treasuries and borrowing costs are historically low.
The safety and resiliency of New York City continues to draw a significant investor interest in this borrowing world. Even though offer stands at still 20% below peak, asset values have recovered to near peak levels.
Turning to Washington, we are the largest office owner with a portfolio that totals almost 20 million square feet. But Washington market is short, but perception area is worse than reality. This is the nation’s capital, Home of the United States Government with statistically the most educated work force in the country.
Companies continue to find Washington attractive for relocation and expansion and the capital continues to actively see properties in the market. We really like this market and our assets here over the long-term.
Washington today is experiencing the perfect storm, BRAC, the GSA trying to be more efficient, a presidential election and a budget standoff creating uncertainty. But we expect a moderate growth and limited supply, over the next several years we stabilize the market. We are leasing space at good rents and getting more than our fair share of the leasing activity in the market.
During the quarter we leased over 181,000 square feet space in Crystal City at initial rents of 4,230 per foot. In addition, at Harvey former space at the Warner Building, 5 leases have been signed totaling 170,000 square feet leaving 210,000 square feet remaining. Even at Skyline, we leased 129,000 square feet.
As we outlined in our 10-Q, of the 2.4 million square feet of the permanent defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC, today we have resolved 818,000 square feet or one third of the total including demolishing the existing 350,000 square feet at 1851 South Bell to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower, we named 1900 Crystal Drive should be delivered 2016, rising 150 feet above the current Skyline, 1900 Crystal Drive will have a halo effect on all of Crystal City.
Regarding the releasing of the DoD space, we’re ahead of where we thought we would be at this time and Joe Macnow will expand in this when he comments. We will continue to update you quarterly on our progress.
Regarding our 112 assets, 15.4 million square foot shopping center portfolio, we leased 874,000 square feet during the first half of the year. Our strip portfolio has matched us compared favorably, so the best portfolio is in this asset class. We will continue to prune this portfolio, concentrating initially on some of the incentives outside the tri-state area and make it even better.
Regarding our mall portfolio, occupancy increased as did tenants sales in the first half of 2012. Although we are not a national mall operator, our malls have very high productivity.
We recently announced a 572,000 square foot lease at the Chicago Merchandise Mart with Motorola Mobility owned by Google. Motorola Mobility is moving its corporate and world headquarters to the mart, bringing with a 3,000 high-tech employees. We are delighted with this transaction, it’s a win, win, win.
The CEO of Motorola Mobility, Dennis Woodside said, “You walk into that building and there is energy”, and Rahm Emanuel the Mayor of Chicago said, “We’ve never had a place where all the intellectual capital can come.” This transaction increases the office component of the building to approximately 50% right sizing the mix of office space and share room space. The leases is expected to commence in early 2013, the successful completion of this important lease was a joint effort between our New York and Mart leasing teams.
After the disposition of the mart properties, the mart segment is now trimmed down to 3.5 million square feet with the Merchandise Mart building in Chicago and its domestic trade show operations and the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart & Convention Center which we operate for Cuyahoga County. 7 west 34th street in New York presently in the mart segment will be converted to an office building in 2014 and move to the New York segment.
In conclusion, Steve and I believe we have a great business, great assets and great people. We will continue our strategy of pruning and recycling assets to increase the overall quality of our portfolio. We will continue to make Vornado a similar company, most of our efforts will be directed internally capitalizing on our non-income producing assets, our redevelopment assets and our development opportunities.
Now I’d like to turn over to Joe Macnow for the financial review."

Yesterday we reported comparable funds from operations of a $1.13 per share versus $1.15 for the prior year second quarter. Total funds from operations was $0.89 per share versus $1.27 for the prior year second quarter. First call was at $0.95 per share and some analysts factor in non-comparable items into their estimates and others do not.
We have over $2.6 billion in liquidity and as always our investment grade balance sheet is very strong. Two measures of its trend are a 39.2% consolidated debt to enterprise value and a consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.7x. In capital market transactions this year we’ve completed 5 real estate financings, aggregating $871 million and a weighted average interest rate of 3.31% with a weighted average term of 6.2 years.
In April, we called and repaid $500 million of exchangeable senior debentures, in July we announced the redemption of $255 million of preferred securities with a weighted averaged dividend course to 6.9% funded by our recent issuance of $300 million of 5.7% redeemable preferred shares. These linked preferred issuances and redemptions will result in a $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost and in an $11.7 million gain in the third quarter of this year.
In addition, we still have $732 million more preferred securities which we could currently redeem with similar economics. We have virtually no debt maturing during the remainder of 2012 and we are working on 2013 debt maturities.
At today’s interest rates spreads and debt yields, the $700 million of fixed rate 2013 debt maturities with a weighted average interest rate of 6.02% represent a potential reduction of annual interest of over $14 million or $0.07 per share when they’re refinanced.
Our New York segment same store EBITDA was up 2.9% over the prior year’s quarter. We leased 474,000 square feet of office space at an average initial rent of $64.50 per square foot of which 191,000 square feet was second generation at $70.39 per square foot resulting in a 7.4% GAAP mark-to-market and a 4.5% cash mark-to-market.
We leased the 140,000 square foot of retail space at an average initial rent of $68.83 per square foot resulting in a 3.7% GAAP mark-to-market and a 3.2% cash mark-to-market. This included a 93,000 square foot lease at Union Square bringing occupancy back to 100% and a 32,000 square foot lease at 1540 Broadway on the third and fourth floors giving us back 2,000 square feet of prime retail space on grade and 2,000 square feet one level above grade.
New York segment occupancy was 95.4% down 70 basis points from the first quarter as a result, the Bank of America vacating 180,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street. New York Street retail EBITDA was $45 million compared to $47 million in the prior year’s quarter, as a result of $2.8 million of income in the prior year’s quarter from the acceleration of FAS 141 income from the termination of a lease at 1540 Broadway and the vacating of the Gap Store at 1135 3rd Avenue.
Our Washington D.C. segment same store EBITDA was down at 8.1% from the prior year’s quarter primarily due to the impact of BRAC. We leased 526,000 square feet at an average initial rent of $36.66 per square foot resulting in a 70 basis point GAAP mark-to-market and a negative 4.2% cash mark-to-market. These results include the renewal of a National Institute of Health 127,000 square foot lease in Bethesda, Maryland at $32.39 per square foot compared to $43.18 per square foot of expiring rent. Excluding this renewal, average initial rents were $38 per square foot and the GAAP and cash mark-to-markets were 7.2% and 4.1%, respectively.
Mike said the Skyline we leased the 129,000 square feet. The average initial rent here was $32.20 with a 14% mark-to-market, occupancy in the total Washington segment was 85.9% down a 140 basis points from the first quarter. Based on better than projective leasing for the first 6 months of the year we are currently estimating that 2012 EBITDA from continuing operations for the Washington segment will be better than our previous estimate by $5 million as outlined on Page 49 of the Form 10Q.
Our retail strips and mall segment team leased 384,000 square feet with mark-to-market GAAP and care spreads above 20%, almost all of which occurred in the strips. Retail segment occupancy was 93.5% up 30 basis points from the first quarter. The trend down merchandise mart EBITDA in the second quarter was $17.6 million that’s on a continuing operations basis, a $2.9 million improvement versus last year’s second quarter including a 10.5% same store increase.

As far as other, there was only a few of the things up for sale, also looking at the other strip centers and some more assets that we look to dispose of.
We already, I had mentioned $1 billion we’ve already achieved $821 million of the $1 billion, and I said there is another $1 billion probably to come. So we expect that if all that is successful this year, then we’ll certainly exceed the $1 billion we talked about, and when we get to a full billion after we add that $800 million we’re not sure but we’ll make a big dent we’ll be close to $2 billion and a $1 billion."

We think there is some real upside in this building going forward. The rents in the building today are somewhere in the mid-50s and as Mike says, it’s a building candidly that I’m proud to be a caretaker of."

As I think you know, we acquired a way back when 1998, 770 Broadway which in fact we think is probably one of the best buildings in the Midtown South marketplace. That building is a building that has given to us and we think this one that will keep giving AOL and J. Crew were 2 of the major tenants in that building today, we’ve got great relationships with them. Nielsen which has a lease coming up in ’15 we think that’s a real opportunity for us; they are in the process of contributing and putting the space on the sublease market.
We’ve also in that market acquired about a year ago 1 Park Avenue and of course did a deal last year, a major lease with NYU the Langone Institute. As you look at Chicago’s Google deal obviously we’re thrilled with that lease, we have now taken the Mart building up from about 82% to a little over 95% occupancy with that deal. As Mike said, we basically have in a sense right sized the showroom business taking it down to about 50% with 50% of the building being office. And most importantly that building is really becoming a tech hub building as the Mayor of Chicago even indicated, Motorola Google is joining Razor Fish, All Scripts, 1871 which is another deal that we did with a Pittsburgh funded incubator for tech companies.
So as we look at the market, what is interesting to me is while we’ve seen relatively sluggish leasing activity certainly from the financials we realistically have continued and always will try to get ahead of the curve in terms of our leasing activity. Last year we had an enormous year of over 3 million square feet of leasing year-to-date we’ve done about a million square feet. And again as we look at our expirations over the next year, 1.5 years really quite modest with all of our activity as we look at all the large deals we’ve done year-to-date they’ve really been David, in every industry. They’ve been, we had a couple of deals in technology, we had a couple of financial services, insurance law, accounting, fish and advertising. So we’ve seen realistically pretty good growth around the entire sector excluding financial services."

So having said that, we’ve done retail investments of this nature a dozen times before over the last large number of years quite successfully by the way.
The JCPenney investment is an investment that we’re committed to; we have an enormous amount of a competence in Rahm, Johnson and his team. Rahm is not bashful in explaining to the public and the investing public as ideas, if you go on to the JCPenney website all of his presentations are on their website and all of his strategy is there, very quite graphically and very understandably.
I think it’s just, it’s a little bit unfortunate that the launch of this very innovative and we think very, very exciting retail concept was a little shaky in the communication of Rahm’s pricing strategy to the customer and they are in the middle of making some very important and proper mid-course corrections right now. So we are in this investment. We have confidence in the management team. We think the idea is an exciting one. We think the investment opportunity is hugely symmetrically in the favor of reward versus the risk and we’re rooting, we’re currently the biggest rooters in the land on this one. So I think that the awareness things have a long haul."

There is quite a few on the phone, we are happy and delighted that you all are joining us today. We’d appreciate your time and attention.
After my prepared remarks, Joe Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer will provide a financial overview and then we will answer your questions. We will end at approximately 2 p.m. It has been a very productive quarter for us and we are making significant progress on the We Will statements made in Steve’s shareholders letter.
We have had substantial progress on simplifying the company and are committed to continue this. I would like to remind everyone that 80% of our earnings come from our New York and Washington office and retails holdings where we have great platforms and great management teams.
Let’s start out by talking about asset sales. As we said in the past, we are exiting the mart business. In the second quarter we sold or contracted to sell 4 mart assets for $228 million, the L.A. Mart, the Boston Design Center, the Washington Design Center and the Canadian Trade Show Business.
As a remainder, in the first quarter we completed the sale of 350 West Mart Center for coincidently $228 million. In the second quarter we also sold our Washington Office Center which is contiguous to the Washington Design Center and 6 non-core retail properties.
The total proceeds from second quarter sales of $500 million with a net gain of $177 million. Together with sales in the first quarter, total proceeds are $821 million with a net gain of $232 million.
In the second half of the year, we are contemplating the sale of over another $1 billion of assets. Including the beginning of the mall disposition program and continuing the pruning of our strip center portfolio.
We are currently marketing Green Acres Regional Mall and Kings Plaza Regional Mall as well as our 650,000 square foot power strip center, known as the plant in San Jose, California to name a few.
Let me now talk about acquisitions. In the second quarter we focused on street retail which I would like to review. First, we contracted to buy 114,000 square foot retail condominium at 666 Fifth Avenue for $707 million at a 4.5% going in cash cap rate and a 5.6% GAAP cap rate. This deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. As you probably know, we acquired a co-controlling 49% interest in the 666 office condominium in December 2011.
Second, we announced last week that we entered into a lease with Host Hotels & Resorts under which we will redevelop the retail and science departments of the New York Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel. This leads gives us effective control of the retail site that contains options based upon - based on cash flow which effects size will lead to our ownership and reward us for our redevelopment efforts.
The property is located in the bow tie in the heart of Times Square and spans the entire block from 45th Street to 46th Street on Broadway directly across our iconic 1540 Broadway retail property, formerly the home of the famous Virgin Record Store and sign.
Host Hotels & Resorts slowly transformed our property where we added Disney and Forever 21 flagship stores to create a full block front of state-of-the-art dynamic LED signage.
With a short expertise, the ironic competitive process and shows us at the Marriott Marquis site, we planned to spend as much as $140 million to redevelop and substantially expand the existing retail space including converting the below-grade parking garage into retail and creating 6-story high, 300 feet wide, block front dynamic LED signs.
666 Fifth Avenue in the Marriott Marquis Retail of the Bullseye locations in the 2 best retail areas in Manhattan, Fifth Avenue and Times Square. Both have tremendous presence in tenant demand and we are really excited about these opportunities.
Our real estate fund acquired a 167,000 square foot retail property, the western anchor of the Lincoln Road Shopping District in Miami Beach for $132 million. The Lincoln Road retail corridor in our property specifically has many of the same characteristics as our Manhattan Street retail assets.
In addition the fund acquired a 112,000 square foot office building at Saint Monica for $62 million. The fund is more than half way through investing its $800 million of committed capital when taking with the potential promote, our economic interest is higher than our 25% equity interest.
Now let’s talk about our core businesses. New York and Washington office and retail represents 80% of our earnings and growing. Our New York Office assets totaled 19.5 million square feet substantially all in Midtown. Our recent office acquisitions have been concentrated on Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue. We have a highly diversified office tenant base with over 1,200 tenants, no one tenant is more than 3.3% of the New York revenues.
Our office leasing activity in the first half of this year was a robust 987,000 square feet. We have modest lease expirations with 267,000 square feet expiring in the second half 2012 and 760,000 square feet expiring in 2013.
We believe the office market as flows as the first half of 2011 and the financial services sector is soar. We are experiencing good growth for media, technology, education and healthcare providers.
Of our first half leasing, 22% represent the tenants expanding or new to the market place. Real growth, only 1% represent a contractions, that might be surprising to you but it’s the facts.
New York is still growing albeit at a slower pace which when coupled with very limited new supply, still our rents to continue modestly rise. Our Manhattan Street retail leasing in the first half was also a robust 174,000 square feet. Rents for New York City Street retail are now well above their all-time highs and we continue to have great growth prospects with in place rents 30% on the market.
New York has experienced record breaking tourism with over 15 million businesses last year, a big plus for our retail assets at 2.2 million square feet before the 666 and Marriott retail transactions. We own the largest street retail platform in New York City. Retail fee in New York are expensive and very valuable.
Let me list some of our tenants and locations. H&M at 640 Fifth Avenue, Coach at 595 Madison Avenue, Joe Fresh at 510 Fifth Avenue, TopShop and So-Ho plus our stores around Bloomingdales and in the Macy’s 10 Plaza District and up and down Fifth and Madison Avenues and at Union Square great locations, great stores.
In just a next couple of years, one of our best leases on Fifth Avenue expires releasing here to produce an increase in rent of more than 20 million. We had this experience early this year at 689 Fifth where the rent doubled to $2,700 per foot.
As we look at New York City asset values, slow 5% cap rates may seem low, but in fact they may make imminent sense. The spread between office cap rate and U.S. treasury is historically high and absolute treasuries and borrowing costs are historically low.
The safety and resiliency of New York City continues to draw a significant investor interest in this borrowing world. Even though offer stands at still 20% below peak, asset values have recovered to near peak levels.
Turning to Washington, we are the largest office owner with a portfolio that totals almost 20 million square feet. But Washington market is short, but perception area is worse than reality. This is the nation’s capital, Home of the United States Government with statistically the most educated work force in the country.
Companies continue to find Washington attractive for relocation and expansion and the capital continues to actively see properties in the market. We really like this market and our assets here over the long-term.
Washington today is experiencing the perfect storm, BRAC, the GSA trying to be more efficient, a presidential election and a budget standoff creating uncertainty. But we expect a moderate growth and limited supply, over the next several years we stabilize the market. We are leasing space at good rents and getting more than our fair share of the leasing activity in the market.
During the quarter we leased over 181,000 square feet space in Crystal City at initial rents of 4,230 per foot. In addition, at Harvey former space at the Warner Building, 5 leases have been signed totaling 170,000 square feet leaving 210,000 square feet remaining. Even at Skyline, we leased 129,000 square feet.
As we outlined in our 10-Q, of the 2.4 million square feet of the permanent defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC, today we have resolved 818,000 square feet or one third of the total including demolishing the existing 350,000 square feet at 1851 South Bell to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower, we named 1900 Crystal Drive should be delivered 2016, rising 150 feet above the current Skyline, 1900 Crystal Drive will have a halo effect on all of Crystal City.
Regarding the releasing of the DoD space, we’re ahead of where we thought we would be at this time and Joe Macnow will expand in this when he comments. We will continue to update you quarterly on our progress.
Regarding our 112 assets, 15.4 million square foot shopping center portfolio, we leased 874,000 square feet during the first half of the year. Our strip portfolio has matched us compared favorably, so the best portfolio is in this asset class. We will continue to prune this portfolio, concentrating initially on some of the incentives outside the tri-state area and make it even better.
Regarding our mall portfolio, occupancy increased as did tenants sales in the first half of 2012. Although we are not a national mall operator, our malls have very high productivity.
We recently announced a 572,000 square foot lease at the Chicago Merchandise Mart with Motorola Mobility owned by Google. Motorola Mobility is moving its corporate and world headquarters to the mart, bringing with a 3,000 high-tech employees. We are delighted with this transaction, it’s a win, win, win.
The CEO of Motorola Mobility, Dennis Woodside said, “You walk into that building and there is energy”, and Rahm Emanuel the Mayor of Chicago said, “We’ve never had a place where all the intellectual capital can come.” This transaction increases the office component of the building to approximately 50% right sizing the mix of office space and share room space. The leases is expected to commence in early 2013, the successful completion of this important lease was a joint effort between our New York and Mart leasing teams.
After the disposition of the mart properties, the mart segment is now trimmed down to 3.5 million square feet with the Merchandise Mart building in Chicago and its domestic trade show operations and the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart & Convention Center which we operate for Cuyahoga County. 7 west 34th street in New York presently in the mart segment will be converted to an office building in 2014 and move to the New York segment.
In conclusion, Steve and I believe we have a great business, great assets and great people. We will continue our strategy of pruning and recycling assets to increase the overall quality of our portfolio. We will continue to make Vornado a similar company, most of our efforts will be directed internally capitalizing on our non-income producing assets, our redevelopment assets and our development opportunities.
Now I’d like to turn over to Joe Macnow for the financial review."

First call was at $0.95 per share and some analysts factor in non-comparable items into their estimates and others do not.
We have over $2.6 billion in liquidity and as always our investment grade balance sheet is very strong. Two measures of its trend are a 39.2% consolidated debt to enterprise value and a consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.7x. In capital market transactions this year we’ve completed 5 real estate financings, aggregating $871 million and a weighted average interest rate of 3.31% with a weighted average term of 6.2 years.
In April, we called and repaid $500 million of exchangeable senior debentures, in July we announced the redemption of $255 million of preferred securities with a weighted averaged dividend course to 6.9% funded by our recent issuance of $300 million of 5.7% redeemable preferred shares. These linked preferred issuances and redemptions will result in a $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost and in an $11.7 million gain in the third quarter of this year.
In addition, we still have $732 million more preferred securities which we could currently redeem with similar economics. We have virtually no debt maturing during the remainder of 2012 and we are working on 2013 debt maturities.
At today’s interest rates spreads and debt yields, the $700 million of fixed rate 2013 debt maturities with a weighted average interest rate of 6.02% represent a potential reduction of annual interest of over $14 million or $0.07 per share when they’re refinanced.
Our New York segment same store EBITDA was up 2.9% over the prior year’s quarter. We leased 474,000 square feet of office space at an average initial rent of $64.50 per square foot of which 191,000 square feet was second generation at $70.39 per square foot resulting in a 7.4% GAAP mark-to-market and a 4.5% cash mark-to-market.
We leased the 140,000 square foot of retail space at an average initial rent of $68.83 per square foot resulting in a 3.7% GAAP mark-to-market and a 3.2% cash mark-to-market. This included a 93,000 square foot lease at Union Square bringing occupancy back to 100% and a 32,000 square foot lease at 1540 Broadway on the third and fourth floors giving us back 2,000 square feet of prime retail space on grade and 2,000 square feet one level above grade.
New York segment occupancy was 95.4% down 70 basis points from the first quarter as a result, the Bank of America vacating 180,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street. New York Street retail EBITDA was $45 million compared to $47 million in the prior year’s quarter, as a result of $2.8 million of income in the prior year’s quarter from the acceleration of FAS 141 income from the termination of a lease at 1540 Broadway and the vacating of the Gap Store at 1135 3rd Avenue.
Our Washington D.C. segment same store EBITDA was down at 8.1% from the prior year’s quarter primarily due to the impact of BRAC. We leased 526,000 square feet at an average initial rent of $36.66 per square foot resulting in a 70 basis point GAAP mark-to-market and a negative 4.2% cash mark-to-market. These results include the renewal of a National Institute of Health 127,000 square foot lease in Bethesda, Maryland at $32.39 per square foot compared to $43.18 per square foot of expiring rent. Excluding this renewal, average initial rents were $38 per square foot and the GAAP and cash mark-to-markets were 7.2% and 4.1%, respectively.
Mike said the Skyline we leased the 129,000 square feet. The average initial rent here was $32.20 with a 14% mark-to-market, occupancy in the total Washington segment was 85.9% down a 140 basis points from the first quarter. Based on better than projective leasing for the first 6 months of the year we are currently estimating that 2012 EBITDA from continuing operations for the Washington segment will be better than our previous estimate by $5 million as outlined on Page 49 of the Form 10Q.
Our retail strips and mall segment team leased 384,000 square feet with mark-to-market GAAP and care spreads above 20%, almost all of which occurred in the strips. Retail segment occupancy was 93.5% up 30 basis points from the first quarter. The trend down merchandise mart EBITDA in the second quarter was $17.6 million that’s on a continuing operations basis, a $2.9 million improvement versus last year’s second quarter including a 10.5% same store increase.
At this time I’d like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

We already, I had mentioned $1 billion we’ve already achieved $821 million of the $1 billion, and I said there is another $1 billion probably to come. So we expect that if all that is successful this year, then we’ll certainly exceed the $1 billion we talked about, and when we get to a full billion after we add that $800 million we’re not sure but we’ll make a big dent we’ll be close to $2 billion and a $1 billion."

As I think you know, we acquired a way back when 1998, 770 Broadway which in fact we think is probably one of the best buildings in the Midtown South marketplace. That building is a building that has given to us and we think this one that will keep giving AOL and J. Crew were 2 of the major tenants in that building today, we’ve got great relationships with them. Nielsen which has a lease coming up in ’15 we think that’s a real opportunity for us; they are in the process of contributing and putting the space on the sublease market.
We’ve also in that market acquired about a year ago 1 Park Avenue and of course did a deal last year, a major lease with NYU the Langone Institute. As you look at Chicago’s Google deal obviously we’re thrilled with that lease, we have now taken the Mart building up from about 82% to a little over 95% occupancy with that deal. As Mike said, we basically have in a sense right sized the showroom business taking it down to about 50% with 50% of the building being office. And most importantly that building is really becoming a tech hub building as the Mayor of Chicago even indicated, Motorola Google is joining Razor Fish, All Scripts, 1871 which is another deal that we did with a Pittsburgh funded incubator for tech companies.
So as we look at the market, what is interesting to me is while we’ve seen relatively sluggish leasing activity certainly from the financials we realistically have continued and always will try to get ahead of the curve in terms of our leasing activity. Last year we had an enormous year of over 3 million square feet of leasing year-to-date we’ve done about a million square feet. And again as we look at our expirations over the next year, 1.5 years really quite modest with all of our activity as we look at all the large deals we’ve done year-to-date they’ve really been David, in every industry. They’ve been, we had a couple of deals in technology, we had a couple of financial services, insurance law, accounting, fish and advertising. So we’ve seen realistically pretty good growth around the entire sector excluding financial services."

So having said that, we’ve done retail investments of this nature a dozen times before over the last large number of years quite successfully by the way.
The JCPenney investment is an investment that we’re committed to; we have an enormous amount of a competence in Rahm, Johnson and his team. Rahm is not bashful in explaining to the public and the investing public as ideas, if you go on to the JCPenney website all of his presentations are on their website and all of his strategy is there, very quite graphically and very understandably.
I think it’s just, it’s a little bit unfortunate that the launch of this very innovative and we think very, very exciting retail concept was a little shaky in the communication of Rahm’s pricing strategy to the customer and they are in the middle of making some very important and proper mid-course corrections right now. So we are in this investment. We have confidence in the management team. We think the idea is an exciting one. We think the investment opportunity is hugely symmetrically in the favor of reward versus the risk and we’re rooting, we’re currently the biggest rooters in the land on this one. So I think that the awareness things have a long haul."

We'll end at 11:00.
Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge the devastation the Northeast suffered from Hurricane Sandy. This tragedy, which cost over 100 lives thus far, and tens of billions of property damage, affected our home bases in New York and Washington, particularly New York, which was hardest. 
I'm pleased to report that we suffered no personal injuries and only minor property damage. I want to thank all of our people for the incredible job they did and express our best wishes to all those affected by the hurricane as they recover. 
David and Mitchell will comment further, particularly David, on the the specifics for their businesses. 
Overall, I'm quite satisfied with our third quarter results, which were better than last year's third quarter. In spite of the downward pressure coming from Washington D.C. and no story. It's interesting to note that if Washington would have been leveled this year to last, we would have had comparable FFO performance over the prior year's quarter of 7%. 
The Washington office market is sluggish, and the New York office market lacking support from the financial service industry is locked in neutral. However, it is clear from our financial results that our New York portfolio is outperforming the market, and our Washington portfolio is outperforming the projections we provided in our public filings. David and Mitchell will expand on this in a few minutes. Let me update you on asset sales. Part of our program to simplify and to recycle capital into our core portfolio, high-quality office and retail assets. 
In the third quarter, we closed on the previously announced sales of the Washington Design Center, Washington Office Center, the Canadian Tradeshow Business in Dorchester, a non-core strip shopping centers. Total proceeds from these sales were $323 million, with a  third quarter net gain of $149 million. 
Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of 2 mall for $1.25 million, the Green acres Mall and Alexander's King Plaza Mall, which were both sold to the Macy's company. When completed, these transactions will produce substantial proceeds and gains, and Joe will provide further detail in a few minutes on the specifics of these gains and distributions. 
We also announced the sale of a 3-building suburban office complex in Fairfax County, Virginia for $126 million, resulting in a net gain of $35 million. We sold the building on Marcus Street in Philadelphia, which is part of the gallery for $60 million, resulting in a gain of $35 million. We expect to close both these deals in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, we expect to close the fourth quarter with the previously announced sale of the Boston Design Center, which is approximately $72 million. 
Lastly, we sold our equity investment to Brookfield Asset Management for $28 million. We will continue to hold $25 million of 4.75% 2018 debentures. 
In summary, this year, we produced $2.3 billion of assets sales with a net gain of $674 million and expect to pay at least a special long-term capital gains dividend of $202 million or $1.02 per share for a share of Kings Plaza. 
We intend to do a tax-deferred lifetime exchange with the sale proceeds of Greenacres and others. We will continue to dispose of noncore assets. We just acquired a 25% participation in a $475 million first mortgage and mezzanine loans on 7107 Avenue, a retail redevelopment property in Times Square, where we already have 2 properties in that market. 
The yield today is 11%, which will increase our senior position. We will continue to invest in our existing assets and development opportunities. Given the current environment, our strategy for acquisition will be measured and focused on continuing to expand our leading New York City street retail platform and upgrading our high-quality office property platform. 
Let me now turn the call over to David to discuss the New York business."

Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we've been going through here in New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all occurrences, and last Friday, as we began to receive dire warnings, we implemented our emergency management procedures, coordinating all of our personnel to have round-the-clock coverage in all of our buildings. Our engineers, quarters, security guards and property management professionals all hunkered down during the storm. Some of them still today in buildings, which are dark, literally living in the buildings, sleeping and shifts on cots. I'm enormously proud of our team for securing all of our buildings during the storm and for communicating on a realtime basis updates to all of our tenants. Most of our buildings did not lose power and have remained throughout. Other than 1 small building directly in 1 of the flood zones downtown, which will take about a week to bring, all of the buildings that lost power should be up and running as soon as completes the repairs to its network, which we hope will take place this weekend.
Now let me turn to the quarter. While the overall market in New York is tepid, we've had a strong quarter. We released over 500,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, which took our office occupancy up 50 basis points to 95.8%. 
The highlights of our leasing activity this quarter are 2 headquarters consolidation deals, 1 in financial services and 1 in advertising. 
At 350 Park, we leased 103,000 square feet to M&T Bank in a renewal and expansion transaction, which allowed M&T to consolidate its Wilmington Trust Division, which they'd recently acquired into 350 Park Avenue. To produce the expansion space in this complicated deal, we terminated 2 leases early and also renegotiated 2 other leases. 
At 909 3rd Avenue, we leased 220,000 square feet to IPG, the Interpublic Group, which allowed IPG to consolidate offices from 4 different locations into our building. For IPG, we created a headquarters environment, including dedicated lobby space and elevators, branding and a great outdoor terrace space. 
To make this deal, we leveraged our existing relationship with IPG, which is also our lead tenant at 100 West 33rd Street, where IPG occupies over 400,000 square feet. 
These 2 large transactions, plus another 22 leases signed in the quarter, had an average starting rent of $58.74 per square foot, with a positive mark-to-market of 8.9% cash and 5% GAAP. 
Many of the flash analyst reports, which I read last night, commented on our CapEx. Our average GIs were elevated this quarter at $56.92 per square foot. That's because 75% of this quarter's leasing activity was new and expansion deals versus 30%, which was the case in the first half of the year. 
Our year-to-date office leasing activity is a robust 1.5 million square feet, which includes some 620,000 square feet of leasing and our 10 Plaza office portfolio. The Midtown South submarket with its type availabilities has been expanding to include 10 Plaza. In fact, 10 Plaza recently was reported to have the lowest Class A vacancy rate in Midtown at sub 5%. This has allowed us to begin to push Pent Plaza and at 1 Penn Plaza, we recently have completed several deals over $60 per square foot. 
For our entire 19.6 million square foot office portfolio, we have a relatively modest amount of upcoming lease expirations with 156,000 square feet expiring in the balance of this year and 673,000 square feet expiring in '13. This amount of upcoming expirations has been substantially reduced as a result of our aggressive forward leasing over the last several quarters. 
Let me now spend a minute talking about some market dynamics. Since last summer, the market effectively has been at equilibrium with the Manhattan vacancy rate hovering just under 10%. Our occupancy at 95.8% continues to outperform the market as we do quarter in and quarter out. Renewals this year have made the bulk of the transactions in the market enabling tenants to avoid capital expenditures. In fact, in Midtown there have only been 3 major relocation deals year-to-date over 100,000 square feet, the IPG lease I mentioned earlier is one of those 3 deals. Uncertainty in the regulatory environment has also led the financial institutions to remain on the sidelines. However, our diversified portfolio of over 1,200 tenants is not reliant on any 1 industry. Take a look at the list of the major tenants in our New York segment property table in the financial supplement and you'll see what I mean.
In years past, view space in the tower of the building was the first ago. With affordability being the theme of today, that trend seems to have reversed somewhat as tenants are focusing on the base of buildings both for the value prospect and the flexibility larger floor plates provide for open space planning. This bodes well for the releasing of the former Citibank space at 666 Fifth Avenue. While you likely have read that Citi has moved out of the space, we will continue to receive rent through the lease expiration 2 years hence, giving us considerable time to release the space. 
Regarding trophy space, which includes our buildings at 645th Avenue, 8887 Avenue, 280 Park Avenue and 350 Park Avenue, while the market is not yet back to the premium seen before the financial crisis, there have been 27 transaction over $100 per square foot year-to-date. I'm pleased to say that 3 of those $100-plus deals have been in our own portfolio and we have 2 more in the hopper. 
We have a long track record of transforming buildings to create value, having done it time and again, 770 Broadway, 1740 Broadway 645 Avenue and 8887 Avenue just to name a few. Earlier this year, we completed the total redevelopment of our 330 Madison property, capped by over 400,000 square feet of leasing activity, including headquarters transactions with Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle. 
At 280 Park Avenue, the transformation is now underway with our joint venture partner, SL Green. Designed by, Cohen Patterson Fox, the building will feature a new double height lobby spanning the entire Park Avenue block front and a Winter Garden interconnecting both building surrounded by new plazas. The receptivity to the overall redevelopment plan from the brokerage and tenant communities have been very positive, and while we are fielding lease increase, our experience in the many buildings we have redeveloped is that while the renderings are great, what the tenant community and brokers really appreciate is the quality of the redevelopment when they start to see it completed. 
We have 1 other major transformation well underway at 1290 Avenue of the Americas where we are dramatically upgrading the scaling character of the lobby, storefront and elevators to match the stature of this 2 plus million square foot corporate headquarters building. This project is currently under construction with completion scheduled in the first quarter of 2013. The change already is dramatic. I'd encourage you to go take a look. 
Turning now to our Manhattan street retail portfolio where we own the dominant 2.3 million-square-foot retail platform. We lease 180,000 square feet of retail space year-to-date with positive mark-to-market of 19.4% cash and 27.2% GAAP. 
The retail market is very strong, driven by the continued growth in tourism, which is expected to reach 52 million visitors this year. New York continues to be the gateway market for global retailers including, for example, Massimo Dutti, one of Zara's brands, which opened its first store in the United States at our 689 Fifth Avenue property last month. Retail rents are now well above their all-time highs, approaching $3,000 per square foot on 5th Avenue and $2,000 per square foot in Times Square. 
In Times Square, last week, Microsoft opened a pop-up stores at our 1540 Broadway property for the global launch of its new surface tablet computers. Sales here have exceeded Microsoft's expectations, which again demonstrates the strength of the Times Square market, both Massimo Dutti and Microsoft deals speak to the exceptional quality of our Manhattan street retail portfolio. We continue to have great growth prospects in this portfolio of extremely well-located assets with in-place rents averaging 30% under market and by the way many individual assets are multiples of that. We couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the development of the full block front of retail signage at Marriott Marquis, which is directly across from 1540 Broadway, the 2 best sites by far in Times Square. 
For the entire year New York division, which is a total of 25.5 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 0.7% cash and 0.3% GAAP. If you exclude the Hotel Penn, which was weak this quarter, along with the rest of the New York hotel market, the same-store increase is positive 1.9% cash and 1.3% GAAP. Now let me turn it back over to Mike."

While we in Washington largely dodged Sandy, I have an incredibly competent team on the ground that was fully prepared for the worst. Our colleagues in New York before the brunt of it and really did job during this crisis. As you may know, our Washington portfolio is approximately 20 million square feet, concentrated in Washington D.C. and Arlington, Virginia directly across the Potomac River in Crystal City, Pentagon City and Roslyn. Our footprint is about twice the size of any of our peers. 
I want to start by contextualizing the Washington Metro market in general. Currently, market demand is soft but not as soft as many believe. Our tenants await the election results and clarity on the budget crisis. There is leasing activity in the market. In 2012, the gross leasing activity is expected to be about 32 million square feet, which is actually on par with the 15-year average. There is a lot of churn but not yet enough absorption to eat into vacancies, especially in this peak year. Through 3 quarters of this year, there was negative absorption of about 2.5 million square feet in the market. Rents are holding steady but concessions are up to attract tenants. Limited supply over the next several years will help to stabilize the market, but we don't really expect the market to gain significant traction until 2014. 
Within our Washington portfolio, our year-to-date leasing velocity has been brisk. Over 1.6 million square feet so far, well ahead of our projection for the full year. We are attracting good activity and consistently executing more than our fair share of deals at good risks. 
In fact, we had signed 6 new leases each, one of them over 50,000 square feet as compared to 1 new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011. In the third quarter specifically, we leased 435,000 square feet at very good average initial rents of $44.02 per square foot, and this is versus 389,000 square feet leased in the same quarter last year. The GAAP mark-to-market was 13.8%, and the cash mark-to-market was 8.9%. Of the total 435,000 square feet pleased this quarter, government leases accounted for 170,000 square feet and the private sector leased 265,000 square feet. So despite a slow leasing environment in Washington, we continue to win business. 
To start off the fourth quarter, we just executed a lease for 108,000 square feet to the Corporate Executive Board in one of our buildings that is about to be renovated in Roslyn. With this lease, we have now resolved 871,000 square feet or roughly 36% of the 2.4 million square feet of Department of Defense lease expirations resulting from Brack. This includes our plan to demolish the existing 350,000 square foot 1851 South Bell building to rebuild a new state of the art 700,000 square foot office tower at 1900 Crystal Drive. We received final full approvals from Arlington County for this project in September. Almost all of the Brack relocations have now taken place, and we are looking ahead. 
In our 20 million-square-foot portfolio, lease expirations in 2013 are below our average with a very manageable 940,000 square feet expiring. Releasing the remainder of the Brack space is a function of time, and we will emerge stronger when complete. We had a similar experience in 2004 and 2005 when the Patent and Trademark Office relocated, but in the end, we benefited by releasing to a more diverse population of tenants and by increasing rents by over 30%. We are confident the same will be true this time, too. 
For the entire Washington DC division, same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 6.9% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis due to Brack. Overall occupancy is 84%. Our residential portfolio, which consists of 2,424 units in Arlington and D.C. representing about approximately 12% of the business is over 97% occupied and had a quarterly same-store EBITDA increase of 8.5%. And finally, we are delighted to welcome Nike to Georgetown with the opening last weak of their new flagship 31,000 square foot store at our 3040 M Street property. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mike. Thank you."

I wanted to cover a few things of retail and talk a minute about sustainability. Our retail strips and mall team continue to perform. In the quarter, we had an 8.8% GAAP mark-to-market and occupancy was 93.4%. While the shakeouts in supermarket industry and the closings and downsizings associated with Best Buy and others are a concern, this nationwide trend is lest important to us because of the concentration of assets we have in the densely populated, high barrier to entry, tri-state area. Our segment is much smaller and leaner now and the numbers show it. Occupancy is up 11.6% to 94.2% as a result of the Motorola Mobility lease and EBITDA improved by $1.1 million to $13.7 million. The commitment of Motorola Mobility Google at the merchandise is having a positive ripple effect we thought it would have. We also benefited from restocking the showroom tenants in the building in a very efficient way. Let's stock sustainability for a minute. We've been working very hard on this front. Our commitment to sustainability is highlighted in our annual sustainability report available on our website and reprinted in this letter. We think sustainability is not only good business, it's morally partly responsible our profits in the end. Most recently, we are proud to have rank #1 of our entire industry and we were 87th of our America's 500 largest publicly traded companies and 500 largest companies internationally. That's quite an achievement. By the end of 2012, we will have LEED-certified over 30 million feet in our portfolio, more than any other single owner nationwide. We are a leader in energy management and submetering and our efforts have resulted and significant reduction and energy consumption throughout our portfolio.
In summary, we are very excited about the future of our great assets and businesses, which are run by a very talented management team. We will continue to make Vornado a simpler company, improving the portfolio and recycled capital and increase asset quality. I'd like to turn it over to Joe Mac now for the financial review."

Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quart",636,"Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quarter. First Call was $1.17 per share as some analysts factor in noncomparable items into their estimates and others do not. 
Our noncomparable items in this quarter consisted of a $19.7 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Canadian Trade Shows, $12.5 million of FFO from discontinued operations, a $11.7 million gain on redemption of preferred units, $4.3 million of income from the mark-to-market of the JC Penney derivative position, partially offset by a $7 million impairment in other costs. 
As Mike indicated, we announced the sale of Green Acres Mall for $500 million to the Macy's Company. Net proceeds from the sale will be $185 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. The gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $195 million. The tax gain will be approximately $304 million and is expected to be deferred as part of a exchange. The Green acres sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and is conditioned on the closing of the Kings Plaza. 
Alexander's, our 32.4% owned affiliate, also announced the sale of Kings Plaza Mall for $751 million to Net proceeds to Alexander's from the sale will be $481 million after repaying at the existing loan in closing. Alexander's gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $603 million, of which Vornado's 32.4% share will be approximately $181 million, after adjusting for certain acquisition cost in Alexander's stock. Alexander's tax gain will be approximately $625 million, which is expected to be paid out shareholders as a special long-term capital gains dividend this year. Vornado's share of the dividend is approximately $202 million or $1.02 per Vornado share and is also expected to paid out this year to Vornado shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend. The Kings Plaza sale is expected to be completed this quarter. 
We have over $2.7 billion of liquidity at September 30. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value was 36.8% and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.6x. 
In capital market transactions this quarter, we issued $300 million of 5.7% preferred shares and redeemed $255 million of preferred shares and preferred units, with a weighted average dividend cost of 6.9%. This results in $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost for rus and the $11.7 million gain and noncomparable items I just mentioned. We refinanced 2 properties for aggregate proceeds of $248 million with a weighted average term of 10 years, which resulted in $49 million of net proceeds. The weighted average interest rate of the new loans is 3.3% compared to 2.3% weighted average interest rate on the maturing loans. That is a result going from floating rate to fixed rates on one of those loans in the amount of $150 million. Now the new loan has a 12-year term fixed rate. 
We also unencumbered 2 properties by repaying $151 million outstanding balance on the mortgage loans, which added a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%, of course the source of that was our over net cash balances, which earned 0. 
Importantly, we expect to complete the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in the fourth quarter in a single asset CMBS for close to $1 billion, replacing the $409 million mortgage that now exists on the property and with a much lower interest rate. We also expect our financing acquisition of 666 Fifth Avenue retail with a $390 million mortgage. We are highly confident that the $721 million of remaining 2013 maturities will be refinanced at favorable rates as well. At this time, I'd like to turn it over for Q&A."

As I said earlier on upper Fifth Avenue, we've really seen rents approaching $3,000 a foot and that was in fact validated with the deal that we did with Mac earlier this year and again on Madison Avenue, we've seen extraordinary strength in the market. We have closed a number of deals at 11 East 68 Street, again at rents at and above $1,000 a foot. I think as you look at some of the sales numbers, I think the comment I'll make is Times Square is an extraordinary market because it's almost a 24/7 market.

That's a good example of that is a process to go through adding additional space, really working that asset over a period of time to try to create, as Joe mentioned, the 5.2% existing income going substantially up. So street retail and New York with value-added components is particularly a focus, we are looking at the lack of office buildings. I think there's an escalating volume of office deals coming to the market as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, bigger deals that might provide some opportunity. Obviously, if there's a lease rollover in some of those that will take place down the road at the effect of this the price could affect the potential so in D.C. we haven't seen much distress and asset sales despite negatively viewed market. We obviously been the net seller in D.C. and we look at all these markets to try a find deal that's in our parameters so I would say the acquisition market is not easier to find deals right now that meet that criteria because there's more money in more demand for it than I think the deals volume right now suggest so we'll continue to look at it and whether it will be in that seller or not will continue to sell remains to be seen."

We'll end at 11:00.
Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge the devastation the Northeast suffered from Hurricane Sandy. This tragedy, which cost over 100 lives, thus far, and tens of billions of property damage, affected our home bases in New York and Washington, particularly New York, which was hardest. 
I'm pleased to report that we suffered no personal injuries and only minor property damage. I want to thank all of our people for the incredible job they did and express our best wishes to all those affected by the hurricane as they recover. 
David and Mitchell will comment further, particularly David, on  specifics for their businesses. 
Overall, I'm quite satisfied with our third quarter results, which were a penny better than last year's third quarter. In spite of the downward pressure coming from BRAC in Washington, D.C., an old story. It's interesting to note that if Washington would have been level this year to last, we would have had comparable FFO performance over the prior year's quarter of 7%. 
The Washington office market is sluggish, and the New York office market, lacking support from the financial service industry, is locked in neutral. However, it is clear from our financial results that our New York portfolio is outperforming the market, and our Washington portfolio is outperforming the projections we provided in our public filings. David and Mitchell will expand on this in a few minutes. Let me update you on asset sales. Part of our program to simplify and to recycle capital into our core portfolio of high-quality office and retail assets. 
In the third quarter, we closed on the previously announced sales of the Washington Design Center, Washington Office Center, the Canadian Trade Show business in Dorchester, a non-core strip shopping center, total proceeds from these sales were $323 million, with a  third quarter net gain of $149 million. 
Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of 2 malls for $1.25 billion, the Green Acres Mall and Alexander's King Plaza Mall, which were both sold to the Macerich Company. When completed, these transactions will produce substantial proceeds and gains, and Joe will provide further detail in a few minutes on the specifics of these gains and distributions. 
We also announced the sale of Reston Executive, a 3-building suburban office complex in Fairfax County, Virginia for $126 million, resulting in a net gain of $35 million. We sold the building on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is part of The Gallery at Market East for $60 million, resulting in a gain of $35 million. We expect to close both these deals in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, we expect to close in the fourth quarter the previously announced sale of the Boston Design Center for approximately $72 million. 
Lastly, we sold our equity investment and [indiscernible] to Brookfield Asset Management for $28 million. We will continue to hold $25 million of [indiscernible] 4.75% 2018 debentures. 
In summary, this year, we produced $2.3 billion of assets sales with a net gain of $674 million and expect to pay at least a special long-term capital gain dividend of $202 million or $1.02 per share for Vornado's share of King's Plaza. 
We intend to do a tax-deferred like-kind exchange with the sale proceeds of Green Acres and others. We will continue to dispose of non-core assets. We just acquired a 25% participation in a $475 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on 710 Seventh Avenue, a retail redevelopment property in Times Square, where we already have 2 dominant properties in that market. 
The yield today is 11%, which will increase our [indiscernible senior position. We will continue to invest in our existing assets and development opportunities. Given the current environment, our strategy for acquisition will be measured and focused on continuing to expand our leading New York City street retail platform and upgrading our high-quality office property platform. 
Let me now turn the call over to David to discuss the New York business."
312648,222888286,376959,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to all. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we've been going through here in New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all o",1533,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning to all. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we've been going through here in New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all occurrences, and last Friday, as we began to receive dire warnings, we implemented our emergency management procedures, coordinating all of our personnel to have round-the-clock coverage in all of our buildings. Our engineers, quarters, security guards and property management professionals all were hunkered down during the storm. Some of them still today in buildings which are dark, literally living in the buildings, sleeping in shifts on cots. 
I'm enormously proud of our team for securing all of our buildings during the storm and for communicating, on a realtime basis, updates to all of our tenants. Most of our buildings did not lose power and have remained open throughout. Other than one small building directly in one of the flood zones downtown, which will take about a week to bring back, all of the buildings that lost power should be up and running as soon as Con Edison completes the repairs to its network, which we hope will take place this weekend.
Now let me turn to the quarter. While the overall market in New York is tepid, we've had a strong quarter. We leased over 500,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, which took our office occupancy up 50 basis points to 95.8%. 
The highlights of our leasing activity this quarter are 2 headquarters consolidation deals, one in financial services and one in advertising. 
At 350 Park, we leased 103,000 square feet to M&T Bank in a renewal and expansion transaction, which allowed M&T to consolidate its Wilmington Trust division, which it recently acquired into 350 Park Avenue. To produce the expansion space [indiscernible] to you in this complicated deal, we terminated 2 leases early and also renegotiated 2 other leases. 
At 909 3rd Avenue, we leased 220,000 square feet to IPG, the Interpublic Group, which allowed IPG to consolidate offices from 4 different locations into our building. For IPG, we created a headquarters environment, including dedicated lobby space and elevators, branding and a great outdoor terrace space. 
To make this deal, we leveraged our existing relationship with IPG, which is also our lead tenant at 100 West 33rd Street, where IPG occupies over 400,000 square feet. 
These 2 large transactions, plus another 22 leases signed in the quarter, had an average starting rent of $58.74 per square foot, with a positive mark-to-market of 8.9% cash and 5% GAAP. 
Many of the flash analyst reports, which I read last night, commented on our CapEx. Our average TIs were elevated this quarter at $56.92 per square foot. That's because 75% of this quarter's leasing activity was new and expansion deals versus 30%, which was the case in the first half of the year. 
Our year-to-date office leasing activity is a robust 1.5 million square feet, which includes some 620,000 square feet of leasing in our Penn Plaza office portfolio. The Midtown South submarket, with its tight availability, has been expanding to include Penn Plaza. In fact, Penn Plaza recently was reported to have the lowest Class A vacancy rate in Midtown at sub 5%. This has allowed us to begin to push Penn Plaza office rents and at One Penn Plaza, we recently have completed several deals over $60 per square foot. 
For our entire 19.6 million square foot office portfolio, we have a relatively modest amount of upcoming lease expirations with 156,000 square feet expiring in the balance of this year and 673,000 square feet expiring in '13. This amount of upcoming expirations has been substantially reduced as a result of our aggressive forward leasing over the last several quarters. 
Let me now spend a minute talking about some market dynamics. Since last summer, the market effectively has been at equilibrium with the Manhattan vacancy rate hovering just under 10%. Our occupancy at 95.8% continues to outperform the market, as we do quarter in and quarter out. Renewals this year have made up the bulk of the transactions in the market enabling tenants to avoid capital expenditures. In fact, in Midtown there have only been 3 major relocation deals year-to-date over 100,000 square feet, the IPG lease, I mentioned earlier, is one of those 3 deals. 
Uncertainty in the regulatory environment has also led the financial institutions to remain on the sidelines. However, our diversified portfolio of over 1,200 tenants is not reliant on any one industry. Take a look at the list of the major tenants in our New York segment property table in the financial supplement and you'll see what I mean.
In years past, view space in the tower of the building was the first to go. With affordability being the theme of today, that trend seems to have reversed somewhat as tenants are focusing on the base of buildings both for the value prospect and the flexibility larger floor plates provide for open space planning. This bodes well for the re-leasing of the former Citibank space at 666 Fifth Avenue. While you likely have read that Citi has moved out of the space, we will continue to receive rent through the lease expiration 2 years hence, giving us considerable time to re-lease the space. 
Regarding trophy space, which includes our buildings at 6 45th Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 280 Park Avenue and 350 Park Avenue, while the market is not yet back to the premium seen before the financial crisis, there have been 27 transactions over $100 per square foot year-to-date. I'm pleased to say that 3 of those $100-plus deals have been in our own portfolio and we have 2 more in the hopper. 
We have a long track record of transforming buildings to create value, having done it time and again, 770 Broadway, 1740 Broadway, 6 45th Avenue and 888 Seventh Avenue just to name a few. Earlier this year, we completed the total redevelopment of our 330 Madison property, capped by over 400,000 square feet of leasing activity, including headquarters transactions with Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle. 
At 280 Park Avenue, the transformation is now underway with our joint venture partner, SL Green. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the building will feature a new double height lobby, spanning the entire Park Avenue block front, and a winter garden interconnecting both buildings surrounded by new plazas. The receptivity to the overall redevelopment plan from the brokerage and tenant communities has been very positive. And while we are fielding lease inquiries, our experience in the many buildings we have redeveloped is that, while the renderings are great, what the tenant community and brokers really appreciate is the quality of the redevelopment when they start to see it completed. 
We have one other major transformation well underway at 1290 Avenue of the Americas where we are dramatically upgrading the scaling character of the lobby, storefront and elevators to match the stature of this 2 plus million square foot corporate headquarters building. This project is currently under construction with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2013. The change already is dramatic. I'd encourage you to go take a look. 
Turning now to our Manhattan street retail portfolio where we own the dominant 2.3 million-square-foot retail platform. We leased 180,000 square feet of retail space year-to-date with positive mark-to-markets of 19.4% cash and 27.2% GAAP. 
The retail market is very strong, driven by the continued growth in tourism, which is expected to reach 52 million visitors this year. New York continues to be the gateway market for global retailers including, for example, Massimo Dutti, one of Zara's brands, which opened its first store in the United States at our 689 Fifth Avenue property last month. Retail rents are now well above their all-time highs, approaching $3,000 per square foot on 5th Avenue and $2,000 per square foot in Times Square. 
In Times Square, last week, Microsoft opened a pop-up store at our 1540 Broadway property for the global launch of its new surface tablet computers. Sales here have exceeded Microsoft's expectations, which again demonstrates the strength of the Times Square market. Both Massimo Dutti and Microsoft deals speak to the exceptional quality of our Manhattan street retail portfolio. We continue to have great growth prospects in this portfolio of extremely well-located assets with in-place rents averaging 30% under market and, by the way, many individual assets are multiples of that. We couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the development of the full block front of retail signage at Marriott Marquis, which is directly across from 1540 Broadway, the 2 best sites, by far, in Times Square. 
For the entire year New York division, which is a total of 25.5 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 0.7% cash and 0.3% GAAP. If you exclude the Hotel Penn, which was weak this quarter, along with the rest of the New York hotel market, the same-store increase is positive 1.9% cash and 1.3% GAAP. Now let me turn it back over to Mike."

While we, in Washington, largely dodged Sandy, I have an incredibly competent team on the ground that was fully prepared for the worst. Our colleagues in New York bore the brunt of it and really did a yeoman's job during this crisis. As you may know, our Washington portfolio is approximately 20 million square feet, concentrated in Washington, D.C. and Arlington, Virginia directly across the Potomac River in Crystal City, Pentagon City and Rosslyn. Our footprint is about twice the size of any of our peers. 
I want to start by contextualizing the Washington Metro market, in general. Currently, market demand is soft, but not as soft as many believe, as tenants await election results and clarity on the budget crisis. There is leasing activity in the market. In 2012, the gross leasing activity is expected to be about 32 million square feet, which is actually on par with the 15-year average. There is a lot of churn but not yet enough absorption to eat into vacancies, especially in this peak BRAC year. Through 3 quarters of this year, there was negative absorption of about 2.5 million square feet in the market. Rents are holding steady but concessions are up to attract tenants. Limited supply over the next several years will help to stabilize the market, but we don't really expect the market to gain significant traction until 2014. 
Within our Washington portfolio, our year-to-date leasing velocity has been brisk. Over 1.6 million square feet so far, well ahead of our projection for the full year. We are attracting good activity and consistently executing more than our fair share of deals at good risks. 
In fact, we have signed 6 new leases, each one of them over 50,000 square feet as compared to one new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011. In the third quarter, specifically, we leased 435,000 square feet at very good average initial rents of $44.02 per square foot, and this is versus 389,000 square feet leased in the same quarter last year. The GAAP mark-to-market was 13.8%, and the cash mark-to-market was 8.9%. Of the total 435,000 square feet leased this quarter, government leases accounted for 170,000 square feet and the private sector leased 265,000 square feet. So despite a slow leasing environment in Washington, we continue to win business. 
To start off the fourth quarter, we just executed a lease for 108,000 square feet to the Corporate Executive Board in one of our buildings that is about to be renovated in  Rosslyn. With this lease, we have now resolved 871,000 square feet, or roughly 36%, of the 2.4 million square feet of Department of Defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC. This includes our plan to demolish the existing 350,000 square foot 1851 South Bell building to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower at 1900 Crystal Drive. We received final, full approvals from Arlington County for this project in September. Almost all of the BRAC relocations have now taken place and we are looking ahead. 
In our 20 million-square-foot portfolio, lease expirations in 2013 are below our average, with a very manageable 940,000 square feet expiring. Re-leasing the remainder of the BRAC space is a function of time and we will emerge stronger when complete. We had a similar experience in 2004 and 2005 when the Patent and Trademark Office relocated, but in the end, we benefited by re-leasing to a more diverse population of tenants and by increasing rents by over 30%. We are confident the same will be true this time, too. 
For the entire Washington DC division, same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 6.9% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis due to BRAC. Overall occupancy is 84%. 
Our residential portfolio, which consists of 2,424 units in Arlington and D.C., representing about approximately 12% of the business, is over 97% occupied and had a quarterly same-store EBITDA increase of 8.5%. And finally, we are delighted to welcome Nike to Georgetown with the opening last weak of their new flagship 31,000 square foot store at our 3040 M Street property. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mike. Thank you."

I want to cover a few things at retail, non-New York City retail mart, and talk a minute about sustainability. Our retail strips and mall team continue to perform. In the quarter, we had an 8.8% GAAP mark-to-market and occupancy was 93.4%. While the shakeouts in supermarket industry, in the closings and downsizings, associated with Best Buy and others, are a concern, this nationwide trend is less important to us because of the concentration of assets we have in the densely populated, high barrier to entry, affluent tri-state area. Our Mart segment is much smaller and leaner now and the numbers show it. Occupancy is up 11.6% to 94.2% as a result of the Motorola Mobility-Google lease and EBITDA improved by $1.1 million to $13.7 million. The commitment of Motorola Mobility-Google at the merchandise mart is having the positive ripple effect we thought it would have. We also benefited from restacking the showroom tenants in the building in a very efficient way. 
Let's talk sustainability for a minute. We've been working very hard on this front. Our commitment to sustainability is highlighted in our annual sustainability report available on our website and reprinted in Steve's chairman letter. We think sustainability is not only good business and it's morally responsible and works our increase our profits in the end. Most recently, we are proud to have ranked #1 in Newsworks' green rankings of our entire industry, and we were 87th of our America's 500 largest publicly-traded companies and 500 largest companies internationally. That's quite an achievement. 
By the end of 2012, we will have LEED-certified over 30 million feet in our portfolio, more than any other single owner nationwide. We are a leader in energy management and sub-metering, and our efforts have resulted in significant reduction in  energy consumption throughout our portfolio.
In summary, we are very excited about the future of our great assets and businesses, which are run by a very talented management team. We will continue to make Vornado a simpler company, improving the portfolio and recycle capital and increase asset quality. I'd like to turn it over to Joe Mac now for the financial review."

Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quart",642,"Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quarter. First Call was $1.17 per share as some analysts factor in noncomparable items into their estimates and others do not. 
Our noncomparable items in this quarter consisted of a $19.7 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Canadian Trade Shows, $12.5 million of FFO from discontinued operations and $11.7 million gain on redemption of preferred units, $4.3 million of income from the mark-to-market of the JC Penney derivative position, partially offset by a $7 million Verde impairment and other costs. 
As Mike indicated, we announced the sale of Green Acres Mall for $500 million to the Macerich Company. Net proceeds from the sale will be $185 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. The gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $195 million. The tax gain will be approximately $304 million and is expected to be deferred as part of a like-kind exchange. The Green Acres sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and is conditioned on the closing of the King's Plaza Mall. 
Alexander's, our 32.4% owned affiliate, also announced the sale of King's Plaza Mall for $751 million to Macerich. Net proceeds to Alexander's from this sale will be $481 million after repaying at the existing loan in closing costs. Alexander's gain, for financial statement purposes, will be approximately $603 million, of which Vornado's 32.4% share will be approximately $181 million, after adjusting for certain acquisition cost in Alexander's stock. Alexander's tax gain will be approximately $625 million, which is expected to be paid out to shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend this year. Vornado's share of the dividend is approximately $202 million or $1.02 per Vornado share and is also expected to paid out this year to Vornado shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend. The King's Plaza sale is expected to be completed this quarter. 
We have over $2.7 billion of liquidity at September 30. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value was 36.8% and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.6x. 
In capital market transactions this quarter, we issued $300 million of 5.7% preferred shares and redeemed $255 million of preferred shares and preferred units, with a weighted average dividend cost of 6.9%. This results in $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost to us and the $11.7 million gain in noncomparable items I just mentioned. 
We refinanced 2 properties for aggregate proceeds of $248 million with a weighted average term of 10 years, which resulted in $49 million of net proceeds. The weighted average interest rate of the new loans is 3.3% compared to 2.3% weighted average interest rate on the maturing loans. That's as a result of going from floating rate to fixed rate on one of those loans in the amount of $150 million. Now the new loan has a 12-year term, fixed rate. 
We also unencumbered 2 properties by repaying $151 million outstanding balance on the mortgage loans, which added a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Of course, the source of that was our overnight cash balances, which earned 0. 
Importantly, we expect to complete the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in the fourth quarter in a single asset CMBS for close to $1 billion, replacing the $409 million mortgage that now exists on the property and with a much lower interest rate. We also expect our financing acquisition of 656 Fifth Avenue retail with a $390 million mortgage. We are highly confident that the $721 million of remaining 2013 maturities will be refinanced at favorable rates as well. At this time, I'd like to turn it over for Q&A."

We'll end at 11:00.
Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge the devastation the Northeast suffered from Hurricane Sandy. This tragedy, which cost over 100 lives, thus far, and tens of billions of property damage, affected our home bases in New York and Washington, particularly New York, which was hardest hit. 
And I'm pleased to report that we've suffered no personal injuries and only minor property damage. I want to thank all of our people for the incredible job they did and express our best wishes to all those affected by the hurricane as they recover. 
David and Mitchell will comment further, particularly David, on  the specifics for their businesses. 
Overall, I'm quite satisfied with our third quarter results, which were a penny better than last year's third quarter. In spite of the downward pressure coming from BRAC in Washington, D.C., an old story. It's interesting to note that if Washington would have been level this year to last, we would have had comparable FFO performance over the prior year's quarter of 7%. 
The Washington office market is sluggish, and the New York office market, lacking support from the financial service industry, is locked in neutral. However, it is clear from our financial results that our New York portfolio is outperforming the market, and our Washington portfolio is outperforming the projections we provided in our public filings. David and Mitchell will expand on this in a few minutes. 
Let me update you on asset sales. Part of our program to simplify and to recycle capital into our core portfolio of high-quality office and retail assets.  In the third quarter, we closed on the previously announced sales of the Washington Design Center, Washington Office Center, the Canadian Trade Show business in Dorchester, a non-core strip shopping center.  Total proceeds from these sales were $323 million, with a  third quarter net gain of $149 million. 
Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of 2 malls for $1.25 billion, the Green Acres Mall and Alexander's King Plaza Mall, which were both sold to the Macerich Company. When completed, these transactions will produce substantial proceeds and gains, and Joe will provide further detail in a few minutes on the specifics of these gains and distributions. 
We also announced the sale of Resston Executive, a 3-building suburban office complex in Fairfax County, Virginia, for $126 million, resulting in a net gain of $35 million. We sold the building on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is part of The Gallery at Market East, for $60 million, resulting in a gain of $35 million. We expect to close both these deals in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, we expect to close in the fourth quarter the previously announced sale of the Boston Design Center for approximately $72 million. 
Lastly, we sold our equity investment and [indiscernible] to Brookfield Asset Management for $28 million. We will continue to hold $25 million of [indiscernible] 4.75% 2018 debentures. 
In summary, this year, we produced $2.3 billion of assets sales with a net gain of $674 million and expect to pay at least a special long-term capital gain dividend of $202 million or $1.02 per share for Vornado's share of King's Plaza. 
We intend to do a tax-deferred like-kind exchange with the sale proceeds of Green Acres and others. We will continue to dispose of non-core assets. We just acquired a 25% participation in a $475 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on 701 Seventh Avenue, a retail redevelopment property in Times Square, where we already have 2 dominant properties in that market. 
The yield today is 11%, which will increase our [indiscernible senior position. We will continue to invest in our existing assets and development opportunities. Given the current environment, our strategy for acquisition will be measured and focused on continuing to expand our leading New York City street retail platform and upgrading our high-quality office property platform. 
Let me now turn the call over to David to discuss the New York business."
312648,222888286,377271,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to all.

Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we've been going through here in New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all occurrences, and last Friday, as we began to receive dire warnings, we implemented our emergency management procedures, coordinating all of our personnel to have round-the-clock coverage in all of our buildings. Our engineers, quarters, security guards and property management professionals all were hunkered down during the storm. Some of them still today in buildings which are dark, literally living in the buildings, sleeping in shifts on cots. 
I'm enormously proud of our team for securing all of our buildings during the storm and for communicating, on a realtime basis, updates to all of our tenants. Most of our buildings did not lose power and have remained open throughout. Other than one small building directly in one of the flood zones downtown, which will take about a week to bring back, all of the buildings that lost power should be up and running as soon as Con Edison completes the repairs to its network, which we hope will take place this weekend.
Now let me turn to the quarter. While the overall market in New York is tepid, we've had a strong quarter. We leased over 500,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, which took our office occupancy up 50 basis points to 95.8%. 
The highlights of our leasing activity this quarter are 2 headquarters consolidation deals, one in financial services and one in advertising. 
At 350 Park, we leased 103,000 square feet to M&T Bank in a renewal and expansion transaction, which allowed M&T to consolidate its Wilmington Trust division, which it recently acquired into 350 Park Avenue. To produce the expansion space [indiscernible] in this complicated deal, we terminated 2 leases early and also renegotiated 2 other leases. 
At 909 Third Avenue, we leased 220,000 square feet to IPG, the Interpublic Group, which allowed IPG to consolidate offices from 4 different locations into our building. For IPG, we created a headquarters environment, including dedicated lobby space and elevators, branding and a great outdoor terrace space. 
To make this deal, we leveraged our existing relationship with IPG, which is also our lead tenant at 100 West 33rd Street, where IPG occupies over 400,000 square feet. 
These 2 large transactions, plus another 22 leases signed in the quarter, had an average starting rent of $58.74 per square foot, with a positive mark-to-market of 8.9% cash and 5% GAAP. 
Many of the flash analyst reports, which I read last night, commented on our CapEx. Our average TIs were elevated this quarter at $56.92 per square foot. That's because 75% of this quarter's leasing activity was new and expansion deals versus 30%, which was the case in the first half of the year. 
Our year-to-date office leasing activity is a robust 1.5 million square feet, which includes some 620,000 square feet of leasing in our Penn Plaza office portfolio. The Midtown South submarket, with its tight availability, has been expanding to include Penn Plaza. In fact, Penn Plaza recently was reported to have the lowest Class A vacancy rate in Midtown at sub 5%. This has allowed us to begin to push Penn Plaza office rents and at One Penn Plaza, we recently have completed several deals over $60 per square foot. 
For our entire 19.6 million square foot office portfolio, we have a relatively modest amount of upcoming lease expirations with 156,000 square feet expiring in the balance of this year and 673,000 square feet expiring in '13. This amount of upcoming expirations has been substantially reduced as a result of our aggressive forward leasing over the last several quarters. 
Let me now spend a minute talking about some market dynamics. Since last summer, the market effectively has been at equilibrium with the Manhattan vacancy rate hovering just under 10%. Our occupancy at 95.8% continues to outperform the market, as we do quarter in and quarter out. Renewals this year have made up the bulk of the transactions in the market enabling tenants to avoid capital expenditures. In fact, in Midtown there have only been 3 major relocation deals year-to-date over 100,000 square feet.  The IPG lease, I mentioned earlier, is one of those 3 deals. 
Uncertainty in the regulatory environment has also led the financial institutions to remain on the sidelines. However, our diversified portfolio of over 1,200 tenants is not reliant on any one industry. Take a look at the list of the major tenants in our New York segment property table in the financial supplement and you'll see what I mean.
In years past, view space in the tower of the building was the first to go. With affordability being the theme of today, that trend seems to have reversed somewhat as tenants are focusing on the base of buildings, both for the value prospect and the flexibility larger floor plates provide for open space planning. This bodes well for the re-leasing of the former Citibank space at 666 Fifth Avenue. While you likely have read that Citi has moved out of the space, we will continue to receive rent through the lease expiration 2 years hence, giving us considerable time to re-lease the space. 
Regarding trophy space, which includes our buildings at 6 45th Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 280 Park Avenue and 350 Park Avenue, while the market is not yet back to the premium seen before the financial crisis, there have been 27 transactions over $100 per square foot year-to-date. I'm pleased to say that 3 of those $100-plus deals have been in our own portfolio and we have 2 more in the hopper. 
We have a long track record of transforming buildings to create value, having done it time and again, 770 Broadway, 1740 Broadway, 6 45th Avenue and 888 Seventh Avenue to just name a few. Earlier this year, we completed the total redevelopment of our 330 Madison Avenue property, capped by over 400,000 square feet of leasing activity, including headquarters transactions with Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle. 
At 280 Park Avenue, the transformation is now underway with our joint venture partner, SL Green. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the building will feature a new double height lobby, spanning the entire Park Avenue block front, and a winter garden interconnecting both buildings surrounded by new plazas. The receptivity to the overall redevelopment plan from the brokerage and tenant communities has been very positive. And while we are fielding lease inquiries, our experience in the many buildings we have redeveloped is that, while the renderings are great, what the tenant community and brokers really appreciate is the quality of the redevelopment when they start to see it completed. 
We have one other major transformation well underway at 1290 Avenue of the Americas where we are dramatically upgrading the scaling character of the lobby, storefront and elevators to match the stature of this 2 plus million square foot corporate headquarters building. This project is currently under construction with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2013. The change already is dramatic. I'd encourage you to go take a look. 
Turning now to our Manhattan street retail portfolio where we own the dominant 2.3 million-square-foot retail platform. We leased 183,000 square feet of retail space year-to-date with positive mark-to-markets of 19.4% cash and 27.2% GAAP. 
The retail market is very strong, driven by the continued growth in tourism, which is expected to reach 52 million visitors this year. New York continues to be the gateway market for global retailers including, for example, Massimo Dutti, one of Zara's brands, which opened its first store in the United States at our 689 Fifth Avenue property last month. Retail rents are now well above their all-time highs, approaching $3,000 per square foot on Fifth Avenue and $2,000 per square foot in Times Square. 
In Times Square, last week, Microsoft opened a pop-up store at our 1540 Broadway property for the global launch of its new surface tablet computer. Sales here have exceeded Microsoft's expectations, which again demonstrates the strength of the Times Square market. Both Massimo Dutti and Microsoft deals speak to the exceptional quality of our Manhattan street retail portfolio. We continue to have great growth prospects in this portfolio of extremely well-located assets with in-place rents averaging 30% under market and, by the way, many individual assets are multiples of that. We couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the development of the full block front of retail signage at Marriott Marquis, which is directly across from 1540 Broadway, the 2 best sites, by far, in Times Square. 
For the entire year New York division, which is a total of 25.5 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 0.7% cash and 0.3% GAAP. If you exclude the Hotel Penn, which was weak this quarter, along with the rest of the New York hotel market, the same-store increase is positive 1.9% cash and 1.3% GAAP. Now let me turn it back over to Mike."

While we, in Washington, largely dodged Sandy, I have an incredibly competent team on the ground that was fully prepared for the worst. Our colleagues in New York bore the brunt of it and really did a yeoman's job during this crisis. As you may know, our Washington portfolio is approximately 20 million square feet, concentrated in Washington, D.C. and Arlington, Virginia directly across the Potomac River in Crystal City, Pentagon City and Rosslyn. Our footprint is about twice the size of any of our peers. 
I want to start by contextualizing the Washington Metro market, in general. Currently, market demand is soft, but not as soft as many believe, as tenants await election results and clarity on the budget crisis. There is leasing activity in the market. In 2012, the gross leasing activity is expected to be about 32 million square feet, which is actually on par with the 15-year average. There is a lot of churn but not yet enough absorption to eat into vacancies, especially in this peak BRAC year. Through 3 quarters of this year, there was negative absorption of about 2.5 million square feet in the market. Rents are holding steady but concessions are up to attract tenants. Limited supply over the next several years will help to stabilize the market, but we don't really expect the market to gain significant traction until 2014. 
Within our Washington portfolio, our year-to-date leasing velocity has been brisk. Over 1.6 million square feet so far, well ahead of our projection for the full year. We are attracting good activity and consistently executing more than our fair share of deals at good risks. 
In fact, we have signed 6 new leases, each one of them over 50,000 square feet as compared to one new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011. In the third quarter, specifically, we leased 435,000 square feet at very good average initial rents of $44.02 per square foot, and this is versus 389,000 square feet leased in the same quarter last year. The GAAP mark-to-market was 13.8%, and the cash mark-to-market was 8.9%. Of the total 435,000 square feet leased this quarter, government leases accounted for 170,000 square feet and the private sector leased 265,000 square feet. So despite a slow leasing environment in Washington, we continue to win business. 
To start off the fourth quarter, we just executed a lease for 108,000 square feet to the Corporate Executive Board in one of our buildings that is about to be renovated in  Rosslyn. With this lease, we have now resolved 871,000 square feet, or roughly 36%, of the 2.4 million square feet of Department of Defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC. This includes our plan to demolish the existing 350,000 square foot 1851 South Bell building to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower at 1900 Crystal Drive. We received final, full approvals from Arlington County for this project in September. Almost all of the BRAC relocations have now taken place and we are looking ahead. 
In our 20 million-square-foot portfolio, lease expirations in 2013 are below our average, with a very manageable 940,000 square feet expiring. Re-leasing the remainder of the BRAC space is a function of time and we will emerge stronger when complete. We had a similar experience in 2004 and 2005 when the Patent and Trademark Office relocated, but in the end, we benefited by re-leasing to a more diverse population of tenants and by increasing rents by over 30%. We are confident the same will be true this time, too. 
For the entire Washington DC division, same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 6.9% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis due to BRAC. Overall occupancy is 84%. 
Our residential portfolio, which consists of 2,424 units in Arlington and D.C., representing approximately 12% of the business, is over 97% occupied and had a quarterly same-store EBITDA increase of 8.5%. And finally, we are delighted to welcome Nike to Georgetown with the opening last weak of their new flagship 31,000 square foot store at our 3040 M Street property. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mike. Thank you."

I wanted to cover a few things of retail -- non-New York City retail in the Mart, and talk a minute about sustainability. Our retail strips and mall team continue to perform. In the quarter, we had an 8.8% GAAP mark-to-market and occupancy was 93.4%. While the shakeouts in supermarket industry and the closings and downsizings associated with Best Buy and others are a concern, this nationwide trend is less important to us because of the concentration of assets we have in the densely populated, high barrier to entry, affluent tri-state area. Our Mart segment is much smaller and leaner now and the numbers show it. Occupancy is up to 11 -- up 11.6% to 94.2% as a result of the Motorola Mobility-Google lease and EBITDA improved by $1.1 million to $13.7 million. The commitment of Motorola Mobility-Google at the Merchandise Mart is having the positive ripple effect we thought it would have. We also benefited from restacking the showroom tenants in the building in a very efficient way. 
Let's talk sustainability for a minute. We've been working very hard on this front. Our commitment to sustainability is highlighted in our annual sustainability report available on our website and reprinted in Steve's chairman letter. We think sustainability is not only good business, that it's morally responsible and works to increase our profits in the end. Most recently, we are proud to have ranked #1 in Newsweek's Green Rankings of our entire industry, and we were 87th among America's 500 largest publicly-traded companies and 500 largest companies internationally. That's quite an achievement. 
By the end of 2012, we will have LEED-certified over 30 million feet in our portfolio, more than any other single owner nationwide. We are a leader in energy management and sub-metering, and our efforts have resulted in significant reduction in  energy consumption throughout our portfolio.
In summary, we are very excited about the future of our great assets and businesses, which are run by a very talented management team. We will continue to make Vornado a simpler company, improving the portfolio and recycle capital and increase asset quality. I'd like to turn it over to Joe Mac now for the financial review."

Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quart",641,"Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quarter. First Call was $1.17 per share as some analysts factor in noncomparable items into their estimates and others do not. 
Our noncomparable items in this quarter consisted of a $19.7 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Canadian Trade Shows, $12.5 million of FFO from discontinued operations, an $11.7 million gain on redemption of preferred units, $4.3 million of income from the mark-to-market of the JCPenney derivative position, partially offset by a $7 million Verde impairment and other costs. 
As Mike indicated, we announced the sale of Green Acres Mall for $500 million to the Macerich Company. Net proceeds from the sale will be $185 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. The gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $195 million. The tax gain will be approximately $304 million and is expected to be deferred as part of a like-kind exchange. The Green Acres sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and is conditioned on the closing of the King's Plaza Mall. 
Alexander's, our 32.4% owned affiliate, also announced the sale of King's Plaza Mall for $751 million to Macerich. Net proceeds to Alexander's from this sale will be $481 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. Alexander's gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $603 million, of which Vornado's 32.4% share will be approximately $181 million, after adjusting for certain acquisition costs in Alexander's stock. Alexander's tax gain will be approximately $625 million, which is expected to be paid out to shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend this year. Vornado's share of the dividend is approximately $202 million or $1.02 per Vornado share and is also expected to paid out this year to Vornado shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend. The King's Plaza sale is expected to be completed this quarter. 
We have over $2.7 billion of liquidity at September 30. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value was 36.8% and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.6x. 
In capital market transactions this quarter, we issued $300 million of 5.7% preferred shares and redeemed $255 million of preferred shares and preferred units, with a weighted average dividend cost of 6.9%. This results in $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost to us and the $11.7 million gain in noncomparable items I just mentioned. 
We refinanced 2 properties for aggregate proceeds of $248 million with a weighted average term of 10 years, which resulted in $49 million of net proceeds. The weighted average interest rate of the new loans is 3.3% compared to 2.3% weighted average interest rate on the maturing loans. That's as a result of going from floating rate to fixed rate on one of those loans in the amount of $150 million. Now the new loan has a 12-year term, fixed rate. 
We also unencumbered 2 properties by repaying $151 million outstanding balance on the mortgage loans, which added a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Of course, the source of that was our overnight cash balances, which earned 0. 
Importantly, we expect to complete the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in the fourth quarter in a single asset CMBS for close to $1 billion, replacing the $409 million mortgage that now exists on the property and with a much lower interest rate. We also expect to finance the acquisition of 656 Fifth Avenue retail with a $390 million mortgage.

As I said earlier, on upper Fifth Avenue, we've really seen rents approaching $3,000 a foot and that was in fact validated with the deal that we did at 689 Fifth Avenue with Mac earlier this year. And again on Madison Avenue, we've seen extraordinary strengths in the market. We have closed a number of deals at 11 East 68th Street, again, at rents at and above $1,000 a foot. I think as you look at some of the sales numbers, I guess the comment I'll make is, Times Square is an extraordinary market because it's almost a 24/7 market.

We look at the overall return we could create over a period of time and sometimes we're buying well below market leases that would justify a much lower cap rate that we could turn in a period of years into a much higher yield. So the 5.2% doesn't really relate to the overall cost of capital of 8%, it's really what the asset can perform and generate over a period of time. So whether it's the Marriott deal, or whether it's another deal, we look at that over a period of a holding period, which would be as long as 5 to 10 years, or longer, and then that has to meet the -- that clear that hurdle of our cost of capital."

We're certainly going to sell assets, and if we found great acquisitions we would proceed with those. We've been focusing on the core markets that we're in. We're are focusing on the street retail in New York, as David mentioned before. Particularly for value-added opportunities that may come with some re-leasing down the road or redevelopment down the road. Marriott is a good example of that. There's a process to go through, adding additional space, really working that asset over a period of time to try to create, as Joe mentioned, the 5.2% existing income going substantially up. So street retail in New York with value-added components is particularly a focus. We are looking to get a lot of office buildings. I think there's an escalating volume of office deals coming to the market as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, bigger deals that might provide some opportunity. Obviously, if there's a lease rollover in some of those that will take place down the road, that could affect the, obviously, pricing, could affect the return potential. So in D.C., we haven't seen much distress in asset sales despite what a negatively viewed market. [indiscernible] We've obviously been a net seller in D.C.

We'll end at 11:00.
Before getting started, I would like to acknowledge the devastation the Northeast suffered from Hurricane Sandy. This tragedy, which cost over 100 lives, thus far, and tens of billions of property damage, affected our home bases in New York and Washington, particularly New York, which was hardest hit. 
And I'm pleased to report that we've suffered no personal injuries and only minor property damage. I want to thank all of our people for the incredible job they did and express our best wishes to all those affected by the hurricane as they recover. 
David and Mitchell will comment further, particularly David, on  the specifics for their businesses. 
Overall, I'm quite satisfied with our third quarter results, which were a penny better than last year's third quarter. In spite of the downward pressure coming from BRAC in Washington, D.C., an old story. It's interesting to note that if Washington would have been level this year to last, we would have had comparable FFO performance over the prior year's quarter of 7%. 
The Washington office market is sluggish, and the New York office market, lacking support from the financial service industry, is locked in neutral. However, it is clear from our financial results that our New York portfolio is outperforming the market, and our Washington portfolio is outperforming the projections we provided in our public filings. David and Mitchell will expand on this in a few minutes. 
Let me update you on asset sales. Part of our program to simplify and to recycle capital into our core portfolio of high-quality office and retail assets.  In the third quarter, we closed on the previously announced sales of the Washington Design Center, Washington Office Center, the Canadian Trade Show business in Dorchester, a non-core strip shopping center.  Total proceeds from these sales were $323 million, with a  third quarter net gain of $149 million. 
Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of 2 malls for $1.25 billion, the Green Acres Mall and Alexander's King Plaza Mall, which were both sold to the Macerich Company. When completed, these transactions will produce substantial proceeds and gains, and Joe will provide further detail in a few minutes on the specifics of these gains and distributions. 
We also announced the sale of Reston Executive, a 3-building suburban office complex in Fairfax County, Virginia, for $126 million, resulting in a net gain of $35 million. We sold the building on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is part of The Gallery at Market East, for $60 million, resulting in a gain of $35 million. We expect to close both these deals in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, we expect to close in the fourth quarter the previously announced sale of the Boston Design Center for approximately $72 million. 
Lastly, we sold our equity investment and [indiscernible] to Brookfield Asset Management for $28 million. We will continue to hold $25 million of [indiscernible] 4.75% 2018 debentures. 
In summary, this year, we produced $2.3 billion of assets sales with a net gain of $674 million and expect to pay at least a special long-term capital gain dividend of $202 million or $1.02 per share for Vornado's share of King's Plaza. 
We intend to do a tax-deferred like-kind exchange with the sale proceeds of Green Acres and others. We will continue to dispose of non-core assets. We just acquired a 25% participation in a $475 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan on 701 Seventh Avenue, a retail redevelopment property in Times Square, where we already have 2 dominant properties in that market. 
The yield today is 11%, which will increase our [indiscernible senior position. We will continue to invest in our existing assets and development opportunities. Given the current environment, our strategy for acquisition will be measured and focused on continuing to expand our leading New York City street retail platform and upgrading our high-quality office property platform. 
Let me now turn the call over to David to discuss the New York business."
312648,222888286,378329,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to all. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we've been going through here in New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all o",1532,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning to all. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I do want to spend a minute talking about what we've been going through here in New York City over the past several days. We have contingency plans for almost all occurrences, and last Friday, as we began to receive dire warnings, we implemented our emergency management procedures, coordinating all of our personnel to have round-the-clock coverage in all of our buildings. Our engineers, quarters, security guards and property management professionals all were hunkered down during the storm. Some of them still today in buildings which are dark, literally living in the buildings, sleeping in shifts on cots. 
I'm enormously proud of our team for securing all of our buildings during the storm and for communicating, on a realtime basis, updates to all of our tenants. Most of our buildings did not lose power and have remained open throughout. Other than one small building directly in one of the flood zones downtown, which will take about a week to bring back, all of the buildings that lost power should be up and running as soon as Con Edison completes the repairs to its network, which we hope will take place this weekend.
Now let me turn to the quarter. While the overall market in New York is tepid, we've had a strong quarter. We leased over 500,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, which took our office occupancy up 50 basis points to 95.8%. 
The highlights of our leasing activity this quarter are 2 headquarters consolidation deals, one in financial services and one in advertising. 
At 350 Park, we leased 103,000 square feet to M&T Bank in a renewal and expansion transaction, which allowed M&T to consolidate its Wilmington Trust division, which it recently acquired into 350 Park Avenue. To produce the expansion space [indiscernible] in this complicated deal, we terminated 2 leases early and also renegotiated 2 other leases. 
At 909 Third Avenue, we leased 220,000 square feet to IPG, the Interpublic Group, which allowed IPG to consolidate offices from 4 different locations into our building. For IPG, we created a headquarters environment, including dedicated lobby space and elevators, branding and a great outdoor terrace space. 
To make this deal, we leveraged our existing relationship with IPG, which is also our lead tenant at 100 West 33rd Street, where IPG occupies over 400,000 square feet. 
These 2 large transactions, plus another 22 leases signed in the quarter, had an average starting rent of $58.74 per square foot, with a positive mark-to-market of 8.9% cash and 5% GAAP. 
Many of the flash analyst reports, which I read last night, commented on our CapEx. Our average TIs were elevated this quarter at $56.92 per square foot. That's because 75% of this quarter's leasing activity was new and expansion deals versus 30%, which was the case in the first half of the year. 
Our year-to-date office leasing activity is a robust 1.5 million square feet, which includes some 620,000 square feet of leasing in our Penn Plaza office portfolio. The Midtown South submarket, with its tight availability, has been expanding to include Penn Plaza. In fact, Penn Plaza recently was reported to have the lowest Class A vacancy rate in Midtown at sub 5%. This has allowed us to begin to push Penn Plaza office rents and at One Penn Plaza, we recently have completed several deals over $60 per square foot. 
For our entire 19.6 million square foot office portfolio, we have a relatively modest amount of upcoming lease expirations with 156,000 square feet expiring in the balance of this year and 673,000 square feet expiring in '13. This amount of upcoming expirations has been substantially reduced as a result of our aggressive forward leasing over the last several quarters. 
Let me now spend a minute talking about some market dynamics. Since last summer, the market effectively has been at equilibrium with the Manhattan vacancy rate hovering just under 10%. Our occupancy at 95.8% continues to outperform the market, as we do quarter in and quarter out. Renewals this year have made up the bulk of the transactions in the market enabling tenants to avoid capital expenditures. In fact, in Midtown there have only been 3 major relocation deals year-to-date over 100,000 square feet.  The IPG lease, I mentioned earlier, is one of those 3 deals. 
Uncertainty in the regulatory environment has also led the financial institutions to remain on the sidelines. However, our diversified portfolio of over 1,200 tenants is not reliant on any one industry. Take a look at the list of the major tenants in our New York segment property table in the financial supplement and you'll see what I mean.
In years past, view space in the tower of the building was the first to go. With affordability being the theme of today, that trend seems to have reversed somewhat as tenants are focusing on the base of buildings, both for the value prospect and the flexibility larger floor plates provide for open space planning. This bodes well for the re-leasing of the former Citibank space at 666 Fifth Avenue. While you likely have read that Citi has moved out of the space, we will continue to receive rent through the lease expiration 2 years hence, giving us considerable time to re-lease the space. 
Regarding trophy space, which includes our buildings at 6 45th Avenue, 888 Seventh Avenue, 280 Park Avenue and 350 Park Avenue, while the market is not yet back to the premium seen before the financial crisis, there have been 27 transactions over $100 per square foot year-to-date. I'm pleased to say that 3 of those $100-plus deals have been in our own portfolio and we have 2 more in the hopper. 
We have a long track record of transforming buildings to create value, having done it time and again, 770 Broadway, 1740 Broadway, 6 45th Avenue and 888 Seventh Avenue to just name a few. Earlier this year, we completed the total redevelopment of our 330 Madison Avenue property, capped by over 400,000 square feet of leasing activity, including headquarters transactions with Guggenheim Partners and Jones Lang LaSalle. 
At 280 Park Avenue, the transformation is now underway with our joint venture partner, SL Green. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the building will feature a new double height lobby, spanning the entire Park Avenue block front, and a winter garden interconnecting both buildings surrounded by new plazas. The receptivity to the overall redevelopment plan from the brokerage and tenant communities has been very positive. And while we are fielding lease inquiries, our experience in the many buildings we have redeveloped is that, while the renderings are great, what the tenant community and brokers really appreciate is the quality of the redevelopment when they start to see it completed. 
We have one other major transformation well underway at 1290 Avenue of the Americas where we are dramatically upgrading the scaling character of the lobby, storefront and elevators to match the stature of this 2 plus million square foot corporate headquarters building. This project is currently under construction with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2013. The change already is dramatic. I'd encourage you to go take a look. 
Turning now to our Manhattan street retail portfolio where we own the dominant 2.3 million-square-foot retail platform. We leased 183,000 square feet of retail space year-to-date with positive mark-to-markets of 19.4% cash and 27.2% GAAP. 
The retail market is very strong, driven by the continued growth in tourism, which is expected to reach 52 million visitors this year. New York continues to be the gateway market for global retailers including, for example, Massimo Dutti, one of Zara's brands, which opened its first store in the United States at our 689 Fifth Avenue property last month. Retail rents are now well above their all-time highs, approaching $3,000 per square foot on Fifth Avenue and $2,000 per square foot in Times Square. 
In Times Square, last week, Microsoft opened a pop-up store at our 1540 Broadway property for the global launch of its new surface tablet computer. Sales here have exceeded Microsoft's expectations, which again demonstrates the strength of the Times Square market. Both Massimo Dutti and Microsoft deals speak to the exceptional quality of our Manhattan street retail portfolio. We continue to have great growth prospects in this portfolio of extremely well-located assets with in-place rents averaging 30% under market and, by the way, many individual assets are multiples of that. We couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the development of the full block front of retail signage at Marriott Marquis, which is directly across from 1540 Broadway, the 2 best sites, by far, in Times Square. 
For the entire year New York division, which is a total of 25.5 million square feet, we had a good quarter with positive same-store of 0.7% cash and 0.3% GAAP. If you exclude the Hotel Penn, which was weak this quarter, along with the rest of the New York hotel market, the same-store increase is positive 1.9% cash and 1.3% GAAP. Now let me turn it back over to Mike."

While we, in Washington, largely dodged Sandy, I have an incredibly competent team on the ground that was fully prepared for the worst. Our colleagues in New York bore the brunt of it and really did a yeoman's job during this crisis. As you may know, our Washington portfolio is approximately 20 million square feet, concentrated in Washington, D.C. and Arlington, Virginia directly across the Potomac River in Crystal City, Pentagon City and Rosslyn. Our footprint is about twice the size of any of our peers. 
I want to start by contextualizing the Washington Metro market, in general. Currently, market demand is soft, but not as soft as many believe, as tenants await election results and clarity on the budget crisis. There is leasing activity in the market. In 2012, the gross leasing activity is expected to be about 32 million square feet, which is actually on par with the 15-year average. There is a lot of churn but not yet enough absorption to eat into vacancies, especially in this peak BRAC year. Through 3 quarters of this year, there was negative absorption of about 2.5 million square feet in the market. Rents are holding steady but concessions are up to attract tenants. Limited supply over the next several years will help to stabilize the market, but we don't really expect the market to gain significant traction until 2014. 
Within our Washington portfolio, our year-to-date leasing velocity has been brisk. Over 1.6 million square feet so far, well ahead of our projection for the full year. We are attracting good activity and consistently executing more than our fair share of deals at good risks. 
In fact, we have signed 6 new leases, each one of them over 50,000 square feet as compared to one new lease over 25,000 square feet in all of 2011. In the third quarter, specifically, we leased 435,000 square feet at very good average initial rents of $44.02 per square foot, and this is versus 389,000 square feet leased in the same quarter last year. The GAAP mark-to-market was 13.8%, and the cash mark-to-market was 8.9%. Of the total 435,000 square feet leased this quarter, government leases accounted for 170,000 square feet and the private sector leased 265,000 square feet. So despite a slow leasing environment in Washington, we continue to win business. 
To start off the fourth quarter, we just executed a lease for 108,000 square feet to the Corporate Executive Board in one of our buildings that is about to be renovated in  Rosslyn. With this lease, we have now resolved 871,000 square feet, or roughly 36%, of the 2.4 million square feet of Department of Defense lease expirations resulting from BRAC. This includes our plan to demolish the existing 350,000 square foot 1851 South Bell building to rebuild a new state-of-the-art 700,000 square foot office tower at 1900 Crystal Drive. We received final, full approvals from Arlington County for this project in September. Almost all of the BRAC relocations have now taken place and we are looking ahead. 
In our 20 million-square-foot portfolio, lease expirations in 2013 are below our average, with a very manageable 940,000 square feet expiring. Re-leasing the remainder of the BRAC space is a function of time and we will emerge stronger when complete. We had a similar experience in 2004 and 2005 when the Patent and Trademark Office relocated, but in the end, we benefited by re-leasing to a more diverse population of tenants and by increasing rents by over 30%. We are confident the same will be true this time, too. 
For the entire Washington DC division, same-store EBITDA for the quarter was down 6.9% on a GAAP basis and 9.2% on a cash basis due to BRAC. Overall occupancy is 84%. 
Our residential portfolio, which consists of 2,424 units in Arlington and D.C., representing approximately 12% of the business, is over 97% occupied and had a quarterly same-store EBITDA increase of 8.5%. And finally, we are delighted to welcome Nike to Georgetown with the opening last week of their new flagship 31,000 square foot store at our 3040 M Street property. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mike. Thank you."

I wanted to cover a few things of retail -- non-New York City retail in the Mart, and talk a minute about sustainability. Our retail strips and mall team continue to perform. In the quarter, we had an 8.8% GAAP mark-to-market and occupancy was 93.4%. While the shakeouts in supermarket industry and the closings and downsizings associated with Best Buy and others are a concern, this nationwide trend is less important to us because of the concentration of assets we have in the densely populated, high barrier to entry, affluent tri-state area. Our Mart segment is much smaller and leaner now and the numbers show it. Occupancy is up 11.6% to 94.2% as a result of the Motorola Mobility-Google lease and EBITDA improved by $1.1 million to $13.7 million. The commitment of Motorola Mobility-Google at the Merchandise Mart is having the positive ripple effect we thought it would have. We also benefited from restacking the showroom tenants in the building in a very efficient way. 
Let's talk sustainability for a minute. We've been working very hard on this front. Our commitment to sustainability is highlighted in our annual sustainability report available on our website and reprinted in Steve's chairman letter. We think sustainability is not only good business, that it's morally responsible and works to increase our profits in the end. Most recently, we are proud to have ranked #1 in Newsweek's Green Rankings of our entire industry, and we were 87th among America's 500 largest publicly-traded companies and 500 largest companies internationally. That's quite an achievement. 
By the end of 2012, we will have LEED-certified over 30 million feet in our portfolio, more than any other single owner nationwide. We are a leader in energy management and sub-metering, and our efforts have resulted in significant reduction in  energy consumption throughout our portfolio.
In summary, we are very excited about the future of our great assets and businesses, which are run by a very talented management team. We will continue to make Vornado a simpler company, improving the portfolio and recycle capital and increase asset quality. I'd like to turn it over to Joe Mac now for the financial review."
312648,222888286,378329,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quart",642,"Thank you, Michael. Yesterday, we reported comparable funds from operations of $1.14 per share versus $1.13 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Total funds from operations was $1.34 per share versus $1.05 per share in the prior year's third quarter. First Call was $1.17 per share as some analysts factor in noncomparable items into their estimates and others do not. 
Our noncomparable items in this quarter consisted of a $19.7 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Canadian Trade Shows, $12.5 million of FFO from discontinued operations, an $11.7 million gain on redemption of preferred units, $4.3 million of income from the mark-to-market of the JCPenney derivative position, partially offset by a $7 million Verde impairment and other costs. 
As Mike indicated, we announced the sale of Green Acres Mall for $500 million to the Macerich Company. Net proceeds from the sale will be $185 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. The gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $195 million. The tax gain will be approximately $304 million and is expected to be deferred as part of a like-kind exchange. The Green Acres sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and is conditioned on the closing of the King's Plaza Mall. 
Alexander's, our 32.4% owned affiliate, also announced the sale of King's Plaza Mall for $751 million to Macerich. Net proceeds to Alexander's from this sale will be $481 million after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. Alexander's gain for financial statement purposes will be approximately $603 million, of which Vornado's 32.4% share will be approximately $181 million, after adjusting for certain acquisition costs in Alexander's stock. Alexander's tax gain will be approximately $625 million, which is expected to be paid out to shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend this year. Vornado's share of the dividend is approximately $202 million or $1.02 per Vornado share and is also expected to be paid out this year to Vornado shareholders as a special long-term capital gain dividend. The King's Plaza sale is expected to be completed this quarter. 
We have over $2.7 billion of liquidity at September 30. Our consolidated debt-to-enterprise value was 36.8% and our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 6.6x. 
In capital market transactions this quarter, we issued $300 million of 5.7% preferred shares and redeemed $255 million of preferred shares and preferred units, with a weighted average dividend cost of 6.9%. This results in $3.1 million lower annual dividend cost to us and the $11.7 million gain in noncomparable items I just mentioned. 
We refinanced 2 properties for aggregate proceeds of $248 million with a weighted average term of 10 years, which resulted in $49 million of net proceeds. The weighted average interest rate of the new loans is 3.3% compared to 2.3% weighted average interest rate on the maturing loans. That's as a result of going from floating rate to fixed rate on one of those loans in the amount of $150 million. Now the new loan has a 12-year term, fixed rate. 
We also unencumbered 2 properties by repaying $151 million outstanding balance on the mortgage loans, which added a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Of course, the source of that was our overnight cash balances, which earned 0. 
Importantly, we expect to complete the refinancing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas in the fourth quarter in a single asset CMBS for close to $1 billion, replacing the $409 million mortgage that now exists on the property and with a much lower interest rate. We also expect to finance the acquisition of 656 Fifth Avenue retail with a $390 million mortgage. We are highly confident that the $721 million of remaining 2013 maturities will be refinanced at favorable rates as well. At this time, I'd like to turn it over for Q&A."

As I said earlier, on upper Fifth Avenue, we've really seen rents approaching $3,000 a foot and that was in fact validated with the deal that we did at 689 Fifth Avenue with Mac earlier this year. And again on Madison Avenue, we've seen extraordinary strengths in the market. We have closed a number of deals at 11 East 68th Street, again, at rents at and above $1,000 a foot. I think as you look at some of the sales numbers, I guess the comment I'll make is, Times Square is an extraordinary market because it's almost a 24/7 market.

So we expect these markets to be very good long-term. They won't be straight line up.

We look at the overall return we could create over a period of time and sometimes we're buying well below market leases that would justify a much lower cap rate that we could turn in a period of years into a much higher yield. So the 5.2% doesn't really relate to the overall cost of capital of 8%, it's really what the asset can perform and generate over a period of time. So whether it's the Marriott deal, or whether it's another deal, we look at that over a period of a holding period, which would be as long as 5 to 10 years, or longer, and then that has to meet the -- that clear that hurdle of our cost of capital."

We're certainly going to sell assets, and if we found great acquisitions we would proceed with those. We've been focusing on the core markets that we're in. We're are focusing on the street retail in New York, as David mentioned before. Particularly for value-added opportunities that may come with some re-leasing down the road or redevelopment down the road. Marriott is a good example of that. There's a process to go through, adding additional space, really working that asset over a period of time to try to create, as Joe mentioned, the 5.2% existing income going substantially up. So street retail in New York with value-added components is particularly a focus. We are looking to get a lot of office buildings. I think there's an escalating volume of office deals coming to the market as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, bigger deals that might provide some opportunity. Obviously, if there's a lease rollover in some of those that will take place down the road, that could affect the, obviously, pricing, could affect the return potential. So in D.C., we haven't seen much distress in asset sales despite what a negatively viewed market. [indiscernible] We've obviously been a net seller in D.C. And we look at all these markets to try to find a deal that fits our parameters, Michael.  So I would say the acquisition market is not easier to find deals right now, that meet that criteria because there's more money and more demand for it than I think the deals' volume right now suggests.
