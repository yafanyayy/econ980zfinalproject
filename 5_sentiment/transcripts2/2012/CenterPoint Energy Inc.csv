279513,145850848,266905,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2012",2012-02-29,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and fin",1641,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and financially. We resolved the long standing issues associated with our 2004 true-up proceedings. And last month, we covered almost $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs through the issuance of securitization bonds. We're pleased this matter is finally behind us and we can now focus our full attention on the future. 
This morning, we reported full year earnings of $1.36 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of the true-up proceedings, net income would have been $546 million or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $442 million or $1.7 per diluted share in 2010. So this was an outstanding year either way you look at it. 
Our fourth quarter results were also solid. Net income was $117 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $124 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter earnings for 2011, on the same basis as we provide earnings guidance, would have been $0.26 per diluted share. This was above our expectations due principally due to a lower effective tax rate associated with state income taxes. Our press release and 10-K provide the details around our financial results this past year. So I won't repeat the specifics. 
I will however, summarize the performance of each unit and describe their prospects for 2012 and beyond. Houston Electric had its best year financially. Core operating income was $496 million compared to $427 million in 2010. Fourth quarter income was $62 million, up $6 million from 2010. Last summer's record heat was the biggest driver of Houston Electric's increased income. 
In addition, we saw a strong growth in Houston with over 45,000 new customers added last year. Our gas LDCs also had a good year. Operating income for the full year was $226 million or about $5 million below the record level of 2010. Fourth quarter income was $73 million compared to $86 million in 2010. While margin growth was modest last year, we were successful in our expense management efforts. As results on an overall basis, we earned at or near our authorized greater return for the second consecutive year. 
Our Interstate Pipelines achieved operating income of $248 million last year down from the $270 million in 2010. Income in the fourth quarter was $52 million compared to $63 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were almost completely attributable to the exploration of a backhaul contract on our Carthage to Perryville line. 
Our Field Services units had a very strong year. As a result of the investments we've made to gather and treat gas in several developing shale place. Full year operating income was $189 million, compared to $151 million the previous year. Fourth quarter earnings were $53 million compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is worth noting that operating income for 2010 reflected a gain of $21 million from the sale of some nonstrategic assets. Excluding that onetime gain, last year's fourth quarter earnings were up over 45% from 2010. 
Our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business continued to struggle in 2011. Full year earnings were $6 million compared to $16 million in 2010. Fourth quarter earnings were $3 million compared to no operating income in the previous year. For the past 2 years, this unit has been burdened with uneconomic pipeline capacity contracts. However, we were able to accelerate the termination of some of those contracts last year, and most of the remaining uneconomic contracts will expire over the next 12 months. 
Now let me turn to the future and give you some insights into each business units' prospects. Year in, year out, Houston Electric has been able to earn its regulated rate of return since we formed CenterPoint Energy in 2002. I expect that it will perform well this year. It has a solid and growing service territory. The Houston metropolitan area was the first area in the nation to replace the jobs lost during the economic downturn, and more than 80,000 jobs are expected to be created this year. We estimate that customer growth will equal or exceed the growth we experienced last year, which should add approximately $25 million in base revenues. However, Houston Electric is unlikely to equal its 2011 financial performance, which I -- as I indicated earlier was driven by record heat. This unusual weather added approximately $60 million to base revenues last year. 
In addition, the negative impact of the rates implemented in September of last year will be experienced for the full year in 2012. We expect this to be approximately -- estimate this to be approximately $35 million. Over the longer term, Houston Electric should experienced significant rate base growth. Annual capital expenditures are forecast to average between $500 million and $550 million over the next 5 years, resulting in annual rate base growth of over 4%. Because of the recently approved distribution cost recovery factor, together with the long-standing transmission cost recovery mechanism, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. We anticipate rate-based growth at our gas LDCs as well. Over the next 5 years, capital expenditures are expected to exceed $350 million a year, compared to an historical run rate of about $200 million a year. This increase expenditures are primarily related to new pipeline integrity and safety requirements, and will result in an annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Although, we had rate adjustment mechanisms in most jurisdictions, we will likely need to file a number of rate cases over the next 12 to 18 months. While the current low natural gas prices are positive for both Houston Electric and our gas LDC's, they can negatively affect our midstream business. This is particularly true for our Field Services unit. As we've indicated in the past, we retained over 1.5% of all gas we gather. While the majority of our revenue stream is fee based, we do our revenues from the sale of this retain gas. We estimate that each $1 change in natural gas prices will have about $20 million impact on operating income this year. 
In addition, as gas prices are following, rig activity in dry gas basins has also decline. This is most significant in our traditional gathering area, where we've seen some gathering volumes have decline over 10% since 2010. Increasing gathering volumes in the shale place however, have more than offset this decline. Overall, gathering volumes increased almost 30% last year and by year end, we were gathering about 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. We expect total gathering volume under our current contracts will increase about 15% to 20% this year. 
Low natural gas prices and compressed basis differential are also expected to impact our Interstate Pipelines. It is unlikely any significant pipelines will be needed in the near term in our current Mid-Continent footprint, and there will be increased competition for new and existing customers. 
In addition, the exploration of a backhaul agreement last year, will reduce operating income by approximately $10 million this year. However, we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines particularly power generation customers. Over the last few years our Energy Services business has suffered like many others in the industry. As I indicated earlier, the principal drag on earnings has been related to uneconomic pipelines capacity agreements. We've taken actions to reduce our exposure to such agreements by an estimated $15 million this year. 
Our retail business continues to do well and we expect 2012 would be a year of significant improvement for this business. Of course, we also expect to realize earnings benefits from the $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs we recovered last month. Earlier this year, we called or tendered for our $375 million of debt at the parent company. Gary will provide the details and earnings impact for this debt reduction in a few minutes. 
As we indicated in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to invest the remaining proceeds in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. Well we are not in a position to make any announcements today, I feel confident we will be successful in deploying a portion of this proceeds to expand our present businesses, and we are currently evaluating several possibilities particularly in the Field Services sector. 
As I indicated earlier, we will also be required to make significant new capital investments in our existing regulated businesses to satisfy both growth and regulatory requirements. I'd like to remind you of the $20.25 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 19. This marks the 7th consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continued to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to our employees, through who's hard work we achieved not only an outstanding 2011, but excellent operating and financial performance since our inception in 2002. As many of you know, we face some significant challenges in our early years. But I think we are stronger today because of our success in overcoming them and I'm convinced our future is even brighter. We have terrific employees, well-positioned assets and business units and a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can excel under a variety of market conditions. 
Thank you again for your interest in the company. I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable resolution of the true-up case last year, the rating agencies have taken positive actions to upgrade the long-term ratings of the debt of Energy, CE and Serk. Each company now has a solid investment grade credit ratings and the ratings outlook for each company is either stable or positive. 
In addition, our business has generated solid cash flows and when combined with the benefits of bonus depreciation, essentially funded our capital program and dividend in 2011. We ended 2011 with net debt of approximately $6.7 billion and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 61.2%. 
In January of this year, we closes on the sale of approximately $1.7 billion in transition bond with an effective annual weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.5%. We were very pleased with this offering, which resulted in one of the lowest rate of any utility securitization. The company received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the offering. 
Our solid balance sheet, cash on hand, internally generated cash and other liquidity provides the company with a financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. I know you are all interested in how we are currently using the cash we received from the sale of the transition bond. First, we use a portion of the cash to payoff outstanding commercial paper. In addition, as we continue to evaluate the number of opportunities to invest the cash in long-term accretive projects, we made the decision to reacquire cash debt at parent the company having an aggregate principal amount of the $375 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. As this clearly enhances earnings and cash flow relative to the alternative of maintaining cash and money market funds earning approximately 20 basis points. The result will be a reduction in interest expense in 2012 of approximately $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This action supports our long-standing objective of deleveraging the parent company. 
As David pointed out, we have a significant capital plan for 2012. We estimate our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million from 2011. About 86% or a little more than $1.1 billion of CapEx will be sent by our regulated businesses this year compared to 78% in 2011. 
Let me give you a breakdown by business. In our Electric business, we expect to spend $575 million, an increase of $37 million or 7% from 2011. CapEx will be used primarily to support our investments in infrastructure to serve new loads and enhance reliability. We expect to spend $354 million in our natural gas distribution business reflecting a 20% increase or $59 million from 2011. This increased level of spending will be used primarily for infrastructure related to pipeline safety and integrity. 
Our pipeline capital budget is $181 million, which is significantly more than our 2011 spend of $98 million. This increase will be used primarily for routine maintenance, major line replacements related to pipeline safety and integrity, as well as spending a certain with meeting anticipated new regulatory requirements. 
For the completion of our Magnolia and Olympia systems, our 2012 capital budget for Field Services is $139 million. However, this does not include any new new capital which may be required if we were to add significant new opportunities. To the extent we need financing in connection with future growth opportunities, we expect we can finance them an attractive interest rates at the operating company level. However, we are often asked about our financing strategy for our midstream business especially whether or not we are considering the formation of an MLP. We continue to think the formation of an MLP can be an efficient structure to finance significant new growth and thus remains a viable option for our company as we evaluate various midstream projects. 
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2011 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $1.8 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is somewhat broader guidance range -- this somewhat broader guidance range, takes into consideration a number of economic and operational variables that may impact our actual earnings performance. Although the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the Texas economy in particular, can have a significant impact to earnings. But most important variables are commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. 
We have developed our guidance range by using combination of these variables. We have also taken into account the benefit of the $375 million debt reduction at the parent, and we are using an average share count of approximately 430 million shares. In addition, we have not assumed any additional use of the remaining true-up proceeds in developing this range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mariaane."

We've seen that the traditional basins decline in the fourth quarter more than it did in any other time during the year. You might recall, the first 3 quarters were pretty flat, but we saw a decline in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that that's going to be sustainable, but there's not a lot of rig activity in those dry gas basins at this gas prices. So year-to-year in our traditional basins, we saw about a 10% maybe a little bit more drop in traditional basins gathering. Of course, offsetting all that is the Haynesville gathering, we're doing in Magnolia and Olympia. Fayetteville gathering continues to increase. We've got some wet gas in our traditional basins and that's kind of helping us to because there is some drilling in these basins that weathers wet gas. So it turns out, we had an excellent year from a gathering standpoint ending at $2.6 billion a day, which was up 25%, up 30% from 2010. You have to attribute that to all of this substantial shale place and the new investments we make."

I will tell you that current weather forecast are suggesting it's going to be hot and dry again. So it's not out of the question. But our model suggests we got almost $60 million from normal weather in 2011. So we'll just have to wait to see what happens there. Our growth in customers should add at least $25 million. We've got transmission revenues of another $10 million that should benefit 2012. And we saw some customer actually usage growth in 2011. We're not sure whether that was real usage or whether it was weather. It was so hot it was hard to distinguish it. So there could be a little upside there as well. And then we have the full year the rate case, which might kind of offset the rates I talked about. I think we are going to have a good year. I think we can earn our regulatory return next year. But unless we get this hot weather, we probably won't set the same kind of records we did in in 2011. But I would also say pipeline, it does have a little bit of headwind there because we have that -- the tail end of that backhaul agreement that we didn't feel in the first 4, 5 months of last year, we're going to feel this year and we estimate that about $10 million impact. As you might -- I'm sure you know, there's a lot of pipes in the Mid-Continent area they're going to be competing with us as we contract roll off. And we tend to believe that that could put a little pressure on rates. But having said that, each year we have been able to overcome a lot of the things. So I'm not ready to say that the pipeline is not going to have good year. But they have a low headwind in front of them and that's for sure. Field Services real depend on gas prices. I think they should have a good year whether it's not going to the 30% to 40% increase we saw in 2011 now."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and fin",1645,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and financially. We resolved the long standing issues associated with our 2004 true-up proceeding. And last month, we covered almost $1.7 billion of additional true-up cost through the issuance of securitization bonds. We're pleased this matter is finally behind us and we can now focus our full attention on the future. 
This morning, we reported full year earnings of $1.36 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of the true-up proceeding, net income would have been $546 million or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $442 million or $1.7 per diluted share in 2010. So this was an outstanding year either way you look at it. 
Our fourth quarter results were also solid. Net income was $117 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $124 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter earnings for 2011, on the same basis as we provide earnings guidance, would have been $0.26 per diluted share. This was above our expectations due principally to a lower effective tax rate associated with state income taxes. Our press release and 10-K provide the details around our financial results this past year. So I won't repeat the specifics. 
I will however, summarize the performance of each unit and describe their prospects for 2012 and beyond. Houston Electric had its best year financially. Core operating income was $496 million compared to $427 million in 2010. Fourth quarter income was $62 million, up $6 million from 2010. Last summer's record heat was the biggest driver of Houston Electric's increased income. 
In addition, we saw a strong growth in Houston with over 45,000 new customers added last year. Our gas LDCs also had a good year. Operating income for the full year was $226 million or about $5 million below the record level of 2010. Fourth quarter income was $73 million compared to $86 million in 2010. While margin growth was modest last year, we were successful in our expense management efforts. As a result, on an overall basis, we earned at or near our authorized rate of return for the second consecutive year. 
Our Interstate Pipelines achieved operating income of $248 million last year down from the $270 million in 2010. Income in the fourth quarter was $52 million compared to $63 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were almost completely attributable to the exploration of a backhaul contract on our Carthage to Perryville line. 
Our Field Services unit had a very strong year. As a result of the investments we've made to gather and treat gas in several developing shale place. Full year operating income was $189 million, compared to $151 million the previous year. Fourth quarter earnings were $53 million compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is worth noting that operating income for 2010 reflected a gain of $21 million from the sale of some nonstrategic assets. Excluding that onetime gain, last year's fourth quarter earnings were up over 45% from 2010. 
Our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business continued to struggle in 2011. Full year earnings were $6 million compared to $16 million in 2010. Fourth quarter earnings were $3 million compared to no operating income in the previous year. For the past 2 years, this unit has been burdened with uneconomic pipeline capacity contracts. However, we were able to accelerate the termination of some of those contracts last year, and most of the remaining uneconomic contracts will expire over the next 12 months. 
Now let me turn to the future and give you some insight into each business units' prospects. Year in, year out, Houston Electric has been able to earn its regulated rate of return since we formed CenterPoint Energy in 2002. I expect that it will perform well this year. It has a solid and growing service territory. The Houston metropolitan area was the first area in the nation to replace the jobs lost during the economic downturn, and more than 80,000 jobs are expected to be created this year. We estimate that customer growth will equal or exceed the growth we experienced last year, which should add approximately $25 million in base revenues. However, Houston Electric is unlikely to equal its 2011 financial performance, which I -- as I indicated earlier was driven by record heat. This unusual weather added approximately $60 million to base revenues last year. 
In addition, the negative impact of the rates implemented in September of last year will be experienced for the full year in 2012. We expect this to be approximately -- estimate this to be approximately $35 million. Over the longer term, Houston Electric should experience significant rate base growth. Annual capital expenditures are forecast to average between $500 million and $550 million over the next 5 years, resulting in annual rate base growth of over 4%. Because of the recently approved distribution cost recovery factor, together with the long-standing transmission cost recovery mechanism, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. We anticipate rate-based growth at our gas LDCs as well. Over the next 5 years, capital expenditures are expected to exceed $350 million a year, compared to an historical run rate of about $200 million a year. This increase expenditures are primarily related to new pipeline integrity and safety requirements, and will result in an annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Although, we have rate adjustment mechanisms in most jurisdictions, we will likely need to file a number of rate cases over the next 12 to 18 months. While the current low natural gas prices are positive for both Houston Electric and our gas LDCs, they can negatively affect our Midstream business. This is particularly true for our Field Services unit. As we've indicated in the past, we retained over 1.5% of all gas we gather. While the majority of our revenue stream is fee based, we do earn revenues from the sale of this retained gas. We estimate that each $1 change in natural gas prices will have about $20 million impact on operating income this year. 
In addition, as gas prices are following, rig activity in dry gas basins has also decline. This is most significant in our traditional gathering area, where we've seen some gathering volumes decline over 10% since 2010. Increasing gathering volumes in the shale place however, probably more than offset this decline. Overall, gathering volumes increased almost 30% last year and by year end, we were gathering about 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. We expect total gathering volume under our current contracts will increase about 15% to 20% this year. 
Low natural gas prices and compressed basis differential are also expected to impact our Interstate Pipelines. It is unlikely any significant new pipelines will be needed in the near term in our current Mid-Continent footprint, and there will be increased competition for new and existing customers. 
In addition, the exploration of a backhaul agreement last year, will reduce operating income by approximately $10 million this year. we -- however we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines particularly power generation customers. Over the last few years our Energy Services business has suffered like many others in the industry. As I indicated earlier, the principal drag on earnings has been related to uneconomic pipeline capacity agreements. We've taken actions to reduce our exposure to such agreements by an estimated $15 million this year. 
Our retail business continues to do well and we expect 2012 would be a year of significant improvement for this business. Of course, we also expect to realize earnings benefits from the $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs we recovered last month. Earlier this year, we called or tendered for our $375 million of debt at the parent company. Gary will provide the details and earnings impact for this debt reduction in a few minutes. 
As we indicated in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to invest the remaining proceeds in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. While we are not in a position to make any announcements today, I feel confident we will be successful in deploying a portion of this proceeds to expand our present businesses, and we are currently evaluating several possibilities particularly in the Field Services sector. 
As I indicated earlier, we will also be required to make significant new capital investments in our existing regulated businesses to satisfy both growth and regulatory requirements. I'd like to remind you of the $20.25 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 19. This marks the 7th consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to our employees, through who's hard work we achieved not only an outstanding 2011, but excellent operating and financial performance since our inception in 2002. As many of you know, we face some significant challenges in our early years. But I think we are stronger today because of our success in overcoming them and I'm convinced our future is even brighter. We have terrific employees, well-positioned assets and business units and a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can excel under a variety of market conditions. 
Thank you again for your interest in the company. I will now turn the call over to Gary."

First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable resolution of the true-up case last year, the rating agencies have taken positive actions to upgrade the long-term ratings of the debt of CenterPoit Energy, CE and CERC. Each company now has a solid investment grade credit ratings and the ratings outlook for each company is either stable or positive. 
In addition, our business has generated solid cash flows and when combined with the benefits of bonus depreciation, essentially funded our capital program and dividend in 2011. We ended 2011 with net debt of approximately $6.7 billion and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 61.2%. 
In January of this year, we closed on the sale of approximately $1.7 billion in transition bond with an effective annual weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.5%. We were very pleased with this offering, which resulted in one of the lowest rate of any utility securitization. The company received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the offering. 
Our solid balance sheet, cash on hand, internally generated cash and other liquidity provide the company with the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. I know you are all interested in how we are currently using the cash we received from the sale of the transition bond. First, we used a portion of the cash to payoff outstanding commercial paper. In addition, as we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest the cash in long-term accretive projects, we made the decision to reacquire cash exempt debt at the parent company having an aggregate principal amount of $375 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. As this clearly enhances earnings and cash flow relative to the alternative of maintaining cash and money market fund earning approximately 20 basis points. The result will be a reduction in Interest Expense in 2012 of approximately $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This action supports our long-standing objective of deleveraging the parent company. 
As David pointed out, we have a significant capital plan for 2012. We estimate our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million from 2011. About 86% or a little more than $1.1 billion of CapEx will be sent by our regulated businesses this year compared to 78% in 2011. 
Let me give you a breakdown by business. In our Electric business, we expect to spend $575 million, an increase of $37 million or 7% from 2011. CapEx will be used primarily to support our investments in infrastructure to serve new load and enhance reliability. We expect to spend $354 million in our natural gas distribution business reflecting a 20% increase or $59 million from 2011. This increased level of spending will be used primarily for infrastructure related to pipeline safety and integrity. 
Our pipeline capital budget is $181 million, which is significantly more than our 2011 spend of $98 million. This increase will be used primarily for routine maintenance, major line replacements related to pipeline safety and integrity, as well as spending a [indiscernible] meeting anticipated new regulatory requirement. 
For the completion of our Magnolia and Olympia systems, our 2012 capital budget for Field Services is $139 million. However, the assessment does not include any new capital which may be required if we were to add significant new opportunities. To the extent we need financing in connection with future growth opportunity, we expect we can finance them an attractive interest rates at the operating company level. However, we are often asked about our financing strategy for our Midstream business especially whether or not we are considering the formation of an MLP. We continue to think the formation of an MLP can be an efficient structure to finance significant new growth and thus remains a viable option for our company as we evaluate various Midstream projects. 
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $1.8 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is somewhat broader guidance range -- this is somewhat broader guidance range, takes into consideration a number of economic and operational variables that may impact our actual earnings performance. Although the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the Texas economy in particular, can have a significant impact to earnings. The most important variables are commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. 
We have developed our guidance range by using combinations of these variables. We have also taken into account the benefit of the $375 million debt reduction at the parent, and we are using an average share count of approximately 430 million shares. In addition, we have not assumed any additional use of the remaining true-up proceed in developing this range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mariaane."

But we were gathering in total about $2.6 billion at the end of last year. I would say out of our traditional basins, that's more like 750 to 775 something of that nature. We've seen that the traditional basins declined in the fourth quarter more than it did in any other time during the year. As you might recall, the first 3 quarters were pretty flat, but we saw a decline in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that's going to be sustainable, but there's not a lot of rig activity in those dry gas basins at these gas prices. So year-to-year in our traditional basins, we saw about a 10% maybe a little bit more drop in traditional basins gathering. Of course, offsetting all that is the Haynesville gathering, we're doing in Magnolia and Olympia. Fayetteville gathering continues to increase. We've got some wet gas in our traditional basins and that's kind of helping us too because there are -- there is some drilling in these basins that -- where there's wet gas. So it turns out, we had an excellent year from a gathering standpoint ending at $2.6 billion a day, which was up, I don't know, 25%, up 30% from 2010. You have to attribute that to all of these, I mean, substantial shale plays and the new investments we made."

I will tell you that current weather forecasts are suggesting it's going to be hot and dry again. So it's not out of the question. But our model suggests we got almost $60 million from normal weather at -- in 2011. So we'll just have to wait to see what happens there. Our growth in customers should add at least $25 million. We've got transmission revenues of another $10 million that should benefit 2012. And we've -- we saw some customer actual usage growth in 2011. We're not sure whether that was real usage or whether it was weather. It was so hot it was hard to distinguish yet. So it could be a little upside there as well. And then we have the full year of the rate case, which might kind of offset some of the things I've talked about. So we think we are going to have a good year. We think we can earn our regulator rate of return next year. But unless we get this hot weather, we probably won't set the same kind of records we did in 2011. I would also say pipelines, it does have a little bit of headwind there because we have that -- the tail end of that backhaul agreement that we didn't feel in the first 4, 5 months of last year, we're going to feel it this year and we estimate that's about $10 million impact. As you might -- I'm sure you know, there's lots of pipes in the Midcontinent area they're going to -- they're competing with us as we -- as contracts roll off. And we tend to believe that, that could put a little pressure on rates. But having said that, each year we've been able to overcome a lot of these things. So I'm not ready to say that pipeline is not going to have good year. But they have a low headwind in front of them and that's for sure. Field Services, it really depends on gas prices.

Should we basically just take that as kind of that number divided by the 10-year average life and that's what is going to be the EPS impact if you will on an annual basis from that? And where does that show up?"

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and fin",1643,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and financially. We resolved the long standing issues associated with our 2004 true-up proceeding. And last month, we covered almost $1.7 billion of additional true-up cost through the issuance of securitization bonds. We're pleased this matter is finally behind us and we can now focus our full attention on the future. 
This morning, we reported full year earnings of $1.36 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of the true-up proceeding, net income would have been $546 million or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $442 million or $1.7 per diluted share in 2010. So this was an outstanding year either way you look at it. 
Our fourth quarter results were also solid. Net income was $117 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $124 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter earnings for 2011, on the same basis as we provide earnings guidance, would have been $0.26 per diluted share. This was above our expectations due principally to a lower effective tax rate associated with state income taxes. Our press release and 10-K provide the details around our financial results this past year. So I won't repeat the specifics. 
I will however, summarize the performance of each unit and describe their prospects for 2012 and beyond. Houston Electric had its best year financially. Core operating income was $496 million compared to $427 million in 2010. Fourth quarter income was $62 million, up $6 million from 2010. Last summer's record heat was the biggest driver of Houston Electric's increased income. 
In addition, we saw strong growth in Houston with over 45,000 new customers added last year. Our gas LDCs also had a good year. Operating income for the full year was $226 million or about $5 million below the record level of 2010. Fourth quarter income was $73 million compared to $86 million in 2010. While margin growth was modest last year, we were successful in our expense management efforts. As a result, on an overall basis, we earned at or near our authorized rate of return for the second consecutive year. 
Our Interstate Pipelines achieved operating income of $248 million last year down from the $270 million in 2010. Income in the fourth quarter was $52 million compared to $63 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were almost completely attributable to the exploration of a backhaul contract on our Carthage to Perryville line. 
Our Field Services unit had a very strong year. As a result of the investments we've made to gather and treat gas in several developing shale plays. Full year operating income was $189 million, compared to $151 million the previous year. Fourth quarter earnings were $53 million compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is worth noting that operating income for 2010 reflected a gain of $21 million from the sale of some nonstrategic assets. Excluding that onetime gain, last year's fourth quarter earnings were up over 45% from 2010. 
Our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business continued to struggle in 2011. Full year earnings were $6 million compared to $16 million in 2010. Fourth quarter earnings were $3 million compared to no operating income in the previous year. For the past 2 years, this unit has been burdened with uneconomic pipeline capacity contracts. However, we were able to accelerate the termination of some of those contracts last year, and most of the remaining uneconomic contracts will expire over the next 12 months. 
Now let me turn to the future and give you some insight into each business units' prospects. Year in, year out, Houston Electric has been able to earn its regulated rate of return since we formed CenterPoint Energy in 2002. I expect that it will perform well this year. It has a solid and growing service territory. The Houston metropolitan area was the first area in the nation to replace the jobs lost during the economic downturn, and more than 80,000 jobs are expected to be created this year. We estimate that customer growth will equal or exceed the growth we experienced last year, which should add approximately $25 million in base revenues. However, Houston Electric is unlikely to equal its 2011 financial performance, which I -- as I indicated earlier was driven by record heat. This unusual weather added approximately $60 million to base revenues last year. 
In addition, the negative impact of the rates implemented in September of last year will be experienced for the full year in 2012. We expect this to be approximately -- estimate this to be approximately $35 million. Over the longer term, Houston Electric should experience significant rate base growth. Annual capital expenditures are forecast to average between $500 million and $550 million over the next 5 years, resulting in annual rate base growth of over 4%. Because of the recently approved distribution cost recovery factor, together with the long-standing transmission cost recovery mechanism, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. We anticipate rate-based growth at our gas LDCs as well. Over the next 5 years, capital expenditures are expected to exceed $350 million a year, compared to an historical run rate of about $200 million a year. These  increased expenditures are primarily related to new pipeline integrity and safety requirements, and will result in an annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Although we have rate adjustment mechanisms in most jurisdictions, we will likely need to file a number of rate cases over the next 12 to 18 months. While the current low natural gas prices are positive for both Houston Electric and our gas LDCs, they can negatively affect our Midstream business. This is particularly true for our Field Services unit. As we've indicated in the past, we retained over 1.5% of all gas we gather. While the majority of our revenue stream is fee based, we do earn revenues from the sale of this retained gas. We estimate that each $1 change in natural gas prices will have about a $20 million impact on operating income this year. 
In addition, as gas prices have fallen, rig activity in dry gas basins has also declined. This is most significant in our traditional gathering area, where we've seen some gathering volumes decline over 10% since 2010. Increasing gathering volumes in the shale plays  however, have more than offset this decline. Overall, gathering volumes increased almost 30% last year and by year end we were gathering about 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. We expect total gathering volumes under our current contracts will increase about 15% to 20% this year. 
Low natural gas prices in compressed basis differentials are also expected to impact our Interstate Pipelines. It is unlikely any significant new pipelines will be needed in the near term in our current Mid-Continent footprint, and there will be increased competition for new and existing customers. 
In addition, the exploration of a backhaul agreement last year, will reduce operating income by approximately $10 million this year. However we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines particularly power generation customers. Over the last few years our Energy Services business has suffered like many others in the industry. As I indicated earlier, the principal drag on earnings has been related to uneconomic pipeline capacity agreements. We've taken actions to reduce our exposure to such agreements by an estimated $15 million this year. 
Our retail business continues to do well and we expect 2012 will be a year of significant improvement for this business. Of course, we also expect to realize earnings benefits from the $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs we recovered last month. Earlier this year, we called or tendered for our $375 million of debt at the parent company. Gary will provide the details and earnings impact from this debt reduction in a few minutes. 
As we indicated in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to invest the remaining proceeds in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. While we are not in a position to make any announcements today, I feel confident we will be successful in deploying a portion of these proceeds to expand our present businesses, and we are currently evaluating several possibilities particularly in the Field Services sector. 
As I indicated earlier, we will also be required to make significant new capital investments in our existing regulated businesses to satisfy both growth and regulatory requirements. I'd like to remind you of the $20.25 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 19. This marks the 7th consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to our employees, through whose hard work we achieved not only an outstanding 2011, but excellent operating and financial performance since our inception in 2002. As many of you know, we face some significant challenges in our early years. But I think we are stronger today because of our success in overcoming them and I'm convinced our future is even brighter. We have terrific employees, well-positioned assets and business units and a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can excel under a variety of market conditions. 
Thank you again for your interest in the company. I will now turn the call over to Gary."
279513,145850848,267276,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2012",2012-02-29,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable r",858,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable resolution of the true-up case last year, the rating agencies have taken positive actions to upgrade the long-term ratings of the debt of CenterPoint Energy, CE and CERC. Each company now has solid investment grade credit ratings and the ratings outlook for each company is either stable or positive. 
In addition, our business has generated solid cash flows and when combined with the benefits of bonus depreciation, essentially funded our capital program and dividend in 2011. We ended 2011 with net debt of approximately $6.7 billion and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 61.2%. 
In January of this year, we closed on the sale of approximately $1.7 billion in transition bonds with an effective annual weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.5%. We were very pleased with this offering, which resulted in one of the lowest rates of any utility securitization. The company received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the offering. 
Our solid balance sheet, cash on hand, internally generated cash and other liquidity provide the company with the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. I know you are all interested in how we are currently using the cash we received from the sale of the transition bond. First, we used a portion of the cash to payoff outstanding commercial paper. In addition, as we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest the cash in long-term accretive projects, we made the decision to reacquire cash exempt debt at the parent company having an aggregate principal amount of $375 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. As this clearly enhances earnings and cash flow relative to the alternative of maintaining cash and money market fund earning approximately 20 basis points. The result will be a reduction in Interest Expense in 2012 of approximately $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This action supports our long-standing objective of deleveraging the parent company. 
As David pointed out, we have a significant capital plan for 2012. We estimate our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million from 2011. About 86% or a little more than $1.1 billion of CapEx will be spent  by our regulated businesses this year compared to 78% in 2011. 
Let me give you a breakdown by business. In our Electric business, we expect to spend $575 million, an increase of $37 million or 7% from 2011. CapEx will be used primarily to support our investments in infrastructure to serve new load and enhance reliability. We expect to spend $354 million in our natural gas distribution business reflecting a 20% increase or $59 million from 2011. This increased level of spending will be used primarily for infrastructure related to pipeline safety and integrity. 
Our pipeline capital budget is $181 million, which is significantly more than our 2011 spend of $98 million. This increase will be used primarily for routine maintenance, major line replacements related to pipeline safety and integrity, as well as spending associated with meeting anticipated new regulatory requirement. 
For the completion of our Magnolia and Olympia systems, our 2012 capital budget for Field Services is $139 million.  However, this estimate does not include any new capital which may be required if we were to have significant new opportunities. To the extent we need financing in connection with future growth opportunity, we expect we can finance them at attractive interest rates at the operating company level. However, we are often asked about our financing strategy for our Midstream business especially whether or not we are considering the formation of an MLP. We continue to think the formation of an MLP can be an efficient structure to finance significant new growth and thus remains a viable option for our company as we evaluate various Midstream projects. 
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $1.8 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is a  somewhat broader guidance range, this somewhat broader guidance range takes into consideration a number of economic and operational variables that may impact our actual earnings performance. Although the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the Texas economy in particular, can have a significant impact to earnings. The most important variables are commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. 
We have developed our guidance range by using combinations of these variables. We have also taken into account the benefit of the $375 million debt reduction at the parent, and we are using an average share count of approximately 430 million shares. In addition, we have not assumed any additional use of the remaining true-up proceed in developing this range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

But we were gathering in total about $2.6 billion at the end of last year. I would say out of our traditional basins, that's more like 750 to 775, something of that nature. We've seen that the traditional basins declined in the fourth quarter more than it did in any other time during the year. As you might recall, the first 3 quarters were pretty flat, but we saw a decline in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that's going to be sustainable, but there's not a lot of rig activity in those dry gas basins at these gas prices. So year-to-year in our traditional basins, we saw about a 10% maybe a little bit more drop in traditional basins gathering. Of course, offsetting all that is the Haynesville gathering we're doing in Magnolia and Olympia. Fayetteville gathering continues to increase. We've got some wet gas in our traditional basins and that's kind of helping us too because there are -- there is some drilling in these basins that -- where there's wet gas. So it turns out, we had an excellent year from a gathering standpoint ending at $2.6 billion a day, which was up, I don't know, 25%, up 30% from 2010.

I will tell you that current weather forecasts are suggesting it's going to be hot and dry again. So it's not out of the question. But our model suggests we got almost $60 million from normal weather at -- in 2011. So we'll just have to wait to see what happens there. Our growth in customers should add at least $25 million. We've got transmission revenues of another $10 million that should benefit 2012. And we've -- we saw some customer actual usage growth in 2011. We're not sure whether that was real usage or whether it was weather. It was so hot it was hard to distinguish yet. So it could be a little upside there as well. And then we have the full year of the rate case, which might kind of offset some of the things I've talked about. So we think we are going to have a good year. We think we can earn our regulator rate of return next year. But unless we get this hot weather, we probably won't set the same kind of records we did in 2011. I would also say pipelines, it does have a little bit of headwind there because we have that -- the tail end of that backhaul agreement that we didn't feel in the first 4, 5 months of last year, we're going to feel it this year and we estimate that's about a $10 million impact. As you might -- I'm sure you know, there's lots of pipes in the Midcontinent area that are going to be competing with us as we -- as contracts roll off. And we tend to believe that, that could put a little pressure on rates. But having said that, each year we've been able to overcome a lot of these things. So I'm not ready to say that pipeline is not going to have a good year. But they have a little  headwind in front of them that's for sure. Our Field Services, it really depends on gas prices.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and fin",1643,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and financially. We resolved the long standing issues associated with our 2004 true-up proceeding. And last month, we covered almost $1.7 billion of additional true-up cost through the issuance of securitization bonds. We're pleased this matter is finally behind us and we can now focus our full attention on the future. 
This morning, we reported full year earnings of $1.36 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of the true-up proceeding, net income would have been $546 million or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $442 million or $1.7 per diluted share in 2010. So this was an outstanding year either way you look at it. 
Our fourth quarter results were also solid. Net income was $117 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $124 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter earnings for 2011, on the same basis as we provide earnings guidance, would have been $0.26 per diluted share. This was above our expectations due principally to a lower effective tax rate associated with state income taxes. Our press release and 10-K provide the details around our financial results this past year. So I won't repeat the specifics. 
I will however, summarize the performance of each unit and describe their prospects for 2012 and beyond. Houston Electric had its best year financially. Core operating income was $496 million compared to $427 million in 2010. Fourth quarter income was $62 million, up $6 million from 2010. Last summer's record heat was the biggest driver of Houston Electric's increased income. 
In addition, we saw strong growth in Houston with over 45,000 new customers added last year. Our gas LDCs also had a good year. Operating income for the full year was $226 million or about $5 million below the record level of 2010. Fourth quarter income was $73 million compared to $86 million in 2010. While margin growth was modest last year, we were successful in our expense management efforts. As a result, on an overall basis, we earned at or near our authorized rate of return for the second consecutive year. 
Our Interstate Pipelines achieved operating income of $248 million last year down from the $270 million in 2010. Income in the fourth quarter was $52 million compared to $63 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were almost completely attributable to the exploration of a backhaul contract on our Carthage to Perryville line. 
Our Field Services unit had a very strong year. As a result of the investments we've made to gather and treat gas in several developing shale plays. Full year operating income was $189 million, compared to $151 million the previous year. Fourth quarter earnings were $53 million compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is worth noting that operating income for 2010 reflected a gain of $21 million from the sale of some nonstrategic assets. Excluding that onetime gain, last year's fourth quarter earnings were up over 45% from 2010. 
Our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business continued to struggle in 2011. Full year earnings were $6 million compared to $16 million in 2010. Fourth quarter earnings were $3 million compared to no operating income in the previous year. For the past 2 years, this unit has been burdened with uneconomic pipeline capacity contracts. However, we were able to accelerate the termination of some of those contracts last year, and most of the remaining uneconomic contracts will expire over the next 12 months. 
Now let me turn to the future and give you some insight into each business units' prospects. Year in, year out, Houston Electric has been able to earn its regulated rate of return since we formed CenterPoint Energy in 2002. I expect that it will perform well this year. It has a solid and growing service territory. The Houston metropolitan area was the first area in the nation to replace the jobs lost during the economic downturn, and more than 80,000 jobs are expected to be created this year. We estimate that customer growth will equal or exceed the growth we experienced last year, which should add approximately $25 million in base revenues. However, Houston Electric is unlikely to equal its 2011 financial performance, which I -- as I indicated earlier was driven by record heat. This unusual weather added approximately $60 million to base revenues last year. 
In addition, the negative impact of the rates implemented in September of last year will be experienced for the full year in 2012. We expect this to be approximately -- estimate this to be approximately $35 million. Over the longer term, Houston Electric should experience significant rate base growth. Annual capital expenditures are forecast to average between $500 million and $550 million over the next 5 years, resulting in annual rate base growth of over 4%. Because of the recently approved distribution cost recovery factor, together with the long-standing transmission cost recovery mechanism, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. We anticipate rate-based growth at our gas LDCs as well. Over the next 5 years, capital expenditures are expected to exceed $350 million a year, compared to an historical run rate of about $200 million a year. These  increased expenditures are primarily related to new pipeline integrity and safety requirements, and will result in an annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Although we have rate adjustment mechanisms in most jurisdictions, we will likely need to file a number of rate cases over the next 12 to 18 months. While the current low natural gas prices are positive for both Houston Electric and our gas LDCs, they can negatively affect our Midstream business. This is particularly true for our Field Services unit. As we've indicated in the past, we retained over 1.5% of all gas we gather. While the majority of our revenue stream is fee based, we do earn revenues from the sale of this retained gas. We estimate that each $1 change in natural gas prices will have about a $20 million impact on operating income this year. 
In addition, as gas prices have fallen, rig activity in dry gas basins has also declined. This is most significant in our traditional gathering area, where we've seen some gathering volumes decline over 10% since 2010. Increasing gathering volumes in the shale plays  however, have more than offset this decline. Overall, gathering volumes increased almost 30% last year and by year end we were gathering about 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. We expect total gathering volumes under our current contracts will increase about 15% to 20% this year. 
Low natural gas prices in compressed basis differentials are also expected to impact our Interstate Pipelines. It is unlikely any significant new pipelines will be needed in the near term in our current Mid-Continent footprint, and there will be increased competition for new and existing customers. 
In addition, the exploration of a backhaul agreement last year, will reduce operating income by approximately $10 million this year. However we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines particularly power generation customers. Over the last few years our Energy Services business has suffered like many others in the industry. As I indicated earlier, the principal drag on earnings has been related to uneconomic pipeline capacity agreements. We've taken actions to reduce our exposure to such agreements by an estimated $15 million this year. 
Our retail business continues to do well and we expect 2012 will be a year of significant improvement for this business. Of course, we also expect to realize earnings benefits from the $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs we recovered last month. Earlier this year, we called or tendered for our $375 million of debt at the parent company. Gary will provide the details and earnings impact from this debt reduction in a few minutes. 
As we indicated in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to invest the remaining proceeds in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. While we are not in a position to make any announcements today, I feel confident we will be successful in deploying a portion of these proceeds to expand our present businesses, and we are currently evaluating several possibilities particularly in the Field Services sector. 
As I indicated earlier, we will also be required to make significant new capital investments in our existing regulated businesses to satisfy both growth and regulatory requirements. I'd like to remind you of the $20.25 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 19. This marks the 7th consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to our employees, through whose hard work we achieved not only an outstanding 2011, but excellent operating and financial performance since our inception in 2002. As many of you know, we face some significant challenges in our early years. But I think we are stronger today because of our success in overcoming them and I'm convinced our future is even brighter. We have terrific employees, well-positioned assets and business units and a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can excel under a variety of market conditions. 
Thank you again for your interest in the company. I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable r",858,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable resolution of the true-up case last year, the rating agencies have taken positive actions to upgrade the long-term ratings of the debt of CenterPoint Energy, CE and CERC. Each company now has solid investment grade credit ratings and the ratings outlook for each company is either stable or positive. 
In addition, our business has generated solid cash flows and when combined with the benefits of bonus depreciation, essentially funded our capital program and dividend in 2011. We ended 2011 with net debt of approximately $6.7 billion and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 61.2%. 
In January of this year, we closed on the sale of approximately $1.7 billion in transition bonds with an effective annual weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.5%. We were very pleased with this offering, which resulted in one of the lowest rates of any utility securitization. The company received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the offering. 
Our solid balance sheet, cash on hand, internally generated cash and other liquidity provide the company with the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. I know you are all interested in how we are currently using the cash we received from the sale of the transition bond. First, we used a portion of the cash to payoff outstanding commercial paper. In addition, as we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest the cash in long-term accretive projects, we made the decision to reacquire cash exempt debt at the parent company having an aggregate principal amount of $375 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. As this clearly enhances earnings and cash flow relative to the alternative of maintaining cash and money market fund earning approximately 20 basis points. The result will be a reduction in Interest Expense in 2012 of approximately $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This action supports our long-standing objective of deleveraging the parent company. 
As David pointed out, we have a significant capital plan for 2012. We estimate our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million from 2011. About 86% or a little more than $1.1 billion of CapEx will be spent  by our regulated businesses this year compared to 78% in 2011. 
Let me give you a breakdown by business. In our Electric business, we expect to spend $575 million, an increase of $37 million or 7% from 2011. CapEx will be used primarily to support our investments in infrastructure to serve new load and enhance reliability. We expect to spend $354 million in our natural gas distribution business reflecting a 20% increase or $59 million from 2011. This increased level of spending will be used primarily for infrastructure related to pipeline safety and integrity. 
Our pipeline capital budget is $181 million, which is significantly more than our 2011 spend of $98 million. This increase will be used primarily for routine maintenance, major line replacements related to pipeline safety and integrity, as well as spending associated with meeting anticipated new regulatory requirement. 
For the completion of our Magnolia and Olympia systems, our 2012 capital budget for Field Services is $139 million.  However, this estimate does not include any new capital which may be required if we were to have significant new opportunities. To the extent we need financing in connection with future growth opportunity, we expect we can finance them at attractive interest rates at the operating company level. However, we are often asked about our financing strategy for our Midstream business especially whether or not we are considering the formation of an MLP. We continue to think the formation of an MLP can be an efficient structure to finance significant new growth and thus remains a viable option for our company as we evaluate various Midstream projects. 
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $1.8 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is a  somewhat broader guidance range, this somewhat broader guidance range takes into consideration a number of economic and operational variables that may impact our actual earnings performance. Although the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the Texas economy in particular, can have a significant impact to earnings. The most important variables are commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. 
We have developed our guidance range by using combinations of these variables. We have also taken into account the benefit of the $375 million debt reduction at the parent, and we are using an average share count of approximately 430 million shares. In addition, we have not assumed any additional use of the remaining true-up proceed in developing this range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

But we were gathering in total about $2.6 billion at the end of last year. I would say out of our traditional basins, that's more like 750 to 775, something of that nature. We've seen that the traditional basins declined in the fourth quarter more than it did in any other time during the year. As you might recall, the first 3 quarters were pretty flat, but we saw a decline in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that's going to be sustainable, but there's not a lot of rig activity in those dry gas basins at these gas prices. So year-to-year in our traditional basins, we saw about a 10% maybe a little bit more drop in traditional basins gathering. Of course, offsetting all that is the Haynesville gathering we're doing in Magnolia and Olympia. Fayetteville gathering continues to increase. We've got some wet gas in our traditional basins and that's kind of helping us too because there are -- there is some drilling in these basins that -- where there's wet gas. So it turns out, we had an excellent year from a gathering standpoint ending at $2.6 billion a day, which was up, I don't know, 25%, up 30% from 2010. You have to attribute that to all of this, I mean, substantial shale plays and the new investments we made."

But our model suggests we got almost $60 million from normal weather at -- in 2011. So we'll just have to wait to see what happens there. Our growth in customers should add at least $25 million. We've got transmission revenues of another $10 million that should benefit 2012. And we've -- we saw some customer actual usage growth in 2011. We're not sure whether that was real usage or whether it was weather. It was so hot it was hard to distinguish yet. So it could be a little upside there as well. And then we have the full year of the rate case, which might kind of offset some of the things I've talked about. So we think we are going to have a good year. We think we can earn our regulator rate of return next year. But unless we get this hot weather, we probably won't set the same kind of records we did in 2011. I would also say pipelines, it does have a little bit of headwind there because we have that -- the tail end of that backhaul agreement that we didn't feel in the first 4, 5 months of last year, we're going to feel it this year and we estimate that's about a $10 million impact. As you might -- I'm sure you know, there's lots of pipes in the Midcontinent area that are going to be competing with us as we -- as contracts roll off. And we tend to believe that, that could put a little pressure on rates. But having said that, each year we've been able to overcome a lot of these things.

So we'll be chasing those, the competition form but I'd say, it's under 1,000 to 2,000 megawatts around our footprint that we can go after."

Labor and benefits were a fair amount of it, $8 - $9 million on that front. A big part of that was pension expense. We started reflecting the true pension expense in earnings once we implemented this rate case. Remember we were deferring those before. So part of it is pension. We spent a fair amount of money last year because of the drought. We had to do a lot of insulator washing and stuff like that. And we spent a fair money -- a fair amount of incremental money around taking trees out because we had a lot of dead trees and we're really after our tree trimming budgets. So those just kind of added to what look like some unusual O&M expenditures, but we did that because we had the revenues to spend it. And we felt it was a good investment especially as we went into 2012 and 2013, especially if we have any bad weather come through here."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and fin",1643,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and financially. We resolved the long standing issues associated with our 2004 true-up proceeding. And last month, we covered almost $1.7 billion of additional true-up cost through the issuance of securitization bonds. We're pleased this matter is finally behind us and we can now focus our full attention on the future. 
This morning, we reported full year earnings of $1.36 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of the true-up proceeding, net income would have been $546 million or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $442 million or $1.7 per diluted share in 2010. So this was an outstanding year either way you look at it. 
Our fourth quarter results were also solid. Net income was $117 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $124 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter earnings for 2011, on the same basis as we provide earnings guidance, would have been $0.26 per diluted share. This was above our expectations due principally to a lower effective tax rate associated with state income taxes. Our press release and 10-K provide the details around our financial results this past year. So I won't repeat the specifics. 
I will however, summarize the performance of each unit and describe their prospects for 2012 and beyond. Houston Electric had its best year financially. Core operating income was $496 million compared to $427 million in 2010. Fourth quarter income was $62 million, up $6 million from 2010. Last summer's record heat was the biggest driver of Houston Electric's increased income. 
In addition, we saw strong growth in Houston with over 45,000 new customers added last year. Our gas LDCs also had a good year. Operating income for the full year was $226 million or about $5 million below the record level of 2010. Fourth quarter income was $73 million compared to $86 million in 2010. While margin growth was modest last year, we were successful in our expense management efforts. As a result, on an overall basis, we earned at or near our authorized rate of return for the second consecutive year. 
Our Interstate Pipelines achieved operating income of $248 million last year down from the $270 million in 2010. Income in the fourth quarter was $52 million compared to $63 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were almost completely attributable to the exploration of a backhaul contract on our Carthage to Perryville line. 
Our Field Services unit had a very strong year. As a result of the investments we've made to gather and treat gas in several developing shale plays. Full year operating income was $189 million, compared to $151 million the previous year. Fourth quarter earnings were $53 million compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is worth noting that operating income for 2010 reflected a gain of $21 million from the sale of some nonstrategic assets. Excluding that onetime gain, last year's fourth quarter earnings were up over 45% from 2010. 
Our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business continued to struggle in 2011. Full year earnings were $6 million compared to $16 million in 2010. Fourth quarter earnings were $3 million compared to no operating income in the previous year. For the past 2 years, this unit has been burdened with uneconomic pipeline capacity contracts. However, we were able to accelerate the termination of some of those contracts last year, and most of the remaining uneconomic contracts will expire over the next 12 months. 
Now let me turn to the future and give you some insight into each business units' prospects. Year in, year out, Houston Electric has been able to earn its regulated rate of return since we formed CenterPoint Energy in 2002. I expect that it will perform well this year. It has a solid and growing service territory. The Houston metropolitan area was the first area in the nation to replace the jobs lost during the economic downturn, and more than 80,000 jobs are expected to be created this year. We estimate that customer growth will equal or exceed the growth we experienced last year, which should add approximately $25 million in base revenues. However, Houston Electric is unlikely to equal its 2011 financial performance, which I -- as I indicated earlier was driven by record heat. This unusual weather added approximately $60 million to base revenues last year. 
In addition, the negative impact of the rates implemented in September of last year will be experienced for the full year in 2012. We expect this to be approximately -- estimate this to be approximately $35 million. Over the longer term, Houston Electric should experience significant rate base growth. Annual capital expenditures are forecast to average between $500 million and $550 million over the next 5 years, resulting in annual rate base growth of over 4%. Because of the recently approved distribution cost recovery factor, together with the long-standing transmission cost recovery mechanism, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. We anticipate rate-based growth at our gas LDCs as well. Over the next 5 years, capital expenditures are expected to exceed $350 million a year, compared to an historical run rate of about $200 million a year. These  increased expenditures are primarily related to new pipeline integrity and safety requirements, and will result in an annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Although we have rate adjustment mechanisms in most jurisdictions, we will likely need to file a number of rate cases over the next 12 to 18 months. While the current low natural gas prices are positive for both Houston Electric and our gas LDCs, they can negatively affect our Midstream business. This is particularly true for our Field Services unit. As we've indicated in the past, we retained over 1.5% of all gas we gather. While the majority of our revenue stream is fee based, we do earn revenues from the sale of this retained gas. We estimate that each $1 change in natural gas prices will have about a $20 million impact on operating income this year. 
In addition, as gas prices have fallen, rig activity in dry gas basins has also declined. This is most significant in our traditional gathering area, where we've seen some gathering volumes decline over 10% since 2010. Increasing gathering volumes in the shale plays  however, have more than offset this decline. Overall, gathering volumes increased almost 30% last year and by year end we were gathering about 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. We expect total gathering volumes under our current contracts will increase about 15% to 20% this year. 
Low natural gas prices in compressed basis differentials are also expected to impact our Interstate Pipelines. It is unlikely any significant new pipelines will be needed in the near term in our current Mid-Continent footprint, and there will be increased competition for new and existing customers. 
In addition, the exploration of a backhaul agreement last year, will reduce operating income by approximately $10 million this year. However we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines particularly power generation customers. Over the last few years our Energy Services business has suffered like many others in the industry. As I indicated earlier, the principal drag on earnings has been related to uneconomic pipeline capacity agreements. We've taken actions to reduce our exposure to such agreements by an estimated $15 million this year. 
Our retail business continues to do well and we expect 2012 will be a year of significant improvement for this business. Of course, we also expect to realize earnings benefits from the $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs we recovered last month. Earlier this year, we called or tendered for our $375 million of debt at the parent company. Gary will provide the details and earnings impact from this debt reduction in a few minutes. 
As we indicated in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to invest the remaining proceeds in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. While we are not in a position to make any announcements today, I feel confident we will be successful in deploying a portion of these proceeds to expand our present businesses, and we are currently evaluating several possibilities particularly in the Field Services sector. 
As I indicated earlier, we will also be required to make significant new capital investments in our existing regulated businesses to satisfy both growth and regulatory requirements. I'd like to remind you of the $20.25 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 19. This marks the 7th consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to our employees, through whose hard work we achieved not only an outstanding 2011, but excellent operating and financial performance since our inception in 2002. As many of you know, we face some significant challenges in our early years. But I think we are stronger today because of our success in overcoming them and I'm convinced our future is even brighter. We have terrific employees, well-positioned assets and business units and a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can excel under a variety of market conditions. 
Thank you again for your interest in the company. I will now turn the call over to Gary."
279513,145850848,268003,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2012",2012-02-29,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable r",858,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable resolution of the true-up case last year, the rating agencies have taken positive actions to upgrade the long-term ratings of the debt of CenterPoint Energy, CE and CERC. Each company now has solid investment grade credit ratings and the ratings outlook for each company is either stable or positive. 
In addition, our business has generated solid cash flows and when combined with the benefits of bonus depreciation, essentially funded our capital program and dividend in 2011. We ended 2011 with net debt of approximately $6.7 billion and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 61.2%. 
In January of this year, we closed on the sale of approximately $1.7 billion in transition bonds with an effective annual weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.5%. We were very pleased with this offering, which resulted in one of the lowest rates of any utility securitization. The company received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the offering. 
Our solid balance sheet, cash on hand, internally generated cash and other liquidity provide the company with the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. I know you are all interested in how we are currently using the cash we received from the sale of the transition bond. First, we used a portion of the cash to payoff outstanding commercial paper. In addition, as we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest the cash in long-term accretive projects, we made the decision to reacquire cash exempt debt at the parent company having an aggregate principal amount of $375 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. As this clearly enhances earnings and cash flow relative to the alternative of maintaining cash and money market fund earning approximately 20 basis points. The result will be a reduction in Interest Expense in 2012 of approximately $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This action supports our long-standing objective of deleveraging the parent company. 
As David pointed out, we have a significant capital plan for 2012. We estimate our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million from 2011. About 86% or a little more than $1.1 billion of CapEx will be spent  by our regulated businesses this year compared to 78% in 2011. 
Let me give you a breakdown by business. In our Electric business, we expect to spend $575 million, an increase of $37 million or 7% from 2011. CapEx will be used primarily to support our investments in infrastructure to serve new load and enhance reliability. We expect to spend $354 million in our natural gas distribution business reflecting a 20% increase or $59 million from 2011. This increased level of spending will be used primarily for infrastructure related to pipeline safety and integrity. 
Our pipeline capital budget is $181 million, which is significantly more than our 2011 spend of $98 million. This increase will be used primarily for routine maintenance, major line replacements related to pipeline safety and integrity, as well as spending associated with meeting anticipated new regulatory requirement. 
For the completion of our Magnolia and Olympia systems, our 2012 capital budget for Field Services is $139 million.  However, this estimate does not include any new capital which may be required if we were to have significant new opportunities. To the extent we need financing in connection with future growth opportunity, we expect we can finance them at attractive interest rates at the operating company level. However, we are often asked about our financing strategy for our Midstream business especially whether or not we are considering the formation of an MLP. We continue to think the formation of an MLP can be an efficient structure to finance significant new growth and thus remains a viable option for our company as we evaluate various Midstream projects. 
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $1.8 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is a  somewhat broader guidance range, this somewhat broader guidance range takes into consideration a number of economic and operational variables that may impact our actual earnings performance. Although the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the Texas economy in particular, can have a significant impact to earnings. The most important variables are commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. 
We have developed our guidance range by using combinations of these variables. We have also taken into account the benefit of the $375 million debt reduction at the parent, and we are using an average share count of approximately 430 million shares. In addition, we have not assumed any additional use of the remaining true-up proceed in developing this range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

But we were gathering in total about $2.6 billion at the end of last year. I would say out of our traditional basins, that's more like 750 to 775, something of that nature. We've seen that the traditional basins declined in the fourth quarter more than it did in any other time during the year. As you might recall, the first 3 quarters were pretty flat, but we saw a decline in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that's going to be sustainable, but there's not a lot of rig activity in those dry gas basins at these gas prices. So year-to-year in our traditional basins, we saw about a 10% maybe a little bit more drop in traditional basins gathering. Of course, offsetting all that is the Haynesville gathering we're doing in Magnolia and Olympia. Fayetteville gathering continues to increase. We've got some wet gas in our traditional basins and that's kind of helping us too because there are -- there is some drilling in these basins that -- where there's wet gas. So it turns out, we had an excellent year from a gathering standpoint ending at $2.6 billion a day, which was up, I don't know, 25%, up 30% from 2010.

But our model suggests we got almost $60 million from normal weather at -- in 2011. So we'll just have to wait to see what happens there. Our growth in customers should add at least $25 million. We've got transmission revenues of another $10 million that should benefit 2012. And we've -- we saw some customer actual usage growth in 2011. We're not sure whether that was real usage or whether it was weather. It was so hot it was hard to distinguish yet. So it could be a little upside there as well. And then we have the full year of the rate case, which might kind of offset some of the things I've talked about. So we think we are going to have a good year. We think we can earn our regulator rate of return next year. But unless we get this hot weather, we probably won't set the same kind of records we did in 2011. I would also say pipelines, it does have a little bit of headwind there because we have that -- the tail end of that backhaul agreement that we didn't feel in the first 4, 5 months of last year, we're going to feel it this year and we estimate that's about a $10 million impact. As you might -- I'm sure you know, there's lots of pipes in the Midcontinent area that are going to be competing with us as we -- as contracts roll off.

279513,145850848,282247,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 29, 2012",2012-02-29,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and fin",1643,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2011 was a very good year for the company, 4 of our 5 business units had strong years both operationally and financially. We resolved the long standing issues associated with our 2004 true-up proceeding. And last month, we covered almost $1.7 billion of additional true-up cost through the issuance of securitization bonds. We're pleased this matter is finally behind us and we can now focus our full attention on the future. 
This morning, we reported full year earnings of $1.36 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts of the true-up proceeding, net income would have been $546 million or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $442 million or $1.7 per diluted share in 2010. So this was an outstanding year either way you look at it. 
Our fourth quarter results were also solid. Net income was $117 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $124 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter earnings for 2011, on the same basis as we provide earnings guidance, would have been $0.26 per diluted share. This was above our expectations due principally to a lower effective tax rate associated with state income taxes. Our press release and 10-K provide the details around our financial results this past year. So I won't repeat the specifics. 
I will however, summarize the performance of each unit and describe their prospects for 2012 and beyond. Houston Electric had its best year financially. Core operating income was $496 million compared to $427 million in 2010. Fourth quarter income was $62 million, up $6 million from 2010. Last summer's record heat was the biggest driver of Houston Electric's increased income. 
In addition, we saw  strong growth in Houston with over 45,000 new customers added last year. Our gas LDCs also had a good year. Operating income for the full year was $226 million or about $5 million below the record level of 2010. Fourth quarter income was $73 million compared to $86 million in 2010. While margin growth was modest last year, we were successful in our expense management efforts. As a result, on an overall basis, we earned at or near our authorized rate of return for the second consecutive year. 
Our Interstate Pipelines achieved operating income of $248 million last year down from the $270 million in 2010. Income in the fourth quarter was $52 million compared to $63 million in the previous year. The decline in earnings for the full year and fourth quarter were almost completely attributable to the exploration of a backhaul contract on our Carthage to Perryville line. 
Our Field Services unit had a very strong year. As a result of the investments we've made to gather and treat gas in several developing shale plays. Full year operating income was $189 million, compared to $151 million the previous year. Fourth quarter earnings were $53 million compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is worth noting that operating income for 2010 reflected a gain of $21 million from the sale of some nonstrategic assets. Excluding that onetime gain, last year's fourth quarter earnings were up over 45% from 2010. 
Our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business continued to struggle in 2011. Full year earnings were $6 million compared to $16 million in 2010. Fourth quarter earnings were $3 million compared to no operating income in the previous year. For the past 2 years, this unit has been burdened with uneconomic pipeline capacity contracts. However, we were able to accelerate the termination of some of those contracts last year, and most of the remaining uneconomic contracts will expire over the next 12 months. 
Now let me turn to the future and give you some insight into each business units' prospects. Year in, year out, Houston Electric has been able to earn its regulated rate of return since we formed CenterPoint Energy in 2002. I expect that it will perform well this year. It has a solid and growing service territory. The Houston metropolitan area was the first area in the nation to replace the jobs lost during the economic downturn, and more than 80,000 jobs are expected to be created this year. We estimate that customer growth will equal or exceed the growth we experienced last year, which should add approximately $25 million in base revenues. However, Houston Electric is unlikely to equal its 2011 financial performance, which I -- as I indicated earlier was driven by record heat. This unusual weather added approximately $60 million to base revenues last year. 
In addition, the negative impact of the rates implemented in September of last year will be experienced for the full year in 2012. We expect this to be approximately -- estimate this to be approximately $35 million. Over the longer term, Houston Electric should experience significant rate base growth. Annual capital expenditures are forecast to average between $500 million and $550 million over the next 5 years, resulting in annual rate base growth of over 4%. Because of the recently approved distribution cost recovery factor, together with the long-standing transmission cost recovery mechanism, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. We anticipate rate-based growth at our gas LDCs as well. Over the next 5 years, capital expenditures are expected to exceed $350 million a year, compared to an historical run rate of about $200 million a year. These  increased expenditures are primarily related to new pipeline integrity and safety requirements, and will result in an annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
 Although we have rate adjustment mechanisms in most jurisdictions, we will likely need to file a number of rate cases over the next 12 to 18 months. While the current low natural gas prices are positive for both Houston Electric and our gas LDCs, they can negatively affect our Midstream business. This is particularly true for our Field Services unit. As we've indicated in the past, we retained over 1.5% of all gas we gather. While the majority of our revenue stream is fee based, we do earn revenues from the sale of this retained gas. We estimate that each $1 change in natural gas prices will have about a $20 million impact on operating income this year. 
In addition, as gas prices have fallen, rig activity in dry gas basins has also declined. This is most significant in our traditional gathering area, where we've seen some gathering volumes decline over 10% since 2010. Increasing gathering volumes in the shale plays  however, have more than offset this decline. Overall, gathering volumes increased almost 30% last year and by year end we were gathering about 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. We expect total gathering volumes under our current contracts will increase about 15% to 20% this year. 
  Low natural gas prices in compressed basis differentials are also expected to impact our Interstate Pipelines. It is unlikely any significant new pipelines will be needed in the near term in our current Mid-Continent footprint, and there will be increased competition for new and existing customers. 
In addition, the exploration of a backhaul agreement last year, will reduce operating income by approximately $10 million this year.  However we believe there are continuing opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines particularly power generation customers. Over the last few years our Energy Services business has suffered like many others in the industry. As I indicated earlier, the principal drag on earnings has been related to uneconomic pipeline capacity agreements. We've taken actions to reduce our exposure to such agreements by an estimated $15 million this year. 
Our retail business continues to do well and we expect 2012 will be a year of significant improvement for this business. Of course, we also expect to realize earnings benefits from the $1.7 billion of additional true-up costs we recovered last month. Earlier this year, we called or tendered for our $375 million of debt at the parent company. Gary will provide the details and earnings impact from this debt reduction in a few minutes. 
As we indicated in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to invest the remaining proceeds in our existing businesses and to acquire similar assets. While we are not in a position to make any announcements today, I feel confident we will be successful in deploying a portion of these proceeds to expand our present businesses, and we are currently evaluating several possibilities particularly in the Field Services sector. 
As I indicated earlier, we will also be required to make significant new capital investments in our existing regulated businesses to satisfy both growth and regulatory requirements. I'd like to remind you of the $20.25 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 19. This marks the 7th consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to our employees, through whose hard work we achieved not only an outstanding 2011, but excellent operating and financial performance since our inception in 2002. As many of you know, we face some significant challenges in our early years. But I think we are stronger today because of our success in overcoming them and I'm convinced our future is even brighter. We have terrific employees, well-positioned assets and business units and a balanced and diversified portfolio, which can excel under a variety of market conditions. 
Thank you again for your interest in the company. I will now turn the call over to Gary."

First, since the formation of our company in October of 2002, we have significantly improved our balance sheet. As you know, subsequent to the favorable resolution of the true-up case last year, the rating agencies have taken positive actions to upgrade the long-term ratings of the debt of CenterPoint Energy, CE and CERC. Each company now has  solid investment grade credit ratings and the ratings outlook for each company is either stable or positive. 
In addition, our business has generated solid cash flows and when combined with the benefits of bonus depreciation, essentially funded our capital program and dividend in 2011. We ended 2011 with net debt of approximately $6.7 billion and a debt to total capitalization ratio of 61.2%. 
In January of this year, we closed on the sale of approximately $1.7 billion in transition bonds with an effective annual weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.5%. We were very pleased with this offering, which resulted in one of the lowest rates of any utility securitization. The company received proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion from the offering. 
Our solid balance sheet, cash on hand, internally generated cash and other liquidity provide the company with the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. I know you are all interested in how we are currently using the cash we received from the sale of the transition bond. First, we used a portion of the cash to payoff outstanding commercial paper. In addition, as we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest the cash in long-term accretive projects, we made the decision to reacquire cash exempt debt at the parent company having an aggregate principal amount of $375 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. As this clearly enhances earnings and cash flow relative to the alternative of maintaining cash and money market fund earning approximately 20 basis points. The result will be a reduction in Interest Expense in 2012 of approximately $18 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This action supports our long-standing objective of deleveraging the parent company. 
As David pointed out, we have a significant capital plan for 2012. We estimate our 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million from 2011. About 86% or a little more than $1.1 billion of CapEx will be spent  by our regulated businesses this year compared to 78% in 2011. 
Let me give you a breakdown by business. In our Electric business, we expect to spend $575 million, an increase of $37 million or 7% from 2011. CapEx will be used primarily to support our investments in infrastructure to serve new load and enhance reliability. We expect to spend $354 million in our natural gas distribution business reflecting a 20% increase or $59 million from 2011. This increased level of spending will be used primarily for infrastructure related to pipeline safety and integrity. 
Our pipeline capital budget is $181 million, which is significantly more than our 2011 spend of $98 million. This increase will be used primarily for routine maintenance, major line replacements related to pipeline safety and integrity, as well as spending associated with meeting anticipated new regulatory requirement. 
For the completion of our Magnolia and Olympia systems, our 2012 capital budget for Field Services is $139 million.  However, this estimate does not include any new capital which may be required if we were to have significant new opportunities. To the extent we need financing in connection with future growth opportunity, we expect we can finance them at attractive interest rates at the operating company level. However, we are often asked about our financing strategy for our Midstream business especially whether or not we are considering the formation of an MLP. We continue to think the formation of an MLP can be an efficient structure to finance significant new growth and thus remains a viable option for our company as we evaluate various Midstream projects. 
Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $1.8 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is a  somewhat broader guidance range,  this  somewhat broader guidance range takes into consideration a number of economic and operational variables that may impact our actual earnings performance. Although the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the Texas economy in particular, can have a significant impact to earnings. The most important variables are commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. 
We have developed our guidance range by using combinations of these variables. We have also taken into account the benefit of the $375 million debt reduction at the parent, and we are using an average share count of approximately 430 million shares. In addition, we have not assumed any additional use of the remaining true-up proceed in developing this range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

But we were gathering in total about $2.6 billion at the end of last year. I would say out of our traditional basins, that's more like 750 to 775, something of that nature. We've seen that the traditional basins declined in the fourth quarter more than it did in any other time during the year. As you might recall, the first 3 quarters were pretty flat, but we saw a decline in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure that's going to be sustainable, but there's not a lot of rig activity in those dry gas basins at these gas prices. So year-to-year in our traditional basins, we saw about a 10% maybe a little bit more drop in traditional basins gathering. Of course, offsetting all that is the Haynesville gathering we're doing in Magnolia and Olympia. Fayetteville gathering continues to increase. We've got some wet gas in our traditional basins and that's kind of helping us too because there are -- there is some drilling in these basins that -- where there's wet gas. So it turns out, we had an excellent year from a gathering standpoint ending at $2.6 billion a day, which was up, I don't know, 25%, up 30% from 2010. You have to attribute that to all of this, I mean, substantial shale plays and the new investments we made."

I will tell you that current weather forecasts are suggesting it's going to be hot and dry again. So it's not out of the question. But our model suggests we got almost $60 million from normal weather at -- in 2011. So we'll just have to wait to see what happens there. Our growth in customers should add at least $25 million. We've got transmission revenues of another $10 million that should benefit 2012. And we've -- we saw some customer actual usage growth in 2011. We're not sure whether that was real usage or whether it was weather. It was so hot it was hard to distinguish yet. So it could be a little upside there as well. And then we have the full year of the rate case, which might kind of offset some of the things I've talked about. So we think we are going to have a good year. We think we can earn our regulator rate of return next year. But unless we get this hot weather, we probably won't set the same kind of records we did in 2011. I would also say pipelines, it does have a little bit of headwind there because we have that -- the tail end of that backhaul agreement that we didn't feel in the first 4, 5 months of last year, we're going to feel it this year and we estimate that's about a $10 million impact. As you might -- I'm sure you know, there's lots of pipes in the Midcontinent area that are going to be  competing with us as we -- as contracts roll off. And we tend to believe that, that could put a little pressure on rates. But having said that, each year we've been able to overcome a lot of these things. So I'm not ready to say that pipeline is not going to have a good year. But they have a little  headwind in front of them  that's for sure. Our Field Services, it really depends on gas prices.

And finally, Gary will provide an update on a few items including guidance. 
We had a solid first quarter given the extremely mild winter weather and low natural gas prices. This morning, we reported net income of $147 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $148 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the same period of 2011. Operating income for the first quarter of 2012 was $338 million compared to $364 million for the same period last year. Our Gas Distribution unit, and to a lesser extent, our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business, were impacted by the mild winter weather. Houston Electric had a very solid quarter. And our midstream businesses met expectations. The diversity of our portfolio certainly helped maintain our earnings this quarter. I'll now ask each of our business unit heads to give more detail around their earnings and prospects. We'll start with Scott, the President of our electric operations."

Houston Electric's first quarter performance was excellent. This year's operating income exceeded the first quarter of last year despite mild weather and the impact of rates implemented last September, which reduced operating income by $11 million. Revenues were bolstered by continued customer growth, a modest increase in usage, return associated with the recovery of true-up proceeds, and increased ancillary revenues, primarily from right away leases. Altogether, the quarter was $2 million favorable to last year. 
We serve one of the most vibrant areas in the nation and the prospects for Houston Electric are exciting. We continue to enjoy a growing service territory with more than 42,000 customers added since the first quarter of last year. More than 93,000 jobs were added during the 12 months ending in February of 2012. And this rate of growth is projected to continue throughout the rest of the year. The Houston unemployment rate is currently 7.2%, down from a peak of 8.8%. Houston is the fourth largest city and the fifth most populous metropolitan area in the country. And the population growth rate of 2% is expected to continue for the next several years. 
Another key driver of growth is low natural gas prices, which support expansion in our refining, base chemicals and downstream products industries. These new facilities will require transmission and substation investments to serve a growing power requirement. Additionally, i n response to the Panama Canal widening, facilities at or near the port of Houston are being expanded to accommodate an increase in cargo movement. This will bring general, commercial and industrial growth, as well as direct low growth associated with the installation of new, larger electric short range. 
Commercial development is also strengthening. Our world-class medical center continues to grow with the addition of 2 million square feet by the end of 2014. Additionally new multipurpose campuses are being developed such as the new Exxon Mobile corporate campus and nearby developments, that would include 5000 homes along with 10 million square feet of commercial office and retail space. 
From a reliability standpoint, we are continuing our efforts to strengthen the grid by modifying our practices around old management, circuit inspection, vegetation management and new construction. Further we are adding operating and control infrastructure that will provide essential redundancy and comply with new federal regulations. 
By midyear of the 2012, we will complete our advanced metering system deployment. This has been a very successful project with relatively few issues and no significant delays. To address the growing infrastructure needs of the Houston service territory, our capital investments will remain robust. Even with our advanced meter project drawing to a close, annual capital expenditures our projects projected to average over $500 million per year for the next 5 years, leading to a 4% annualized growth and rate base. As you may recall, last summer was Houston's hottest on record and this winter was the mildest in over 50 years, so it's is unlikely that Houston Electric will equal its 2011 performance. In addition, the adverse impact of the rate case implemented last September will be experienced for the full year in 2012. However, with the benefit of strong growth, ongoing cost management, transmission cost recovery filings and additional ancillary revenues, we expect Houston Electric to have a good year and return its authorized rate of return. Since we now have capital trackers in place for both distribution and transmission investment, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Tracy Bridge, President of our Gas Distribution business."

For our gas LDCs, this quarter was all about weather. Although our first quarter revenue whether approximately $52 million lower than the first quarter of last year due to weather, we were able to mitigate $28 million of that impact through weather normalization adjustments or weather hedges. When compared to normal, the weather impact was approximately $42 million, which was mitigated by $22 million through these mechanisms. Operation and maintenance expenses were favorable to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to $5 million of reduced bad debt expense. Our credit and collection practices, along with low natural gas prices and mild weather, continued to reduce bad debt expense and we are working diligently on expense management across our business unit. Our service areas continue to grow with more than 13,000 customers added since the first quarter of last year. As Scott mentioned, Houston is a growing service territory. We are also experiencing growth in other areas of Texas, as well as in Minnesota and Mississippi. Unemployment rates are flat-to-down and hiring starts are up from year ago in all 6 states where we operate. Improved operations and customer service continue to the top priorities. We expect to benefit from efficiencies gained from technology advances and utility operations. For example, we are deploying Advanced Metering technology in our Houston Texas Coast and South Texas service areas which will increase productivity by allowing us to read 10,000 meters per vehicle per day compared to 500 meters per person per day. We are very focused on serving our customers more efficiently and effectively and we continue to expand our conservation improvement programs. 
We implemented a number of customer self-service options that allow greater automation and faster service. We believe these types of efforts are paying off. We recently earned the second highest score in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for investor-owned gas and electric utilities in the U.S. and a first place ranking in the midwest region of the J.D. Power annual residential customer satisfaction survey for gas utilities. System safety and reliability also remain a top priority. As David mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we expect capital expenditures to exceed $350 million a year over the next 5 years, a significant increase over the historical run rate of about $200 million a year for this business unit. These increases in capital expenditures are primary related to distribution system upgrades and will result in annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Similar to the mechanisms Scott mentioned for Houston Electric, we also have rate adjustment mechanisms in place in several jurisdictions that allow more timely recovery of capital costs. One such mechanism is the gas reliability infrastructure program, or GRIP, available in Texas. The law provides for annual filings and we recently made GRIP filings in both our Houston and South Texas jurisdictions, requesting a combined $12 million increase in annual revenues. These new rates will begin in July 2012. 
In summary, we will continue to focus on expense management and employee rate adjustment mechanisms to mitigate that significant impacts of weather to date. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg Harper, Group President of Pipelines and Field Services."
279513,183283589,296290,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Road gas prices were the story in the midstream business but our pipeline performed as expected and our Field Services unit continues to grow. Let may begin with our pipelines business. Operating income was $60 million, a decline of $16",1209,"Thank you, Tracy. Road gas prices were the story in the midstream business but our pipeline performed as expected and our Field Services unit continues to grow. Let may begin with our pipelines business. Operating income was $60 million, a decline of $16 million from the first quarter of 2011. Total revenues of $13 million were due primarily to exploration of a backhaul agreement on our Carthage pipeline in midyear 2011. The warm winter are also affected load across our systems was lower than normal and considerably lower than the first quarter of last year. Road gas prices and significantly compressed basis spread adversely affected our office and sales. The combined effect of these 2 factors produced about $3 million decline compared to the same quarter last year. We don't expect that having to change much until we see return of occasional basis spreads and gas price volatility in our market areas. 
On a positive note, we saw improved results in our ancillary services, which increased by about $3 million over the first quarter 2011. As you may now, ancillary services include natural gas processing and treating, as well as balancing services like parking loans or house. Processor and margins continue to be strong due to an increase in volumes of high BTU content gas, coming into our pipelines from liquids-rich plays in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana. also provided improved results in the first quarter. 
As you may recall, we restructured and extended our agreements with our natural gas distribution facilities in 2010. Due to the seasonal structure in these agreements, results for the first quarter of 2012 led to an increase of about $4 million compared to the same quarter last year. These agreements became effective in March 2011. And so for the balance of this year, we expect comparable results to last year. 
Operations and maintenance expenses increased by about $7 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. However, last year's result included a favorable settlement of an insurance claim that reduced our operations and fixed maintenance by about $4 million. Equity earnings from our investment in the Southeast Supply Header, a joint venture with Spectra, was $6 million in 2012, a $2 million increase from the first quarter of the prior year. A restructuring and extend contract within an anchor shipper end of 2011 will result in an improvement especially in 2012 operating results. 
Now I'll turn to the Field Services first quarter results. Operating income from our Field Services business increased by $11 million to $47 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. Despite low natural gas prices, our revenues and margins remained strong, clearly highlighting the value of our fee-based contracting strategy, which emphasizes volume commitments and guarantee returns on our capital deployed. Total gathering volumes for the quarter increased by nearly 30% or 237 billion cubic feet in 2012 across our entire gathering network. More than 70% of those volumes came from the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford shale plays. Average shale throughput for the cost of system grew 2.6 billion cubic feet per day for the quarter compared to 2 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter of 2011. Volumes from our Haynesville Shale gathering system in North Louisiana averaged over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2012. These volumes reflect throughput from shale and in production, as well as third-party shippers on a systems and slightly down from the fourth quarter. With the higher margins from the increasing gathering throughput was partially offset by significant decline in natural gas prices which reduced our margins from sales of natural gas by approximately $6 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Our average realized price per gas was nearly $1.25 lower than the first quarter 2011 and nearly $0.50 lower than last quarter. These low gas prices, if sustained, will adversely impact our full-year results. 
Operation and maintenance expenses declined primarily as a result of ongoing efforts to reduce rental expenses for compression and treating facilities. However, new assets put into place to replace these rentals combined with new facilities Haynesville shale growth resulted in increases and depreciation and taxes other than income. Late last year, Waskom, our processing joint venture placed a 35 million cubic feet per day claim expansion into service that included greater liquids offloading capabilities, and new reloading facility which provide either access to premium liquids markets for Waskom customers. Equity earnings from our 50% share of Waskom were $3 million, an increase of $1 million over the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss what the midstream businesses are focused on this year. As a mentioned earlier, we're seeing significant activity in the liquids-rich natural gas areas. Both the pipeline and self services we're actively pursuing several opportunities in and around our footprint including the Woodford, in Western Oklahoma, the Mississippi line in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas, and Cotton Valley play in East Texas. 
We have a presence near this place, as well as access to end use markets and to the Perryville hub, which we believe makes us an attractive option to the producers developing these areas. Our pipeline is also well positioned to capture opportunities from power generation customers. There are 22 gas-fired power plants currently attached to our systems, of more than half are under contract for firm services in excess of 800 million cubic feet per day. We're in active discussions to increase contracted levels if gas power generation becomes more of a base load than a peaking load for electric power markets. 
We recently filed to amend our Centerpoint Energy gas transmission tariff with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to our customers who choose the Perryville hub as a delivery and receipt point rather than specific points within the hub. So currently we filed an application with the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, to make the Perryville hub a trading point for ICE transactions. We believe our customers will find it beneficial to be able to use ICe to some of their physical transactions. These actions, along with the fact that we have significant interconnectivity with other pipelines and search assets within the hub, will provide our customers with added flexibility. 
In addition, we continue to develop great strategies for our state pipelines. More specifically, in order to address the increased cost on our pipeline today, we have initiated a settlement process with customers for new tariff structure on our Mississippi transmission pipeline. This proposed rate structure will not only update our cost of service, but provide a tracking mechanism for recovering costs associated with environmental and safety regulations. 
Our pipeline group, our Field Services will be especially liquids-rich opportunities within the reach of our gathering and processing footprint. We are also finding the current low gas price environment is presenting new opportunities to acquire producer-owned gathering systems, as well as to partner with producers as they conduct their initial development in new shale plays. We recognized that we're currently operating in a challenging natural gas environment. However, we're pleased with overall performance for our midstream business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe McGolbert, President of our Competitive Energy Services business."
279513,183283589,296290,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg.

Our Energy Services business had an active quarter in which we positioned the business for the future. After adjusting for the timing related variances of mark-to-market accounting and the write-down of inventory to lower of cost or market, operating income declined by $6 million from the same quarter last year. Two major contributors to decline were the mild weather and the low gas prices as discussed by the other business Presidents. The mild weather caused lower usage by our commercial customers and the low gas price, low volatility market environment had the effect of compressing unit margins. 
Although the financial results were down, it was not unexpected and there were several positive developments during the quarter. First, margins from seasonal storage spreads have improved and we should realize better fourth quarter results. For example, margins that averaged $0.50 to $0.60 per MMBTU last year are averaging $0.70 to $0.80 this year with some recent deals exceeding $1. Next, the strategic repositioning we implemented last year is gaining traction. That strategy involved a greater focus in growing our retail business and a corresponding reduction of fixed cost by rightsizing our pipeline transportation capacity used to serve retail customers. As an indicator of our progress, our retail commercial business grew in both customer additions and throughput in the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We added over 2,500 customers since the first quarter of last year, a 21% increase. 1,400 of the new customers came from an acquisition we made late last year and 1,100 from our existing markets. Also, through our fixed cost reduction strategy, we have either not renewed or negotiated a new releases of uneconomic capacity. These actions will reduce our fixed costs and improve our margins as the year progresses. In 2012 alone, we will see approximately $15 million of fixed cost savings. 
Going forward, we expect that this strategic realignment will yield better and more stable results consistent with CenterPoint's investment thesis. Moreover, we continued to see volatile investment opportunities at CES' intrastate pipeline through customer interconnects. The growth appears to be very robust in the petrochemical and other energy intensive industries in the Gulf Coast. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress. We believe the business has turned the corner to once again become a contributor to CenterPoint Energy's earnings growth. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Gary Whitlock, Executive Vice President and CFO."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I'd like to provide you with an update on the use of cash we received from the sale of the transition bonds in January. As I mentioned last quarter,",434,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I'd like to provide you with an update on the use of cash we received from the sale of the transition bonds in January. As I mentioned last quarter, in addition to paying off our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of approximately $200 million, we reacquired tax exempt debt as a parent company with a principal amount of $375 million, and a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. In addition to these actions on April 1, we retired approximately $46 million of maturing debt in Houston Electric for a coupon of 3.625%. In total, we have paid down our debt by more than $600 million which will result in a reduction in interest expense in 2012 of approximately $19 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Our objective for the remaining $1-plus billion in cash is to have our businesses invest the money in accretive, long-term projects and we are working diligently to do so. 
We continue to receive questions about our financing strategy for our midstream business especially whether or not we intend to form an MLP. Since we have previously said, the key variable for us is ensuring that we have visible long-term growth opportunity that marries the information and use of MLP. 
Now, let me discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our estimate for earnings in the range of $1.08 to $1.20 per diluted share. As previously discussed, we have developed our earnings guidance range by using a number of variables such as commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. Clearly, the extremely mild winter weather and low natural gas prices have been negatives to earnings in the first quarter. On the other hand, the earnings performance of Houston Electric and a lower effective tax rate have been positive. We have taken into account the benefit of the debt reductions I mentioned earlier. However, we have not assumed any additional uses of our cash in developing these earnings range. As of the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
And finally, I would like to remind you of the twenty and quarter cent per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 26. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence of the Board of Directors in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. I will now turn the call back to Marianne."

And finally, Gary will provide an update on a few items including guidance. 
We had a solid first quarter given the extremely mild winter weather and low natural gas prices. This morning, we reported net income of $147 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $148 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the same period of 2011. Operating income for the first quarter of 2012 was $338 million compared to $364 million for the same period last year. Our gas distribution unit, and to a lesser extent, our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business, were impacted by the mild winter weather. Houston Electric had a very solid quarter, and our midstream businesses met expectations. The diversity of our portfolio certainly helped maintain our earnings this quarter. I'll now ask each of our business unit heads to give more detail around their earnings and prospects. We'll start with Scott, the President of our Electric Operations."

Houston Electric's first quarter performance was excellent. This year's operating income exceeded the first quarter of last year despite mild weather and the impact of rates implemented last September, which",604,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Houston Electric's first quarter performance was excellent. This year's operating income exceeded the first quarter of last year despite mild weather and the impact of rates implemented last September, which reduced operating income by $11 million. Revenues were bolstered by continued customer growth, a modest increase in usage, return associated with the recovery of true-up proceeds, and increased ancillary revenues, primarily from right away leases. Altogether, the quarter was $2 million favorable to last year. 
We serve one of the most vibrant areas in the nation and the prospects for Houston Electric are exciting. We continue to enjoy a growing service territory with more than 42,000 customers added since the first quarter of last year. More than 93,000 jobs were added during the 12 months ending in February of 2012. And this rate of growth is projected to continue throughout the rest of the year. The Houston unemployment rate is currently 7.2%, down from a peak of 8.8%. Houston is the fourth largest city and the fifth most populous metropolitan area in the country. And the population growth rate of 2% is expected to continue for the next several years. 
Another key driver of growth is low natural gas prices, which support expansion in our refining, base chemicals and downstream products industries. These new facilities will require transmission and substation investments to serve a growing power requirement. Additionally, in response to the Panama Canal widening, facilities at or near the port of Houston are being expanded to accommodate an increase in cargo movement. This will bring general, commercial and industrial growth, as well as direct low growth associated with the installation of new, larger electric short range. 
Commercial development is also strengthening. Our world-class medical center continues to grow with the addition of 2 million square feet by the end of 2014. Additionally, new multipurpose campuses are being developed, such as the new ExxonMobil corporate campus and nearby development, that will include 5,000 homes along with 10 million square feet of commercial office and retail space. 
From a reliability standpoint, we are continuing our efforts to strengthen the grid by modifying our practices around ple management, circuit inspection, vegetation management and new construction. Further, we are adding operating and control infrastructure that will provide essential redundancy and comply with new federal regulations. 
By midyear of 2012, we will complete our advanced metering system deployment. This has been a very successful project with relatively few issues and no significant delays. To address the growing infrastructure needs of the Houston service territory, our capital investments will remain robust. Even with our advanced metering project drawing to a close, annual capital expenditures are projected to average over $500 million per year for the next 5 years, leading to a 4% annualized growth and rate base. As you may recall, last summer was Houston's hottest on record and this winter was the mildest in over 50 years. So it is unlikely that Houston Electric will equal its 2011 performance. In addition, the adverse impact of the rate case implemented last September will be experienced for the full year in 2012. However, with the benefit of strong growth, ongoing cost management, transmission cost recovery filings and additional ancillary revenues, we expect Houston Electric to have a good year and return its authorized rate of return. Since we now have capital trackers in place for both distribution and transmission investment, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tracy Bridge, President of our Gas Distribution business."
279513,183283589,296583,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. For our gas LDCs, this quarter was all about weather.

For our gas LDCs, this quarter was all about weather. Although our first quarter revenues were approximately $52 million lower than the first quarter of last year due to weather, we were able to mitigate $28 million of that impact through weather normalization adjustments or weather hedges. When compared to normal, the weather impact was approximately $42 million, which was mitigated by $22 million through these mechanisms. Operation and maintenance expenses were favorable to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to $5 million of reduced bad debt expense. Our credit and collection practices, along with low natural gas prices and mild weather, continued to reduce bad debt expense and we are working diligently on expense management across our business unit. Our service areas continue to grow with more than 13,000 customers added since the first quarter of last year. 
As Scott mentioned, Houston is a growing service territory. We are also experiencing growth in other areas of Texas, as well as in Minnesota and Mississippi. Unemployment rates are flat-to-down and housing starts are up from a year ago in all 6 states where we operate. Improved operations and customer service continue to be top priorities. We expect to benefit from efficiencies gained from technology advances and utility operations. For example, we are deploying advanced metering technology in our Houston Texas coast and South Texas service areas, which will increase productivity by allowing us to read 10,000 meters per vehicle per day compared to 500 meters per person per day. We are very focused on serving our customers more efficiently and effectively and we continue to expand our conservation improvement programs. 
We implemented a number of customer self-service options that allow greater automation and faster service. We believe these types of efforts are paying off. We recently earned the second highest score in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for investor-owned gas and electric utilities in the U.S. and a first place ranking in the midwest region of the J.D. Power Annual Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey for gas utilities. System safety and reliability also remain a top priority. As David mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we expect capital expenditures to exceed $350 million a year over the next 5 years, a significant increase over the historical run rate of about $200 million a year for this business unit. These increases in capital expenditures are primarily related to distribution system upgrades and will result in annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Similar to the mechanisms Scott mentioned for Houston Electric, we also have rate adjustment mechanisms in place in several jurisdictions that allow more timely recovery of capital costs. One such mechanism is the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program, or G.R.I.P., available in Texas. The law provides for annual filings and we recently made GRIP filings in both our Houston and South Texas jurisdictions, requesting a combined $12 million increase in annual revenues. These new rates will begin in July 2012. 
In summary, we will continue to focus on expense management and employee rate adjustment mechanisms to mitigate the significant impacts of weather to date. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg Harper, Group President of Pipelines and Field Services."
279513,183283589,296583,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Low gas prices were the story in the midstream business, but our pipeline performed as expected and our Field Services unit continues to grow. Let me begin with our Pipelines business. Operating income was $60 million, a decline of $16 m",1226,"Thank you, Tracy. Low gas prices were the story in the midstream business, but our pipeline performed as expected and our Field Services unit continues to grow. Let me begin with our Pipelines business. Operating income was $60 million, a decline of $16 million from the first quarter of 2011. Total revenues of $13 million were due primarily to the expiration of a backhaul agreement on our Carthage to Perryville pipeline in midyear 2011. The warm winter also affected loads across our system with lower than normal and considerably lower than the first quarter of last year. Low gas prices and significantly compressed basis spreads adversely affected our office and sales. The combined effect of these two factors produced about a $3 million decline compared to the same quarter last year. We don't expect that having to change much until we see return of occasional basis spreads and gas price volatility on our market areas. 
On a positive note, we saw improved results in our ancillary services, which increased by about $3 million over the first quarter 2011. As you may know, ancillary services include natural gas processing and treating, as well as balancing services like parking loans or PALs. Processing margins continue to be strong due to an increase in volumes of high BTU content gas coming into our pipelines from liquids-rich plays in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana. PALs also provided improved results in the first quarter. 
As you may recall, we restructured and extended our agreements with our natural gas distribution facilities in 2010. Due to the seasonal structure in these agreements, results for the first quarter of 2012 led to increase of about $4 million compared to the same quarter last year. These agreements became effective in March 2011. And so for the balance of this year, we expect comparable results to last year. 
Our operations and maintenance expenses increased by about $7 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. However, last year's result included a favorable settlement of an insurance claim that reduced our operations and maintenance fixed messages by about $4 million. Equity earnings from our investment in the Southeast Supply Header, a joint venture with Spectra, was $6 million in 2012, a $2 million increase from the first quarter of the prior year. A restructuring and extended contract within an anchor shipper near the end of 2011 will result in an improvement especially this 2012 operating results. 
Now I'll turn to the Field Services first quarter results. Operating income from our Field Services business increased by $11 million to $47 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. Despite low natural gas prices, our revenues and margins remained strong, clearly highlighting the value of our fee-based contracting strategy, which emphasizes volume commitments and guarantee returns on our capital deployed. Total gathering volumes for the quarter increased by nearly 30% or 237 billion cubic feet in 2012 across our entire gathering network. More than 70% of those volumes came from the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford shale plays. Average shale throughput across our system grew 2.6 billion cubic feet per day for the quarter compared to 2 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter of 2011. Volumes from our Haynesville Shale gathering system in North Louisiana averaged over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2012. These volumes reflect throughput from shale and Encana production, as well as third-party shippers on the systems and is slightly down from the fourth quarter. But the higher margins from the increasing gathering throughput was partially offset by significant decline in natural gas prices, which reduced our margins for sales of retained natural gas by approximately $6 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Our average realized price per gas was nearly $1.25 lower than the first quarter 2011 and nearly $0.50 lower than last quarter. These low gas prices, if sustained, will adversely impact our full-year results. 
Operation and maintenance expenses declined primarily as a result of ongoing efforts to reduce rental expenses for compression and treating facilities. However, new assets put into place to replace these rentals, combined with new facilities built handoff Haynesville shale growth resulted in increases and depreciation and taxes other than income. Late last year, Waskom, our processing joint venture, placed a 30 million -- 35 million cubic feet per day claim expansion into service that included greater liquids offloading capabilities, and new reloading facility, which provides either access to premium liquids markets for Waskom customers. Equity earnings from our 50% share of Waskom were $3 million, an increase of $1 million over the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss what the midstream businesses are focused on this year. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing a significant activity in the liquids-rich natural gas areas. Both the pipelines and self services were actively pursuing several opportunities in and around our footprint including the Cana/Woodford in Western Oklahoma, the Mississippi line in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas, and the Cotton Valley play in East Texas. 
We have a presence near this place, as well as access to end-use markets and to the Perryville hub, which we believe makes us an attractive option to the producers developing these areas. Our pipelines are also well positioned to capture opportunities from power generation customers. There are 22 gas-fired power plants currently attached to our system, of which, more than half are under contract for firm services in excess of 800 million cubic feet per day. We're in active discussions to increase contracted levels as gas power generation becomes more of a base load rather than a peaking load for the electric power markets. 
We recently filed to amend our Centerpoint Energy gas transmission tariff with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through our customers that choose the Perryville hub as a delivery and receipt point rather than specific points within the hub. Currently we filed the application with the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, to make the Perryville hub a trading point for ICE transactions. We believe our customers will find it beneficial to be able to use ICE to settle their physical transactions. These actions, along with the fact that we have significant interconnectivity with other pipelines and storage assets with them, we'll provide our customers with added flexibility. 
In addition, we continue to develop great strategies for two interstate pipelines. More specifically, in order to address the increased costs on our pipeline today, we have initiated a settlement process with customers for a new tariff structure on our Mississippi river transmission pipeline. This proposed rate structure will not only update our cost of service, but provides a tracking mechanism for recovering costs associated with environmental and safety regulations. 
Much like our Pipeline group, our Field Services group is pursuing liquid-rich opportunities within the reach of our gathering and processing footprint. We are also finding that the current low gas price environment is presenting new opportunities to acquire producer-owned gathering systems, as well as to partner with producers as they conduct their initial development in new shale plays. We recognize that we're currently operating in a challenging natural gas environment. However, we're pleased with the overall performance for our midstream business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick, President of our Competitive Energy Services business."

Our Energy Services business an active quarter in which we positioned the business for the future. After adjusting for the timing-related variances of mark-to-market accounting and the write-down of the inventory to lower of cost for market, operating income declined by $6 million from the same quarter of last year. Two major contributors to the decline were the mild weather and the low gas prices as discussed by the other business Presidents. The mild weather caused lower usage by our commercial customers and the low gas price, low volatility market environment had the effect of compressing unit margins. 
Although the financial results were down, it was not unexpected, and there were several positive developments during the quarter. First, margins from seasonal storage spreads have improved and we should realize better fourth quarter results. For example, margins that averaged $0.50 to $0.60 per MMBTU last year are averaging $0.70 to $0.80 this year with some recent deals exceeding $1. Next, the strategic repositioning we implemented last year is gaining traction. That strategy involved a greater focus in growing our retail business and a corresponding reduction of fixed cost by rightsizing our pipeline transportation capacity used to serve retail customers. As an indicator of our progress, our retail commercial business grew in both customer additions and throughput in the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We added over 2,500 customers since the first quarter of last year, a 21% increase. 1,400 of the new customers came from an acquisition we made late last year and 1,100 from our existing markets. Also, through our fixed cost reduction strategy, we have either not renewed or negotiated early releases of uneconomic capacity. These actions will reduce our fixed costs and improve our margins as the year progresses. In 2012 alone, we will see approximately $15 million of fixed cost savings. 
Going forward, we expect that this strategic realignment will yield better and more stable results consistent with CenterPoint's investment thesis. Moreover, we continue to see viable investment opportunities at CES' intrastate pipeline through customer interconnects as the growth appears to be very robust in the petrochemical and other energy-intensive industries in the Gulf Coast. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress. We believe the business has turned the corner to once again become a contributor to CenterPoint Energy's earnings growth. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Gary Whitlock, Executive Vice President and CFO."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I'd like to provide you with an update on the use of cash we received from the sale of the transition bonds in January. As I mentioned last quarter,",432,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I'd like to provide you with an update on the use of cash we received from the sale of the transition bonds in January. As I mentioned last quarter, in addition to paying off our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of approximately $200 million, we reacquired tax exempt debt as a parent company with a principal amount of $375 million, and a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. In addition to these actions on April 1, we retired approximately $46 million of maturing tax exempt debt in Houston Electric with a coupon of 3.625%. In total, we have paid down debt by more than $600 million, which will result in a reduction in interest expense in 2012 of approximately $19 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Our objective for the remaining $1-plus billion in cash is to have our businesses invest the money in accretive, long-term projects and we are working diligently to do so. 
We continue to receive questions about our financing strategy for our midstream business, especially whether or not we intend to form an MLP. As we have previously said, the key variable for us is ensuring that we have visible long-term growth opportunities that merit the formation and use of an MLP. 
Now let me discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our estimate for earnings in the range of $1.08 to $1.20 per diluted share. As previously discussed, we have developed our earnings guidance range by using a number of variables such as commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. Clearly, the extremely mild winter weather and low natural gas prices have been negatives to earnings in the first quarter. On the other hand, the earnings performance of Houston Electric and a lower effective tax rate have been positive. We have taken into account the benefit of the debt reductions I mentioned earlier. However, we have not assumed any additional uses of our cash in developing these earnings range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
And finally, I would like to remind you of the 0.2025 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 26. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence of the Board of Directors in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will discuss our consolidated results for the first quarter of 2012. As a change to what we have done in prior quarters, I have asked our business unit leadership, Scott Prochazka, Tracy Bridge, Greg Harper and Joe McGoldrick to provide comments on their respective units performance in the quarter and give their perspectives on trends and expectations for their businesses. And finally, Gary will provide an update on a few items including guidance. 
We had a solid first quarter given the extremely mild winter weather and low natural gas prices. This morning, we reported net income of $147 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $148 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the same period of 2011. Operating income for the first quarter of 2012 was $338 million compared to $364 million for the same period last year. Our gas distribution unit, and to a lesser extent, our Competitive Gas Sales and Services business, were impacted by the mild winter weather. Houston Electric had a very solid quarter, and our midstream businesses met expectations. The diversity of our portfolio certainly helped maintain our earnings this quarter. I'll now ask each of our business unit heads to give more detail around their earnings and prospects. We'll start with Scott Prochazka, the President of our Electric Operations."

Houston Electric's first quarter performance was excellent. This year's operating income exceeded the first quarter of last year despite mild weather and the impact of rates implemented last September, which",605,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Houston Electric's first quarter performance was excellent. This year's operating income exceeded the first quarter of last year despite mild weather and the impact of rates implemented last September, which reduced operating income by $11 million. Revenues were bolstered by continued customer growth, a modest increase in usage, return associated with the recovery of true-up proceeds, and increased ancillary revenues, primarily from right-of-way leases. Altogether, the quarter was $2 million favorable to last year. 
We serve one of the most vibrant areas in the nation and the prospects for Houston Electric are exciting. We continue to enjoy a growing service territory with more than 42,000 customers added since the first quarter of last year. More than 93,000 jobs were added during the 12 months ending in February of 2012. And this rate of growth is projected to continue throughout the rest of the year. The Houston unemployment rate is currently 7.2%, down from a peak of 8.8%. Houston is the fourth largest city and the fifth most populous metropolitan area in the country. And the population growth rate of 2% is expected to continue for the next several years. 
Another key driver of growth is low natural gas prices, which support expansion in our refining, base chemicals and downstream products industries. These new facilities will require transmission and substation investments to serve a growing power requirement. Additionally, in response to the Panama Canal widening, facilities at or near the port of Houston are being expanded to accommodate an increase in cargo movement. This will bring general, commercial and industrial growth, as well as direct low growth associated with the installation of new, larger electric short range [ph] . 
Commercial development is also strengthening. Our world-class medical center continues to grow with the addition of 2 million square feet by the end of 2014. Additionally, new multipurpose campuses are being developed, such as the new ExxonMobil corporate campus and nearby development, that will include 5,000 homes along with 10 million square feet of commercial office and retail space. 
From a reliability standpoint, we are continuing our efforts to strengthen the grid by modifying our practices around pole management, circuit inspection, vegetation management and new construction. Further, we are adding operating and control infrastructure that will provide essential redundancy and comply with new federal regulations. 
By midyear of 2012, we will complete our advanced metering system deployment. This has been a very successful project with relatively few issues and no significant delays. To address the growing infrastructure needs of the Houston service territory, our capital investments will remain robust. Even with our advanced metering project drawing to a close, annual capital expenditures are projected to average over $500 million per year for the next 5 years, leading to a 4% annualized growth and rate base. As you may recall, last summer was Houston's hottest on record and this winter was the mildest in over 50 years. So it is unlikely that Houston Electric will equal its 2011 performance. In addition, the adverse impact of the rate case implemented last September will be experienced for the full year in 2012. However, with the benefit of strong growth, ongoing cost management, transmission cost recovery filings and additional ancillary revenues, we expect Houston Electric to have a good year and return its authorized rate of return. Since we now have capital trackers in place for both distribution and transmission investment, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case for the next several years. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tracy Bridge, President of our Gas Distribution business."
279513,183283589,297161,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. For our gas LDCs, this quarter was all about weather. Although our first quarter revenues were approximately $52 million lower than the first quarter of last year due to weather, we were able to mitigate $28 million of",537,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning. For our gas LDCs, this quarter was all about weather. Although our first quarter revenues were approximately $52 million lower than the first quarter of last year due to weather, we were able to mitigate $28 million of that impact through weather normalization adjustments or weather hedges. When compared to normal, the weather impact was approximately $42 million, which was mitigated by $22 million through these mechanisms. Operation and maintenance expenses were favorable to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to $5 million of reduced bad debt expense. Our credit and collection practices, along with low natural gas prices and mild weather, continued to reduce bad debt expense and we are working diligently on expense management across our business unit. Our service areas continue to grow with more than 13,000 customers added since the first quarter of last year. 
As Scott mentioned, Houston is a growing service territory. We are also experiencing growth in other areas of Texas, as well as in Minnesota and Mississippi. Unemployment rates are flat-to-down and housing starts are up from a year ago in all 6 states where we operate. Improved operations and customer service continue to be top priorities. We expect to benefit from efficiencies gained from technology advances and utility operations. For example, we are deploying advanced metering technology in our Houston, Texas Coast and South Texas service areas, which will increase productivity by allowing us to read 10,000 meters per vehicle per day compared to 500 meters per person per day. We are very focused on serving our customers more efficiently and effectively and we continue to expand our conservation improvement programs. 
We implemented a number of customer self-service options that allow greater automation and faster service. We believe these types of efforts are paying off. We recently earned the second highest score in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for investor-owned gas and electric utilities in the U.S. and a first place ranking in the midwest region of the J.D. Power Annual Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey for gas utilities. System safety and reliability also remain a top priority. As David mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we expect capital expenditures to exceed $350 million a year over the next 5 years, a significant increase over the historical run rate of about $200 million a year for this business unit. These increases in capital expenditures are primarily related to distribution system upgrades and will result in annual rate base growth of over 6%. 
Similar to the mechanisms Scott mentioned for Houston Electric, we also have rate adjustment mechanisms in place in several jurisdictions that allow more timely recovery of capital costs. One such mechanism is the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program, or G.R.I.P., available in Texas. The law provides for annual filings and we recently made GRIP filings in both our Houston and South Texas jurisdictions, requesting a combined $12 million increase in annual revenues. These new rates will begin in July 2012. 
In summary, we will continue to focus on expense management and employee rate adjustment mechanisms to mitigate the significant impacts of weather to date. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg Harper, Group President of Pipelines and Field Services."
279513,183283589,297161,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Low gas prices were the story in the midstream business, but our pipeline performed as expected and our Field Services unit continues to grow. Let me begin with our Pipelines business. Operating income was $60 million, a decline of $16 m",1236,"Thank you, Tracy. Low gas prices were the story in the midstream business, but our pipeline performed as expected and our Field Services unit continues to grow. Let me begin with our Pipelines business. Operating income was $60 million, a decline of $16 million from the first quarter of 2011. Total revenues of $13 million were due primarily to the expiration of a backhaul agreement on our Carthage to Perryville pipeline in midyear 2011. The warm winter also affected loads across our system with lower than normal and considerably lower than the first quarter of last year. Low gas prices and significantly compressed basis spreads adversely affected our office and sales. The combined effect of these 2 factors produced about a $3 million decline compared to the same quarter last year. We don't expect that pattern to change much until we see a return of locational basis spreads and gas price volatility in our market areas. 
On a positive note, we saw improved results in our ancillary services, which increased by about $3 million over the first quarter 2011. As you may know, ancillary services include natural gas processing and treating, as well as balancing services like park and loans or PALS. Processing margins continue to be strong due to an increase in volumes of high BTU content gas coming into our pipelines from liquids-rich plays in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana. PALS also provided improved results in the first quarter. 
As you may recall, we restructured and extended our agreements with our natural gas distribution facilities in 2010. Due to the seasonal structure in these agreements, results for the first quarter of 2012 led to increase of about $4 million compared to the same quarter last year. These agreements became effective in March 2011. And so for the balance of this year, we expect comparable results to last year. 
Our operations and maintenance expenses increased by about $7 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. However, last year's result included the favorable settlement of an insurance claim that reduced our operations and maintenance fixed messages [ph]  By about $4 million. Equity earnings from our investment in the Southeast Supply Header, a joint venture with Spectra, was $6 million in 2012, a $2 million increase from the first quarter of the prior year. A restructured and extended contract with an anchor shipper near the end of 2011 will result in an improvement in SESH's 2012 operating results. 
Now I'll turn to the Field Services first quarter results. Operating income from our Field Services business increased by $11 million to $47 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. Despite low natural gas prices, our revenues and margins remained strong, clearly highlighting the value of our fee-based contracting strategy, which emphasizes volume commitments and guarantee returns on our capital deployed. Total gathering volumes for the quarter increased by nearly 30% or 237 billion cubic feet in 2012 across our entire gathering network. More than 70% of those volumes came from the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford shale plays. Average daily throughput across our system grew 2.6 billion cubic feet per day for the quarter compared to 2 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter of 2011. Volumes from our Haynesville Shale gathering system in North Louisiana averaged over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2012. These volumes reflect throughput from shale and Encana production, as well as third-party shippers on the systems and is slightly down from the fourth quarter. But the higher margins from the increasing gathering throughput was partially offset by significant decline in natural gas prices, which reduced our margins for sales of retained natural gas by approximately $6 million compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Our average realized price for gas was nearly $1.25 lower than the first quarter 2011 and nearly $0.50 lower than last quarter. These low gas prices, if sustained, will adversely impact our full-year results. 
Operation and maintenance expenses declined primarily as a result of ongoing efforts to reduce rental expenses for compression and treating facilities. However, new assets put into place to replace these rentals, combined with new facilities built handoff [ph]  Haynesville shale growth resulted in increases and depreciation and taxes other than income. Late last year, Waskom, our processing joint venture, placed a 30 million -- 35 million cubic feet per day client [ph]  Expansion into service that included greater liquids offloading capabilities, a new rail loading facility, which provides greater access to premium liquids markets for Waskom customers. Equity earnings from our 50% share of Waskom were $3 million, an increase of $1 million over the first quarter of 2011. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss what the midstream businesses are focused on this year. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing significant activity in the liquids-rich natural gas areas. Both at pipelines and at self services we are actively pursuing several opportunities in and around our footprint including the Cana/Woodford in Western Oklahoma, the Mississippi Lime in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas, and the Cotton Valley play in East Texas. 
We have a presence near this place, as well as access to end-use markets and to the Perryville hub, which we believe makes us an attractive option to the producers developing these areas. Our pipelines are also well positioned to capture opportunities from power generation customers. There are 22 gas-fired power plants currently attached to our system, of which, more than half are under contract for firm services in excess of 800 million cubic feet per day. We're in active discussions to increase contracted levels as gas power generation becomes more of a base load rather than a peaking load for the electric power markets. 
We recently vowed to amend our Centerpoint Energy gas transmission tariff with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow our customers to choose the Perryville hub as a delivery and receipt point rather than specific points within the hub. Concurrently, we filed the application with the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, to make the Perryville hub a trading point for ICE transactions. We believe our customers will find it beneficial to be able to use ICE to settle their physical transactions. These actions, along with the fact that we have significant interconnectivity with other pipelines and storage assets within the hub, will provide our customers with added flexibility. 
In addition, we continue to develop great strategies for our 2 interstate pipelines. More specifically, in order to address the increased costs on our pipeline today, we have initiated a settlement process with customers for a new tariff structure on our Mississippi river transmission pipeline. This proposed rate structure will not only update our cost of service, but provides a tracking mechanism for recovering costs associated with environmental and safety regulations. 
Much like our Pipeline group, our Field Services group is pursuing liquid-rich opportunities within the reach of our gathering and processing footprint. We are also finding that the current low gas price environment is presenting new opportunities to acquire producer-owned gathering systems, as well as to partner with producers as they conduct their initial development in new shale plays. We recognize that we're currently operating in a challenging natural gas environment. However, we're pleased with the overall performance for our midstream business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick, President of our Competitive Energy Services business."

Our Energy Services business had an active quarter in which we positioned the business for the future. After adjusting for the timing-related variances of mark-to-market accounting and the write-down of inventory to lower of cost or market, operating income declined by $6 million from the same quarter of last year. Two major contributors to the decline were the mild weather and the low gas prices as discussed by the other business presidents. The mild weather caused lower usage by our commercial customers and the low gas price, low volatility market environment had the effect of compressing unit margins. 
Although the financial results were down, it was not unexpected, and there were several positive developments during the quarter. First, margins from seasonal storage spreads have improved and we should realize better fourth quarter results. For example, margins that averaged $0.50 to $0.60 per MMBTU last year are averaging $0.70 to $0.80 this year with some recent deals exceeding $1. Next, the strategic repositioning we implemented last year is gaining traction. That strategy involved a greater focus in growing our retail business and a corresponding reduction of fixed costs by rightsizing our pipeline transportation capacity used to serve retail customers. As an indicator of our progress, our retail commercial business grew in both customer additions and throughput in the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We added over 2,500 customers since the first quarter of last year, a 21% increase. 1,400 of the new customers came from an acquisition we made late last year and 1,100 from our existing markets. Also, through our fixed cost reduction strategy, we have either not renewed or negotiated early releases of uneconomic capacity. These actions will reduce our fixed costs and improve our margins as the year progresses. In 2012 alone, we will see approximately $15 million of fixed cost savings. 
Going forward, we expect that this strategic realignment will yield better and more stable results consistent with CenterPoint's investment thesis. Moreover, we continue to see viable investment opportunities at CES' intrastate pipeline through customer interconnects as the growth appears to be very robust in the petrochemical and other energy-intensive industries on the Gulf Coast. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress. We believe the business has turned the corner to once again become a contributor to CenterPoint Energy's earnings growth. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Gary Whitlock, Executive Vice President and CFO."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I'd like to provide you with an update on the use of cash we received from the sale of the transition bonds in January. As I mentioned last quarter,",432,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I'd like to provide you with an update on the use of cash we received from the sale of the transition bonds in January. As I mentioned last quarter, in addition to paying off our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of approximately $200 million, we reacquired tax exempt debt as a parent company with a principal amount of $375 million, and a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. In addition to these actions on April 1, we retired approximately $46 million of maturing tax exempt debt in Houston Electric with a coupon of 3.625%. In total, we have paid down debt by more than $600 million, which will result in a reduction in interest expense in 2012 of approximately $19 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Our objective for the remaining $1-plus billion in cash is to have our businesses invest the money in accretive, long-term projects and we are working diligently to do so. 
We continue to receive questions about our financing strategy for our midstream business, especially whether or not we intend to form an MLP. As we have previously said, the key variable for us is ensuring that we have visible long-term growth opportunities that merit the formation and use of an MLP. 
Now let me discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our estimate for earnings in the range of $1.08 to $1.20 per diluted share. As previously discussed, we have developed our earnings guidance range by using a number of variables such as commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceedings and our effective tax rate. Clearly, the extremely mild winter weather and low natural gas prices have been negatives to earnings in the first quarter. On the other hand, the earnings performance of Houston Electric and a lower effective tax rate have been positive. We have taken into account the benefit of the debt reductions I mentioned earlier. However, we have not assumed any additional uses of our cash in developing these earnings range. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. 
And finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on April 26. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence of the Board of Directors in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both of financial and operating standpoint. This morning, we reported net income of $126 million or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $119 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2011.
Operating income for the second quarter was $302 million compared to $303 million last year. Houston Electric had a solid quarter despite milder weather compared to 2011. We reported operating income of $153 million, which was the same as the second quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited from the growth of more than 43,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which we believe will continue for the remainder of the year.
We also benefited from the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's recovery of true-up proceeds and an increase in miscellaneous revenues primarily from grants of right-of-way easements. Offsetting this benefit was the $15 million impact from that rate changes implemented in September of 2011 and higher net transmission costs.
In May, Houston Electric substantially completed the deployment of our advanced metering system, having installed approximately 2.2 million smart meters. We completed this $660 million project on time and on budget, and I'm very proud of the many employees who contributed to the success of this deployment.
Houston Electric is now focused on implementing our intelligent grid project, which will bring substantial automation and new functionality to our distribution system. This project, other system improvements and robust growth in our Houston service territory should drive capital expenditures of $500 million to $600 million per year, contributing to rate base growth of approximately 4% annually.
Our Natural Gas Distribution business reporting -- reported $9 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2012, which was $4 million less than last year, primarily due to the impacts of milder weather. We continue to focus on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of extremely mild weather this year. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recovery new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage, without the necessity of our major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag, which we would typically experience.
We also continue to be focused on system reliability due to the replacement of infrastructure, as well as upgrading our systems to enhance service to our customers. These investments, together with normal low growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $300 million to $400 million annually and produce rate base growth of approximately 6% a year.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $52 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of an expired backhaul contract and the associated loss of compressor efficiency. We continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines, with special focus on power generation customers and producers in Western Oklahoma looking for access to interstate markets.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectrum, was $6 million compared to $5 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract started in January of this year.
Our Field Services unit reported operating income of $51 million compared to $39 million for the same quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale plays, partially offset by lower prices that we received from selling retained gas.
Gathering throughput increased approximately 18% compared to the second quarter of last year, but it declined about 2% since last quarter. We expect our overall system throughput to average approximately 2.6 billion cubic feet per day through 2012. 
As we have discussed in the past, our investments in the shale plays are backed by throughput, our rate of return guarantees, which reduce our sensitivity to throughput volumes.
In our largest gathering area, Haynesville, our producer customers have a backlog of well completions and 1 rig operating. Based on their guidance, we expect Haynesville throughput to remain about 1 Bcf per day for the remainder of the year. Additionally, since we have moved from the construction phase to full operating phase in the Haynesville, we are realizing better efficiency and expense management.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities compared to $3 million last year. This quarter, Waskom experienced lower volumes due to upstream supply disruptions and lower commodity prices.
Greg will discuss the details of our 2 recent midstream acquisitions in a few minutes.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported an operating loss of $4 million compared to operating income of $3 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, results for the second quarter of 2012 increased $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2011.
We experienced increases in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to beyond the expansion of our commercial and industrial customer base, rationalizing our fixed cost and increasing our product and service offerings.
In summary, despite the mild impact of mild weather and a challenging energy environment, the company delivered solid operating and financial results. I think this once again demonstrates the value of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses.
Now let me turn to the use of the remaining true-up proceeds. In our last call, I indicated I would provide clarity around the use of these funds. Since that time, we have invested over $360 million in 2 midstream acquisitions, bringing the total use of the true-up proceeds to about $1 billion after taking into account the debt reductions we made earlier this year.
The 2 recent acquisitions have boosted our confidence that we can successfully execute on attractive midstream opportunities in this highly competitive market. We are currently in active discussions with producers in the Mississippi Lime, Cana/Woodford and Tuscaloosa Marine shale plays to build new gathering and processing facilities for natural gas and crude oil production.
In several cases, we are responding to RFPs by these producers. We have also had some success in getting into areas out outside our Mid-Continent footprint. Pursuant to a letter of intent with a major producer, we recently began preliminary survey and right-of-way work for a potential crude gathering system in the Bakken shale. Our goal is to execute a gathering agreement with them by year-end.
Besides these midstream opportunities, we are very interested in expanding our regulated investments and believe it is important to maintain a balanced of regulated and nonregulated assets. Given these opportunities, we have no plans for a stock buyback at this time. We believe we can deploy the remaining proceeds in good investment opportunities over the next 18 months or so.
Let me conclude by discussing our recent change in our Executive management team. Earlier this week, we named Scott Prochazka to a newly formed position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In his new capacity, Scott will be a member of the company's Executive Committee and each of our business units will report to him. In turn, we will report to me. Scott has been with CenterPoint since 2001. He's most recent assignment was the President of Houston Electric. He's also served in leadership roles in strategic planning, customer service and gas distribution. Prior to coming to CenterPoint, he spent 12 years at Dow Chemical. Scott has an excellent mix of both regulated and unregulated business experienced. While Scott has not previously had operational responsibilities in the midstream businesses, he shares my views of the importance of these businesses to the overall CenterPoint portfolio.
Scott will be a great contributor, as we strive to go our regulated and competitive businesses and enhance the value of CenterPoint to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning, in our earnings release, we increased our earnings estimate to the range of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. This is up from previously provided guidance of $1.08 to $1.20 per diluted share.
This revision in guidance reflect an increase in earnings for 2012 of approximately $0.03 per diluted share associated with our 2 recent midstream acquisitions. Greg will discuss these acquisitions and their earnings potential in more detail in his comments.
In addition to the items I just mentioned, we have developed our earnings guidance range based on performance to date and by using a number of variables that may impact earnings such as commodity prices, throughput volume, weather, regulatory proceedings and effective tax rate.
We have taken into account the benefit of debt reduction. However, we have not assumed additional earnings from the use of the remaining cash. Our revised guidance excludes a nonrecurring pretax gain of approximately $130 million. This then will be recorded in the third quarter and is the result of remeasuring to fair value of our regional 50% interest in the Waskom assets.
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings outlook.
We continue to receive questions about the financing strategy of our midstream business, especially whether or not we have made the decision to form an MLP. We have $600 million to $700 million of available cash on hand, so there is no immediate need for financing. However, our confidence in our ability to make midstream investments over the long term continues to increase, and I expect this unit will ultimately need financing to support its expanding activity.
Significant ongoing investments will make an MLP attractive. Of course, the capital and financing requirements of the company's other subsidiaries will play a role in this decision as well.
Also, I wanted to mention that last week, we were very pleased to learn that Moody's upgraded the ratings outlook of both the parent company and Houston Electric from stable to positive. This is a reflection of the consistent improvement in our credit metrics in the overall strength of the company -- financial strength of the company.
We look forward to building from our strong base of assets and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders. Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors on July 25. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I'm pleased to report on 2 recent acquisitions that provide near-term journeys benefits, as Gary mentioned, but more importantly, position our Field Services and interstate pipeline businesses very well for the future.
First, you may recall that in June, we signed an agreement with market midstream to acquire their 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture assets and several of the present gas assets for approximately $275 million. This transaction closed on July 31, and we now own 100% of Waskom and are the operator of the facility.
The purchase also includes processing system and 3 smaller gathering systems in [indiscernible] The Waskom assets include a recently expanded 320 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility with 14,500 barrels a day of fractionation capacity, along with the Harrison gathering system, a 75 million cubic feet per day gathering system connect to the Waskom plant.
30 million cubic feet per day gathering and processing system located in Harrison County, Texas. With 3 smaller gathering systems combined to gather and treat more than 40 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and are located near our other newly acquired assets in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana.
The majority of the throughput from the new gathering systems is connected to the Waskom plant with access to its extensive natural gas liquids markets in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent pipeline infrastructure. This acquisition, which positions us as the operator of key processing assets will provide some significant boost to our commercial efforts in that area.
In particular, we have seen an increase in producer activity due to the improved economics of producing liquids-rich natural gas in the Cotton Valley field, as well as Cotton Valley filled, as well as other nearby formations, which is expected to enhance the inlet stream into the Waskom plant.
Waskom provides the competitive market for natural gas liquids without the additional cost of transportation to the fractionation at Mont Belvieu. Waskom also provide several takeaway options for natural gas, including our CGP pipeline and access to our pipeline and our Pearl Harbor hub.
Furthermore, the railroad loading facility that was completed in late 2011 provides our customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids market. In our new role as owner and operator of the prison facilities in conjunction with our existing assets in the area, we expect to realize significant commercial and operational synergies.
Additionally, in May, we acquired Encana's gathering and treating assets for approximately $89 million. Concurrently, we entered into a long-term gathering agreement for the Amoroso and Hilltop production located in Robertson Counties in East Texas. Encana has been an excellent partner for us since we entered our first agreement with them in the Haynesville Shale in September of 2009. The gathering agreement has a term of 15 years and includes an initial commitment, as well as dedication production from recovered area.
The contract also provides a guaranteed return on all future capital deployed to gather production within the dedicated acreage. While drilling as right as areas like this one has slowed recently, the contracted volume commitments alone provide returns that meets our investment criteria. However, the ultimate recoverable reserves are significant in a dedicated area. And when drilling levels will improve, we will been a great position to benefit from the increased production.
As important, this transaction gives us a presence in the area and allows us to pursue liquids-rich and crude oil plays that business are developing in the part of East Texas.
Now let me address the transactions from a financial perspective. With the synergies anticipate to cut through the prism assets, the increasing liquids-rich volumes at the Waskom plant and our producers current production profiles, we estimate that we paid approximately 7x 2013 EBITDA with Amoroso and Prism assets combined. On an operating income basis, we expect Amoroso to contribute $9 million to $12 million per year over the next several years and Prism to contribute $28 million to $33 million of operating income per year.
Finally, the Prism and Amoroso assets in conjunction with the existing assets in our footprint, strategically positions as the key gathering processing and transportation service provider in the region serving as a foundation for significant growth in the years ahead.
Now let me turn the call over to Carla."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both a financial and operating standpoint",1369,"Thank you, Carla. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both a financial and operating standpoint. This morning, we reported net income of $126 million or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $119 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2011.
Operating income for the second quarter was $302 million compared to $303 million last year. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, despite milder weather, compared to 2011. We reported operating income of $153 million, which was the same as the second quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited from the growth of more than 43,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which we believe will continue for the remainder of the year.
We also benefited from the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's recovery of true-up proceeds, and an increase in miscellaneous revenues, primarily from grants of right-of-way easements. Offsetting these benefit was a $15 million impact from the rate changes implemented in September 2011, and higher net transmission cost.
In May, Houston Electric substantially completed the deployment of our advanced metering system, having installed approximately 2.2 million smart meters. We completed this $660 million project, on time and on budget, and I'm very proud of the many employees who contributed to the success of this deployment.  
Houston Electric is now focused on implementing our intelligent grid project, which will bring substantial automation and new functionality to our distribution system. This project, other system improvements and robust growth in our Houston service territory should drive capital expenditures of $500 million to $600 million per year, contributing to rate base growth of approximately 4% annually.
Our natural gas distribution business reporting -- reported $9 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2012, which was $4 million less than last year, primarily due to the impacts of milder weather. We continue to focus on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of extremely mild weather this year. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recovery new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage, without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag which we would typically experience.
We also continue to be focused on system reliability, due to the replacement of infrastructure, as well as upgrading our systems to enhance service to our customers. These investments, together with normal load growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $300 million to $400 million annually and produce rate-based growth of approximately 6% a year.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $52 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of an expired backhaul contract and the associated loss of compressor efficiency. We continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines, with special focus on power generation customers and producers in Western Oklahoma looking for access to interstate markets.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $6 million compared to $5 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract started in January of this year.
Our field services unit reported operating income of $51 million compared to $39 million for the same quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale plays, partially offset by lower prices that we received from selling retained gas.
Gathering throughput increased approximately 18% compared to the second quarter of last year, but it declined about 2% since last quarter. We expect our overall system throughput to average approximately 2.6 billion cubic feet per day through 2012.
As we have discussed in the past, our investment in the shale plays are backed by throughput, our rate-of-return guarantees, which reduce our sensitivity to throughput volumes. In our largest gathering area, Haynesville, our producer/customers have a backlog of well completions and 1 rig operating. Based on their guidance, we expect Haynesville throughput to remain about 1 Bcf per day for the remainder of the year. Additionally, since we have moved from the construction phase to full operating phase in the Haynesville, we are realizing better efficiency and expense management.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities, compared to $3 million last year. This quarter, Waskom experienced lower volumes due to upstream supply disruptions and lower commodity prices.
Greg will discuss the details of our 2 recent midstream acquisitions in a few minutes.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services business reported an operating loss of $4 million compared to operating income of $3 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, results for the second quarter of 2012 increased $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. We experienced increases in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to beyond the expansion of our commercial and industrial customer base, rationalizing our fixed cost and increasing our product and service offerings.
In summary, despite the mild impact of mild weather and a challenging energy environment, the company delivered solid operating and financial results. I think this, once again, demonstrates the value of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses.
Now let me turn to the use of the remaining true-up proceeds. In our last call, I indicated I would provide clarity around the use of these funds. Since that time, we have invested over $360 million in 2 midstream acquisitions, bringing the total use of the true-up proceeds to about $1 billion after taking into account the debt reductions we made earlier this year.
The 2 recent acquisitions have boosted our confidence that we can successfully execute on attractive midstream opportunities in this highly competitive market. We are currently in active discussions with producers in the Mississippi Lime, Cana/Woodford and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale plays to build new gathering and processing facilities for natural gas and crude oil production.  In several cases, we are responding to RFPs by these producers. 
We have also had some success in getting into areas out outside our Mid-Continent footprint. Pursuant to a letter of intent with a major producer, we recently began preliminary survey and right-of-way work for a potential crude gathering system in the Bakken Shale. Our goal is to execute a gathering agreement with them by year-end.
Besides these midstream opportunities, we are very interested in expanding our regulated investments, and believe it is important to maintain a balance of regulated and nonregulated assets. Given these opportunities, we have no plans for a stock buyback at this time. We believe we can deploy the remaining proceeds in good investment opportunities over the next 18 months or so.
Let me conclude by discussing a recent change in our Executive management team. Earlier this week, we named Scott Prochazka to a newly formed position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In his new capacity, Scott will be a member of the company's Executive Committee and each of our business units will report to him. In turn, we will report to me. Scott has been with CenterPoint since 2001. His most recent assignment was the President of Houston Electric. He has also served in leadership roles in strategic planning, customer service and gas distribution. Prior to coming to CenterPoint, he spent 12 years at Dow Chemical. Scott has an excellent mix of both regulated and unregulated business experience. While Scott has not previously had operational responsibilities in the midstream businesses, he shares my views of the importance of these businesses to the overall CenterPoint portfolio. Scott will be a great contributor, as we strive to go our regulated and competitive businesses and enhance the value of CenterPoint to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning, in our earnings release, we increased our earnings estimate to the range of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. This is up from previously provided guidance of $1.08 to $1.20 per diluted share. This revision in guidance reflects an increase in earnings for 2012 of approximately $0.03 per diluted share associated with our 2 recent midstream acquisitions. Greg will describe these acquisitions and their earnings potential in more detail in his comments.
In addition to the items I just mentioned, we have developed our earnings guidance range, based on performance to date, and by using a number of variables that may impact earnings such as commodity prices, throughput volume, weather, regulatory proceedings and effective tax rate. We have taken into account the benefit of debt reduction. However, we have not assumed additional earnings from the use of the remaining cash. Our revised guidance excludes a nonrecurring pretax gain of approximately $130 million. This gain will be recorded in the third quarter and is the result of remeasuring to fair value our regional 50% interest in the Waskom assets. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings outlook.
We continue to receive questions about the financing strategy of our midstream business, especially whether or not we have made the decision to form an MLP. We have $600 million to $700 million of available cash on hand, so there is no immediate need for financing. However, our confidence in our ability to make midstream investments over the long term continues to increase, and I expect this unit will ultimately need financing to support its expanding activities. Significant ongoing investments would make an MLP attractive. Of course, the capital and financing requirements of the company's other subsidiaries will play a role in this decision as well.
Also, I wanted to mention that last week we were very pleased to learn that Moody's upgraded the ratings outlook of both the parent company and Houston Electric from stable to positive. This is a reflection of the consistent improvement in our credit metrics and the overall strength of the company -- financial strength of the company. We look forward to building from our strong base of assets and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share dividend declared by the Board of Directors on July 25. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors have in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.

I'm pleased to report on 2 recent acquisitions that only provide near-term earnings benefits, as Gary mentioned, but more importantly, position our field services and interstate pipeline businesses very well for the future.
First, you may recall that in June, we signed an agreement with Martin Midstream to acquire their 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture asset, and several of the Prism Gas assets for approximately $275 million. This transaction closed on July 31, and we now own 100% of Waskom and are the operator of the facility. The purchase also includes Prism's Woodlawn gathering and processing system, and 3 smaller gathering systems: Mcleod, Hallsville and Darco. The Waskom assets include a recently expanded 320 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, with 14,500 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. Along with the Harrison gathering system, a 75 million cubic feet per day gathering system connect to the Waskom plant.
Fleet Long [ph] is a 30 million cubic feet per day gathering and processing system located in Harrison County, Texas, with 3 smaller gathering systems combined to gather and treat more than 40 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, and are located near our other newly acquired assets in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana.
The majority of the throughput from the new gathering systems is connected to the Waskom plant with access to its extensive natural gas liquids markets in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent pipeline infrastructure. This acquisition, which positions us as the operator of key processing assets will provide a significant boost to our commercial efforts in the area. In particular, we have seen an increase in producer activity, due to the improved economics of producing liquids-rich natural gas in the Cotton Valley field, as well as other nearby formations, which is expected to enhance the inlet stream into the Waskom plant. Waskom provides a competitive market for natural gas liquids without the additional cost of transportation to the fractionation at Mont Belvieu. Waskom also provides several takeaway options for natural gas, including our CEGT pipeline and access to our Carthage to Perryville pipeline and our Perryville hub.  Furthermore, the railroad loading facility, that was completed in late 2011, provides our customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids markets. In our new role as owner and operator of the Prism facilities in conjunction with our existing assets in the area, we expect to realize significant commercial and operational synergies.
Additionally, in May, we acquired Encana's Amoruso gathering and treating assets for approximately $89 million. Concurrently, we entered into a long-term gathering agreement for the Amoruso and Hilltop field production located in Robertson and Leon Counties in East Texas.
Encana has been an excellent partner for us since we entered our first agreement with them in the Haynesville Shale in September of 2009. The gathering agreement has a term of 15 years and includes an initial volume commitment, as well as a dedication of Encana's production from the covered area. The contract also provides a guaranteed return on all future capital deployed to gather production within the dedicated acreage.
So, while drilling in dry gas areas like this one has slowed recently, the contracted volume commitments alone provide returns that meets our investment criteria. However, the ultimate recoverable reserves are significant in the dedicated area, and when drilling levels improve, we will been a great position to benefit from the increased production. As important, this transaction gives us a presence in the area and allows us to pursue liquids-rich and crude oil plays that producers are developing in that part of East Texas.
Now, let me address the transactions from a financial perspective. With the synergies we anticipate to capture through the Prism assets, the increase in liquids-rich volumes we expect at the Waskom plant and our producers current production profiles, we estimate that we paid approximately 7x 2013 EBITDA for with Amoruso and Prism assets combined. On an operating income basis, we expect Amoruso to contribute $9 million to $12 million per year over the next several years, and Prism to contribute $28 million to $33 million of operating income per year.
Finally, the Prism and Amoruso assets, in conjunction with the existing assets in our footprint, strategically positions as a key gathering, processing and transportation service provider in the region, serving as a foundation for significant growth in the years ahead.
Now let me turn the call over to Carla."

But I think David and I have addressed, on several calls before, that nearly 50% of the Waskom inlet is based on fee-based. And we also have the right, if liquids prices go extremely down, we have the right convert all of the volumes to fee-based. So the right balance, I think we have a right balance right now, what we're taking on. Again, the Amoruso transaction is a volume commitment transaction, so that gives us guaranteed revenues with that stream. So, I think, as we go and balance our field services portfolio, we're looking at solid fee-based investments with some, investments to have maybe a moderate level of commodity exposure."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both a financial and operating standpoint",1369,"Thank you, Carla. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both a financial and operating standpoint. This morning, we reported net income of $126 million or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $119 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2011.
Operating income for the second quarter was $302 million compared to $303 million last year. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, despite milder weather, compared to 2011. We reported operating income of $153 million, which was the same as the second quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited from the growth of more than 43,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which we believe will continue for the remainder of the year.
We also benefited from the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's recovery of true-up proceeds, and an increase in miscellaneous revenues, primarily from grants of right-of-way easements. Offsetting these benefits was a $15 million impact from the rate changes implemented in September 2011, and higher net transmission cost.
In May, Houston Electric substantially completed the deployment of our advanced metering system, having installed approximately 2.2 million smart meters. We completed this $660 million project, on time and on budget, and I'm very proud of the many employees who contributed to the success of this deployment.  
Houston Electric is now focused on implementing our intelligent grid project, which will bring substantial automation and new functionality to our distribution system. This project, other system improvements and robust growth in our Houston service territory should drive capital expenditures of $500 million to $600 million per year, contributing to rate base growth of approximately 4% annually.
Our natural gas distribution business reporting -- reported $9 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2012, which was $4 million less than last year, primarily due to the impacts of milder weather. We continue to focus on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of extremely mild weather this year. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage, without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag which we would typically experience.
We also continue to be focused on system reliability, due to the replacement of infrastructure, as well as upgrading our systems to enhance service to our customers. These investments, together with normal load growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $300 million to $400 million annually and produce rate-based growth of approximately 6% a year.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $52 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of an expired backhaul contract and the associated loss of compressor efficiency. We continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines, with special focus on power generation customers and producers in Western Oklahoma looking for access to interstate markets.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $6 million compared to $5 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract started in January of this year.
Our field services unit reported operating income of $51 million compared to $39 million for the same quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale plays, partially offset by lower prices that we received from selling retained gas.
Gathering throughput increased approximately 18% compared to the second quarter of last year, but it declined about 2% since last quarter. We expect our overall system throughput to average approximately 2.6 billion cubic feet per day through 2012.
As we have discussed in the past, our investment in the shale plays are backed by throughput, our rate-of-return guarantees, which reduce our sensitivity to throughput volumes. In our largest gathering area, Haynesville, our producer/customers have a backlog of well completions and 1 rig operating. Based on their guidance, we expect Haynesville throughput to remain about 1 Bcf per day for the remainder of the year. Additionally, since we have moved from the construction phase to full operating phase in the Haynesville, we are realizing better efficiency and expense management.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities, compared to $3 million last year. This quarter, Waskom experienced lower volumes due to upstream supply disruptions and lower commodity prices.
Greg will discuss the details of our 2 recent midstream acquisitions in a few minutes.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services business reported an operating loss of $4 million compared to operating income of $3 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, results for the second quarter of 2012 increased $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. We experienced increases in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to be on the expansion of our commercial and industrial customer base, rationalizing our fixed cost and increasing our product and service offerings.
In summary, despite the mild impact of mild weather and a challenging energy environment, the company delivered solid operating and financial results. I think this, once again, demonstrates the value of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses.
Now let me turn to the use of the remaining true-up proceeds. In our last call, I indicated I would provide clarity around the use of these funds. Since that time, we have invested over $360 million in 2 midstream acquisitions, bringing the total use of the true-up proceeds to about $1 billion after taking into account the debt reductions we made earlier this year.
The 2 recent acquisitions have boosted our confidence that we can successfully execute on attractive midstream opportunities in this highly competitive market. We are currently in active discussions with producers in the Mississippi Lime, Cana/Woodford and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale plays to build new gathering and processing facilities for natural gas and crude oil production. In several cases, we are responding to RFPs by these producers. 
We have also had some success in getting into areas outside our Mid-Continent footprint. Pursuant to a letter of intent with a major producer, we recently began preliminary survey and right-of-way work for a potential crude gathering system in the Bakken Shale. Our goal is to execute a gathering agreement with them by year-end.
Besides these midstream opportunities, we are very interested in expanding our regulated investments, and believe it is important to maintain a balance of regulated and unregulated assets. Given these opportunities, we have no plans for a stock buyback at this time. We believe we can deploy the remaining proceeds in good investment opportunities over the next 18 months or so.
Let me conclude by discussing a recent change in our Executive management team. Earlier this week, we named Scott Prochazka to a newly formed position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In his new capacity, Scott will be a member of the company's Executive Committee and each of our business units will report to him. In turn, he will report to me. Scott has been with CenterPoint since 2001. His most recent assignment was the President of Houston Electric. He has also served in leadership roles in strategic planning, customer service and gas distribution. Prior to coming to CenterPoint, he spent 12 years at Dow Chemical. Scott has an excellent mix of both regulated and unregulated business experience. While Scott has not previously had operational responsibilities in the midstream businesses, he shares my views of the importance of these businesses to the overall CenterPoint portfolio. Scott will be a great contributor, as we strive to grow our regulated and competitive businesses and enhance the value of CenterPoint to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. First, I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning, in our earnings release, we increased our earnings estimate to the range of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. This is up from previously provided guidance of $1.08 to $1.20 per diluted share. This revision in guidance reflects an increase in earnings for 2012 of approximately $0.03 per diluted share associated with our 2 recent midstream acquisitions. Greg will describe these acquisitions and their earnings potential in more detail in his comments.
In addition to the items I just mentioned, we have developed our earnings guidance range, based on performance to date, and by using a number of variables that may impact earnings such as commodity prices, throughput volume, weather, regulatory proceedings and effective tax rate. We have taken into account the benefit of debt reduction. However, we have not assumed additional earnings from the use of the remaining cash. Our revised guidance excludes a nonrecurring pretax gain of approximately $130 million. This gain will be recorded in the third quarter and is the result of remeasuring to fair value our regional 50% interest in the Waskom assets. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings outlook.
We continue to receive questions about the financing strategy of our midstream business, especially whether or not we have made a decision to form an MLP. We have $600 million to $700 million of available cash on hand, so there is no immediate need for financing. However, our confidence in our ability to make midstream investments over the long term continues to increase, and I expect this unit will ultimately need financing to support its expanding activities. Significant ongoing investments would make an MLP attractive. Of course, the capital and financing requirements of the company's other subsidiaries will play a role in this decision as well.
Also, I wanted to mention that last week we were very pleased to learn that Moody's upgraded the ratings outlook of both the parent company and Houston Electric from stable to positive. This is a reflection of the consistent improvement in our credit metrics and the overall strength of the company -- financial strength of the company. We look forward to building from our strong base of assets and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share dividend declared by the Board of Directors on July 25. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.

I'm pleased to report on 2 recent acquisitions that not only provide near-term earnings benefits, as Gary mentioned, but more importantly, position our field services and interstate pipeline businesses very well for the future.
First, you may recall that in June, we signed an agreement with Martin Midstream to acquire their 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture asset, and several of the Prism Gas assets for approximately $275 million. This transaction closed on July 31, and we now own 100% of Waskom and are the operator of the facility. The purchase also includes Prism's Woodlawn gathering and processing system, and 3 smaller gathering systems: Mcleod, Hallsville and Darco. The Waskom assets include a recently expanded 320 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, with 14,500 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. Along with the Harrison gathering system, a 75 million cubic feet per day gathering system connects to the Waskom plant.
Fleet Long [ph] is a 30 million cubic feet per day gathering and processing system located in Harrison County, Texas, with 3 smaller gathering systems combined to gather and treat more than 40 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, and are located near our other newly acquired assets in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana.
The majority of the throughput from the new gathering systems is connected to the Waskom plant with access to its extensive natural gas liquids markets in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent pipeline infrastructure. This acquisition, which positions us as the operator of key processing assets will provide a significant boost to our commercial efforts in the area. In particular, we have seen an increase in producer activity, due to the improved economics of producing liquids-rich natural gas in the Cotton Valley field, as well as other nearby formations, which is expected to enhance the inlet stream into the Waskom plant. Waskom provides a competitive market for natural gas liquids without the additional cost of transportation to the fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu. Waskom also provides several takeaway options for natural gas, including our CEGT pipeline and access to our Carthage to Perryville pipeline and our Perryville hub. Furthermore, the railroad loading facility, that was completed in late 2011, provides our customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids markets. In our new role as owner and operator of the Prism facilities in conjunction with our existing assets in the area, we expect to realize significant commercial and operational synergies.
Additionally, in May, we acquired Encana's Amoruso gathering and treating assets for approximately $89 million. Concurrently, we entered into a long-term gathering agreement for the Amoruso and Hilltop field production located in Robertson and Leon Counties in East Texas.
Encana has been an excellent partner for us since we entered our first agreement with them in the Haynesville Shale in September of 2009. The gathering agreement has a term of 15 years and includes an initial volume commitment, as well as a dedication of Encana's future production from the covered area. The contract also provides a guaranteed return on all future capital deployed to gather production within the dedicated acreage.
So, while drilling in dry gas areas like this one has slowed recently, the contracted volume commitments alone provide returns that meet our investment criteria. However, the ultimate recoverable reserves are significant in the dedicated area, and when drilling levels improve, we will been a great position to benefit from the increased production. As important, this transaction gives us a presence in the area and allows us to pursue liquids-rich and crude oil plays that producers are developing in that part of East Texas.
Now, let me address the transactions from a financial perspective. With the synergies we anticipate to capture through the Prism assets, the increase in liquids-rich volumes we expect at the Waskom plant and our producers current production profiles, we estimate that we paid approximately 7x 2013 EBITDA for the Amoruso and Prism assets combined. On an operating income basis, we expect Amoruso to contribute $9 million to $12 million per year over the next several years, and Prism to contribute $28 million to $33 million of operating income per year.
Finally, the Prism and Amoruso assets, in conjunction with the existing assets in our footprint, strategically positions us as a key gathering, processing and transportation service provider in the region, serving as a foundation for significant growth in the years ahead.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both a financial and operating standpoint",1369,"Thank you, Carla. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This quarter was a good one for the company. We had a solid quarter from both a financial and operating standpoint. This morning, we reported net income of $126 million or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $119 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2011.
Operating income for the second quarter was $302 million compared to $303 million last year. Houston Electric had a solid quarter, despite milder weather, compared to 2011. We reported operating income of $153 million, which was the same as the second quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited from the growth of more than 43,000 customers since the second quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which we believe will continue for the remainder of the year.
We also benefited from the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's recovery of true-up proceeds, and an increase in miscellaneous revenues, primarily from grants of right-of-way easements. Offsetting these benefits was a $15 million impact from the rate changes implemented in September 2011, and higher net transmission cost.
In May, Houston Electric substantially completed the deployment of our advanced metering system, having installed approximately 2.2 million smart meters. We completed this $660 million project, on time and on budget, and I'm very proud of the many employees who contributed to the success of this deployment.  
Houston Electric is now focused on implementing our intelligent grid project, which will bring substantial automation and new functionality to our distribution system. This project, other system improvements and robust growth in our Houston service territory should drive capital expenditures of $500 million to $600 million per year, contributing to rate base growth of approximately 4% annually.
Our natural gas distribution business reporting -- reported $9 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2012, which was $4 million less than last year, primarily due to the impacts of milder weather. We continue to focus on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of extremely mild weather this year. Annual rate adjustments in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage, without the necessity of a major rate proceeding. This significantly reduces the amount of regulatory lag which we would typically experience.
We also continue to be focused on system reliability, due to the replacement of infrastructure, as well as upgrading our systems to enhance service to our customers. These investments, together with normal load growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $300 million to $400 million annually and produce rate-based growth of approximately 6% a year.
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $52 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of an expired backhaul contract and the associated loss of compressor efficiency. We continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines, with special focus on power generation customers and producers in Western Oklahoma looking for access to interstate markets.
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $6 million compared to $5 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract started in January of this year.
Our field services unit reported operating income of $51 million compared to $39 million for the same quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of long-term agreements in the Haynesville and Fayetteville shale plays, partially offset by lower prices that we received from selling retained gas.
Gathering throughput increased approximately 18% compared to the second quarter of last year, but it declined about 2% since last quarter. We expect our overall system throughput to average approximately 2.6 billion cubic feet per day through 2012.
As we have discussed in the past, our investment in the shale plays are backed by throughput, our rate-of-return guarantees, which reduce our sensitivity to throughput volumes. In our largest gathering area, Haynesville, our producer/customers have a backlog of well completions and 1 rig operating. Based on their guidance, we expect Haynesville throughput to remain about 1 Bcf per day for the remainder of the year. Additionally, since we have moved from the construction phase to full operating phase in the Haynesville, we are realizing better efficiency and expense management.
In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $2 million from our jointly owned Waskom facilities, compared to $3 million last year. This quarter, Waskom experienced lower volumes due to upstream supply disruptions and lower commodity prices.
Greg will discuss the details of our 2 recent midstream acquisitions in a few minutes.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services business reported an operating loss of $4 million compared to operating income of $3 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting, results for the second quarter of 2012 increased $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. We experienced increases in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to be on the expansion of our commercial and industrial customer base, rationalizing our fixed cost and increasing our product and service offerings.
In summary, despite the mild impact of mild weather and a challenging energy environment, the company delivered solid operating and financial results. I think this, once again, demonstrates the value of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas businesses.
Now let me turn to the use of the remaining true-up proceeds. In our last call, I indicated I would provide clarity around the use of these funds. Since that time, we have invested over $360 million in 2 midstream acquisitions, bringing the total use of the true-up proceeds to about $1 billion after taking into account the debt reductions we made earlier this year.
The 2 recent acquisitions have boosted our confidence that we can successfully execute on attractive midstream opportunities in this highly competitive market. We are currently in active discussions with producers in the Mississippi Lime, Cana/Woodford and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale plays to build new gathering and processing facilities for natural gas and crude oil production. In several cases, we are responding to RFPs by these producers. 
We have also had some success in getting into areas outside our Mid-Continent footprint. Pursuant to a letter of intent with a major producer, we recently began preliminary survey and right-of-way work for a potential crude gathering system in the Bakken Shale. Our goal is to execute a gathering agreement with them by year-end.
Besides these midstream opportunities, we are very interested in expanding our regulated investments, and believe it is important to maintain a balance of regulated and unregulated assets. Given these opportunities, we have no plans for a stock buyback at this time. We believe we can deploy the remaining proceeds in good investment opportunities over the next 18 months or so.
Let me conclude by discussing a recent change in our Executive management team. Earlier this week, we named Scott Prochazka to a newly formed position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In his new capacity, Scott will be a member of the company's Executive Committee and each of our business units will report to him. In turn, he will report to me. Scott has been with CenterPoint since 2001. His most recent assignment was the President of Houston Electric. He has also served in leadership roles in strategic planning, customer service and gas distribution. Prior to coming to CenterPoint, he spent 12 years at Dow Chemical. Scott has an excellent mix of both regulated and unregulated business experience. While Scott has not previously had operational responsibilities in the midstream businesses, he shares my views of the importance of these businesses to the overall CenterPoint portfolio. Scott will be a great contributor, as we strive to grow our regulated and competitive businesses and enhance the value of CenterPoint to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary."

Greg will describe these acquisitions and their earnings potential in more detail in his comments.
In addition to the items I just mentioned, we have developed our earnings guidance range, based on performance to date, and by using a number of variables that may impact earnings such as commodity prices, throughput volume, weather, regulatory proceedings and effective tax rate. We have taken into account the benefit of debt reduction. However, we have not assumed additional earnings from the use of the remaining cash. Our revised guidance excludes a nonrecurring pretax gain of approximately $130 million. This gain will be recorded in the third quarter and is the result of remeasuring to fair value our regional 50% interest in the Waskom assets. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings outlook.
We continue to receive questions about the financing strategy of our midstream business, especially whether or not we have made a decision to form an MLP. We have $600 million to $700 million of available cash on hand, so there is no immediate need for financing. However, our confidence in our ability to make midstream investments over the long term continues to increase, and I expect this unit will ultimately need financing to support its expanding activities. Significant ongoing investments would make an MLP attractive. Of course, the capital and financing requirements of the company's other subsidiaries will play a role in this decision as well.
Also, I wanted to mention that last week we were very pleased to learn that Moody's upgraded the ratings outlook of both the parent company and Houston Electric from stable to positive. This is a reflection of the consistent improvement in our credit metrics and the overall strength of the company -- financial strength of the company. We look forward to building from our strong base of assets and continuing our track record of strong performance for our shareholders.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share dividend declared by the Board of Directors on July 25. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I'm pleased to report on 2 recent acquisitions that not only provide near-term earnings benefits, as Gary mentioned, but more importantly, position our field services and interstate pipeline businesses very well for the future.First, yo",748,"Thank you, Gary. I'm pleased to report on 2 recent acquisitions that not only provide near-term earnings benefits, as Gary mentioned, but more importantly, position our field services and interstate pipeline businesses very well for the future.
First, you may recall that in June, we signed an agreement with Martin Midstream to acquire their 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture asset, and several of the Prism Gas assets for approximately $275 million. This transaction closed on July 31, and we now own 100% of Waskom and are the operator of the facility. The purchase also includes Prism's Woodlawn gathering and processing system, and 3 smaller gathering systems: Mcleod, Hallsville and Darco. The Waskom assets include a recently expanded 320 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility, with 14,500 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. Along with the Harrison gathering system, a 75 million cubic feet per day gathering system connects to the Waskom plant.
Fleet Long [ph] is a 30 million cubic feet per day gathering and processing system located in Harrison County, Texas, with 3 smaller gathering systems combined to gather and treat more than 40 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, and are located near our other newly acquired assets in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana.
The majority of the throughput from the new gathering systems is connected to the Waskom plant with access to its extensive natural gas liquids markets in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent pipeline infrastructure. This acquisition, which positions us as the operator of key processing assets will provide a significant boost to our commercial efforts in the area. In particular, we have seen an increase in producer activity, due to the improved economics of producing liquids-rich natural gas in the Cotton Valley field, as well as other nearby formations, which is expected to enhance the inlet stream into the Waskom plant. Waskom provides a competitive market for natural gas liquids without the additional cost of transportation to the fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu. Waskom also provides several takeaway options for natural gas, including our CEGT pipeline and access to our Carthage to Perryville pipeline and our Perryville hub. Furthermore, the railroad loading facility, that was completed in late 2011, provides our customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids markets. In our new role as owner and operator of the Prism facilities in conjunction with our existing assets in the area, we expect to realize significant commercial and operational synergies.
Additionally, in May, we acquired Encana's Amoruso gathering and treating assets for approximately $89 million. Concurrently, we entered into a long-term gathering agreement for the Amoruso and Hilltop field production located in Robertson and Leon Counties in East Texas.
Encana has been an excellent partner for us since we entered our first agreement with them in the Haynesville Shale in September of 2009. The gathering agreement has a term of 15 years and includes an initial volume commitment, as well as a dedication of Encana's future production from the covered area. The contract also provides a guaranteed return on all future capital deployed to gather production within the dedicated acreage.
So, while drilling in dry gas areas like this one has slowed recently, the contracted volume commitments alone provide returns that meet our investment criteria. However, the ultimate recoverable reserves are significant in the dedicated area, and when drilling levels improve, we will been a great position to benefit from the increased production. As important, this transaction gives us a presence in the area and allows us to pursue liquids-rich and crude oil plays that producers are developing in that part of East Texas.
Now, let me address the transactions from a financial perspective. With the synergies we anticipate to capture through the Prism assets, the increase in liquids-rich volumes we expect at the Waskom plant and our producers current production profiles, we estimate that we paid approximately 7x 2013 EBITDA for the Amoruso and Prism assets combined. On an operating income basis, we expect Amoruso to contribute $9 million to $12 million per year over the next several years, and Prism to contribute $28 million to $33 million of operating income per year.
Finally, the Prism and Amoruso assets, in conjunction with the existing assets in our footprint, strategically positions us as a key gathering, processing and transportation service provider in the region, serving as a foundation for significant growth in the years ahead.
Now let me turn the call over to Carla."

First, a $252 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our competitive Energy Services business. And second, a $136 million noncash pretax gain associated with our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Waskom gathering and processing joint venture. Excluding these unusual items, net income for the third quarter of 2012 would have been $174 million or $0.40 per diluted share. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2011 was $973 million or $2.27 per diluted share. As you may recall, last year, we also recorded an unusual item, net income of $811 million associated with the power resolution of the true-up appeal. Excluding this unusual item, net income would have been $162 million or $0.38 per diluted share. 
Operating income for the third quarter was $88 million. Excluding unusual items, operating income for the third quarter would have been $340 million compared to $357 million for the same period last year. As you will hear in a few minutes from Scott, our businesses delivered solid performances this quarter, in line with our expectations. Our regulated electric and gas distribution utilities produced strong results and despite the low natural gas prices and the lack of basis differentials, our midstream and competitive Energy Services businesses performed well. 
I will now turn the call over to Gary."

The $252 mil",410,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would first like to discuss the 2 unusual items that are included in our results this third quarter, then I will review our debt refinancing, earnings guidance and dividend declaration. The $252 million noncash impairment charge relates to the goodwill resulting from the 1997 merger between Houston Industries and Bahram Energy. $335 million of that goodwill was associated with our competitive Energy Services business. 
In the third quarter of each year, we perform a goodwill impairment test. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our Energy Services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this business. No other business unit required a goodwill impairment charge. 
We also recorded a $136 million noncash gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture. This acquisition is classified as the business combination achieved in stages, required a writeup of our additional 50% interest to fair value. 
Turning to our financing activities during the quarter. We took advantage of very low interest rates and refinanced some of our debts. Specifically, Houston Electric issued $800 million of general mortgage bonds at attractive rates and redeemed $800 million of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds scheduled to mature in 2014. The redemption premium on the 2 series was approximately $69 million, and this refinancing will reduce our annual interest payments by approximately $28 million. 
Now let me discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our press release, we reaffirmed our second quarter estimate for annual earnings in the range of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. Our guidance excludes the effects of the goodwill impairment charge in the Waskom acquisition gain. As a reminder, our earnings guidance range is based on our performance to date and includes a number of variables such as commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceeding and our effective tax rate. 
I'd also like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share regular dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 24. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Now let me turn the call over to Scott, who will discuss the quarterly results of our businesses in more detail."

I'll begin with Houston Electric with reported operating income of $205 million this quarter or $8 million less than the third quarter of 2011, which included the benefits of extremely hot and dry summer weat",1016,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin with Houston Electric with reported operating income of $205 million this quarter or $8 million less than the third quarter of 2011, which included the benefits of extremely hot and dry summer weather. This year's operating income benefited from the growth of more than 40,000 customers since the third quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which we believe should continue for the remainder of the year. 
We also benefited from higher transmission-related revenue, the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's true-up proceeds and an increase in miscellaneous revenues. More than offsetting these benefits, however, were $38 million impact from the return to more normal weather and the $9 million impact from the rate changes implemented in September of 2011. Overall, Houston Electric had a strong quarter and is expected to have another good year. To address the growing infrastructure needs of the Houston service territory, we expect invest capital in excess of $500 million per year for the next several years resulting in rate base growth of approximately 4% per year. Given our transmission and distribution capital recovery mechanisms, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case in the near term. 
Our natural gas distribution business reported $5 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2012, which was $7 million more than last year. This quarter benefited from the growth of more than 31,000 customers since the third quarter of last year. Additionally, we have been focused on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of an extremely mild winter. We have seen the benefit of these efforts and expect to see similar benefits for the remainder of the year. 
Annual rate adjustment mechanisms in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage without the need for expensive and time-consuming rate proceedings. We are also benefiting from increased customer charges in our Texas jurisdictions. 
We continue to focus on system reliability by replacing older infrastructure and on upgrading our systems to enhance customer service. These investments, together with normal load growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million annually and produce rate base growth of approximately 6% per year. 
Now let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $48 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of reductions in seasonal and market-sensitive transportation and ancillary services and the reduction in compressor efficiency on our Carthage to Perryville pipeline due to lower volumes. Low natural gas prices and significantly compressed basis continue to adversely impact this business. 
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $8 million compared to $6 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract with an anchor shipper that started in January of this year. From a commercial perspective, we continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipeline with particular focus on power generation and natural gas producers. 
In addition, we continue to evaluate the current rates and rate structures for our 2 interstate pipelines. In August, Mississippi river transmission filed its first rate case since 2001 and requested a $47 million rate increase. Our filing is based on an updated cost of service including new depreciation rates, a capital structure composed of 61% equity and a 13.6% return on equity. We also stopped a recovery compliance cost surcharge to recover future security, safety and environmental costs associated with mandated requirements. 
In September, the court issued an order accepting MRT's filing, suspending the filed tariff rates until March of 2013 and limiting the scope of the surcharge to the recovery of security costs. MRT has asked for a rehearing on the surcharge issues. Unless we reach a settlement on the rate case, we expect the third quarter 2013 hearing. 
In October, we also initiated discussions with customers for a new tariff structure on our CEGT pipeline. These discussions centered around an updated cost of service and the mechanism for recovering increased costs associated with security, safety and environmental activities similar to the mechanism we requested in our MRT rate filing. 
Turning now to our Field Services unit. We report an operating income of $55 million compared to $61 million for the same quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited by $7 million from the Amoruso and Prism acquisitions. These benefits were offset by lower revenues from sales of retained natural gas due to lower prices, reduced throughput from our traditional basins and the timing of revenue recognition related to throughput commitments. These throughput commitments are an important feature of our contracts, and Greg will discuss them in greater detail in later in the call. 
With respect to our gathering volumes, throughput increased approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect our overall system throughput to average around 2.4 billion cubic feet per day through year-end, including approximately 200 million cubic feet per day from our recent acquisitions. 
Our competitive Energy Services business reported an operating a loss of $7 million, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed -- impairment charge discussed by Gary, as compared to an operating loss of $10 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting and gas inventory write-downs, results for the third quarter of 2012 increased $11 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. This business is benefiting from the elimination of uneconomic fixed cost transportation and storage agreements and the growth in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to be on expanding our customer base, rationalizing our fixed costs and growing our product and service offerings. 
In summary, our business units delivered solid, operating and financial results. And the benefits of our balanced, electric and gas portfolio were again evident this quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

Field Services provides gathering, treat",709,"Thank you, Scott. I want to take this opportunity provide some additional information of our field service business. Specifically, we continue to get questions on our throughput commitments and recent acquisitions. Field Services provides gathering, treating, processing and other related services to producers in and around the traditional natural gas production basins of Artoma, Anadarko and architects, as well as in the unconventional shale plays of Fayetteville, Haynesville and. We operate 4,000 miles of gathering pipelines, processing plants with a capacity of 625 million cubic feet per day and treating plants with a capacity of approximately 9,000 gallons per minute. 
Today, about 40% of our volumes come from traditional gathering basins while 60% are from the shale plays. These percentages are inclusive of the recent acquisitions, which we consider in the traditional category. 
Marshal and operating initiatives evolved with market dynamics and customer requests. We strive to revive best-in-market services, especially when it comes to being on time and on budget. Our track record, combined with our focus on building strong relationships, serves us well as projects emerge. Generally, our Field Services business seeks unlevered after-tax returns on investment in the low- to mid-teens. While other gatherers may seek higher returns, our contracting strategies mitigate project risk with longer terms of 10 to 15 years and throughput commitments or guaranteed returns especially on large capital projects. Of course, without these mitigants, we would require higher returns. However, we find that our customers value priced strength and market access certainty provided by our contracting strategies. In turn, we benefit from more stable revenues and cash flows. Without these throughput commitment strategies, we will be recognizing this revenue at this year. 
Now let me discuss how throughput commitments can affect the timing of revenue recognition. Throughout the year, producer production reports and actual volumes are closely monitored to ensure that revenue is recognized in accordance with contract terms and throughput commitments. First, contract years are usually not the same as calendar years. Second, we recognize revenue based on both actual and projected flows. If a producer report indicates that production will not meet the throughput commitment in a particular contract year, we calculate the amount of revenue associated with the actual production and the amount of payable under the throughput commitment for the applicable calendar quarter. 
Shortfall throughput volumes and retained gas are not included in throughput data, which we provide as part of our supplemental financial materials. As a rule of thumb, we have previously stated a good rule of thumb is that retained gas is equal to about 1.5% of throughput. However, we have and can realize levels at or above 2% based on concerted optimization efforts. 
Following our recent acquisitions, we now own 100% of the Waskom gas processing plant in East Texas. This facility is capable of processing approximately 320 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. It also include a 14,500-barrel per day fractionation plant in an ethane line, which directly serves a major market. Waskom provides several takeaway options for natural gas including our CEGT pipeline and our Carthage to Perryville pipeline. 
Furthermore, the rail loading facility that was completed in the late 2011 provides customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids markets. We are 2 months into our integration of all the Prism assets and are beginning to implement changes to optimize certain operations at these facilities. 
From a risk standpoint, we mitigate commodity exposures through our contracting methods. On the liquid side, our commodity contract account for about 35% of all of our processing revenue. However, we have the option to change the majority of these contracts to fix these structures if we so choose. 
Finally, we are pursuing a number of potential built services projects in the Bakken, Mississippi Lime, Marine and other place and/or near our footprint. Clearly, we would like to be in a position to discuss these more completely. However, we're still in a discussion, evaluation or negotiation phase and are not able to give more details at this time. We can say that the Bakken survey and service assessment has been completed and we are finalizing our estimates for the capital requirements for this project. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to David"

Probably well activity this year is about half or maybe even a little less than half of what we saw last year. But we also know there is a heck of a lot of gas in these basins and they will ultimately be produced. So as gas prices move up, I think we're going to see activity, which is going to drive just gathering volumes and expansions of this system. But just -- not just as importantly, but there is another aspect and that's our retained gas phase. As Greg said the we retained about 1.5% and 2% if we can really optimize compression. That provides upside as natural gas prices rise as well. And so I think we'll see it on a natural gas sales retained gas, as well as just throughput and our system. That's going to be a little further down the road because we know that gas prices aren't expected, at least in our forecast to jump above $4 per year or 2."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. This morning, I will discuss our consolidated results for the third quarter of 2012. Gary will discuss 2 unusual amount cash items recorded this quarter, as well as some recent financing activities. Scott will comment on the performance of each business unit. And finally, Greg will discuss certain aspects of our Field Services business. 
This morning, we reported net income of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The results for the third quarter of 2012 include 2 unusual items. First, a $252 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our competitive Energy Services business. And second, a $136 million noncash pretax gain associated with our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Waskom gathering and processing joint venture. Excluding these unusual items, net income for the third quarter of 2012 would have been $174 million or $0.40 per diluted share. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2011 was $973 million or $2.27 per diluted share. As you may recall, last year, we also recorded an unusual item. Net income of $811 million associated with the final  resolution of the true-up appeal. Excluding this unusual item, net income would have been $162 million or $0.38 per diluted share. 
Operating income for the third quarter was $88 million. Excluding unusual items, operating income for the third quarter would have been $340 million compared to $357 million for the same period last year. 
As you will hear in a few minutes from Scott, our businesses delivered solid performances this quarter, in line with our expectations. Our regulated electric and gas distribution utilities produced strong results and despite the low natural gas prices and the lack of basis differentials, our midstream and competitive Energy Services businesses performed well. 
I will now turn the call over to Gary."

Then, I will review our debt refinancing, earnings guidance and dividend declaration. 
The $252 million noncash impairment charge relates to the goodwill resulting from the 1997 merger between Houston Industries and NorAm Energy.  $335 million of that goodwill was associated with our competitive Energy Services business. 
In the third quarter of each year, we perform a goodwill impairment test. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our Energy Services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials, led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this business. No other business unit required a goodwill impairment charge. 
We also recorded a $136 million noncash gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture. This acquisition is classified as a business combination achieved in stages requiring a writeup of our additional 50% interest to fair value. 
Turning to our financing activities during the quarter. We took advantage of very low interest rates and refinanced some of our debts. Specifically, Houston Electric issued $800 million of general mortgage bonds at attractive rates and redeemed $800 million of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds scheduled to mature in 2014. The redemption premium on the 2 series was approximately $69 million, and this refinancing will reduce our annual interest payments by approximately $28 million. 
Now, let me discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our press release, we reaffirmed our second quarter estimate for annual earnings in the range of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. Our guidance excludes the effects of the goodwill impairment charge in the Waskom acquisition gain. As a reminder, our earnings guidance range is based on our performance to date and includes a number of variables such as commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceeding and our effective tax rate. 
I'd also like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share regular dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 24. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Now, let me turn the call over to Scott, who will discuss the quarterly results of our businesses in more detail."
279513,217880279,380665,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2012",2012-11-07,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin with Houston Electric which reported operating income of $205 million this quarter or $8 million less than the third quarter of 2011 which included the benefits of extremely hot and dry summer weat",1018,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin with Houston Electric which reported operating income of $205 million this quarter or $8 million less than the third quarter of 2011 which included the benefits of extremely hot and dry summer weather. This year's operating income benefited from the growth of more than 40,000 customers since the third quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which's we believe should continue for the remainder of the year. 
We also benefited from higher transmission-related revenue, the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's true-up proceeds and an increase in miscellaneous revenues. More than offsetting these benefits, however, were a $38 million impact from the return to more normal weather and a $9 million impact from the rate changes implemented in September of 2011. Overall, Houston Electric had a strong quarter and is expected to have another good year. 
To address the growing infrastructure needs of the Houston service territory, we expect to invest capital in excess of $500 million per year for the next several years resulting in rate base growth of approximately 4% per year. Given our transmission and distribution capital recovery mechanisms, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case in the near term. 
Our natural gas distribution business reported $5 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2012, which was $7 million more than last year. This quarter benefited from the growth of more than 31,000 customers since the third quarter of last year. Additionally, we have been focused on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of an extremely mild winter. We have seen the benefit of these efforts and expect to see similar benefits for the remainder of the year. 
Annual rate adjustment mechanisms in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage without the need for expensive and time-consuming rate proceedings. We are also benefiting from the increased customer charges in our Texas jurisdictions. 
We continue to focus on system reliability by replacing older infrastructure and on upgrading our systems to enhance customer service. These investments, together with normal load growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million annually and produce rate base growth of approximately 6% per year. 
Now, let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $48 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of reductions in seasonal and market-sensitive transportation and ancillary services and a reduction in compressor efficiency on our Carthage to Perryville pipeline due to lower volumes. Low natural gas prices and significantly compressed basis continue to adversely impact this business. 
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $8 million compared to $6 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract with an anchor shipper that started in January of this year. From a commercial perspective, we continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines with particular focus on power generation and natural gas producers. 
In addition, we continue to evaluate the current rates and rate structures for our 2 interstate pipelines. In August, Mississippi River Transmission filed its first rate case since 2001 and requested a $47 million rate increase. Our filing is based on an updated cost of service including new depreciation rates, a capital structure composed of 61% equity and a 13.6% return on equity. We also sought a recovery compliance cost surcharge to recover future security, safety and environmental costs associated with the mandated requirements. 
In September, the court issued an order accepting MRT's filing, suspending the filed tariff rates until March of 2013 and limiting the scope of the surcharge to the recovery of security costs. MRT has asked for a rehearing on the surcharge issues. Unless we reach a settlement on the rate case, we expect the third quarter 2013 hearing. 
In October, we also initiated discussions with customers for a new tariff structure on our CEGT pipeline. These discussions centered around an updated cost of service and the mechanism for recovering increased costs associated with security, safety and environmental activities similar to the mechanism we requested in our MRT rate filing. 
Turning now to our Field Services unit. We reported operating income of $55 million compared to $61 million for the same quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited by $7 million from the Amoruso and Prism acquisitions. These benefits were offset by lower revenues from sales of retained natural gas due to lower prices, reduced throughput from our traditional basins and the timing of revenue recognition related to throughput commitments. These throughput commitments are an important feature of our contracts, and Greg will discuss them in greater detail later in the call. 
With respect to our gathering volumes, throughput increased approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect our overall system throughput to average around 2.4 billion cubic feet per day through year-end, including approximately 200 million cubic feet per day from our recent acquisitions. 
Our competitive Energy Services business reported an operating a loss of $7 million, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed -- impairment charge discussed by Gary, as compared to an operating loss of $10 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting and gas inventory write-downs, results for the third quarter of 2012 increased $11 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. This business is benefiting from the elimination of uneconomic fixed cost transportation and storage agreements and the growth in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to be on expanding our customer base, rationalizing our fixed costs and growing our product and service offerings. 
In summary, our business units delivered solid, operating and financial results. And the benefits of our balanced electric and gas portfolio were again evident this quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."
279513,217880279,380665,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2012",2012-11-07,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

Field Services provides gathering, tr",709,"Thank you, Scott. I want to take this opportunity provide some additional information about our Field Service business. Specifically, we continue to get questions on our throughput commitments and recent acquisitions. Field Services provides gathering, treating, processing and other related services to producers in and around their traditional natural gas production basins of Arkoma, Anadarko and ArkLaTex, as well as in the unconventional shale plays of Fayetteville, Haynesville and Woodford. We operate 4,000 miles of gathering pipelines, processing plants with a capacity of 625 million cubic feet per day and treating plants with a capacity of approximately 9,000 gallons per minute. 
Today, about 40% of our volumes come from traditional gathering basins, while 60% are from shale plays. These percentages are inclusive of the recent acquisitions which we consider in the traditional category. 
Commercial and operating initiatives evolve with market dynamics and customer requests. We strive to revive best-in-market services, especially when it comes to being on time and on budget. Our track record, combined with our focus on building strong relationships, serves us well as projects emerge. Generally, our Field Services business seeks unlevered after-tax returns on investment in the low- to mid-teens. While other gatherers may seek higher returns, our contracting strategies mitigate project risk with longer terms of 10 to 15 years and throughput commitments or guaranteed returns, especially on large capital projects. Of course, without these mitigants, we would require higher returns. However, we find that our customers value price assurance and market access certainty provided by our contracting strategies. In turn, we benefit from more stable revenues and cash flows. Without this throughput commitment strategy, we would be recognizing less revenue this year. 
Now, let me discuss how throughput commitments can affect the timing of revenue recognition. Throughout the year, producer production reports and actual volumes are closely monitored to ensure that revenue is recognized in accordance with contract terms and throughput commitments. First, contract years are usually not the same as calendar years. Second, we recognize revenue based on both actual and projected flows. If a producer report indicates that production will not meet the throughput commitment in a particular contract year, we calculate the amount of revenue associated with the actual production and the amount of payable under the throughput commitment for the applicable calendar quarter. 
Shortfall throughput volumes and retained gas are not included in throughput data, which we provide as part of our supplemental financial materials. As a rule of thumb, we have previously stated a good rule of thumb is that retained gas is equal to about 1.5% of throughput. However, we have and can realize levels at or above 2% based on concerted optimization efforts. 
Following our recent acquisitions, we now own 100% of the Waskom gas processing plant in East Texas. This facility is capable of processing approximately 320 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. It also includes a 14,500-barrel per day fractionation plant in an ethane line which directly serves a major market. Waskom provides several takeaway options for natural gas including our CEGT pipelines and our Carthage to Perryville pipeline. 
Furthermore, the rail loading facility that was completed in the late 2011 provides customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids markets. We are 2 months into our integration of all the Prism assets and are beginning to implement changes to optimize certain operations at these facilities. 
From a risk standpoint, we mitigate commodity exposure through our contracting methods. On the liquid side, our commodity-sensitive contracts account for about 35% of all of our processing revenue. However, we have the option to change the majority of these contracts to fix these structures if we so choose. 
Finally, we are pursuing a number of potential Field Services projects in the Bakken, Mississippi Lime, Tuscaloosa Marine and other place in or near our footprint. Clearly, we would like to be in a position to discuss these more completely. However, we're still in the discussion, evaluation and/or negotiation phase, and are not able to give more details at this time. We can say that the Bakken survey and right-of-way assessment have been completed and we're finalizing our estimates of the capital requirements for this project. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to David."

We serve traditional basis -- basins, as well as some dry gas basins. At this low gas price, we're not seeing a lot of well activity. Probably, well activity this year is about half or maybe even a little less than half of what we saw last year. But we also know there is a heck of a lot of gas in these basins and it will ultimately be produced. So as gas prices move up, I think we're going to see activity, which is going to drive just gathering volumes and expansions of this system. But just -- not just as importantly, but there is another aspect, and that's our retained gas piece. As Greg said, we retained about 1.5% and 2% if we can really optimize compression. That provides upside as natural gas prices rise as well. And so, I think we'll see it on a natural gas sales retained gas, as well as just throughput, in our system. That's going to be a little further down the road because we know that gas prices aren't expected, at least in our forecast, to jump above $4 for a year or two."

Gary will discuss 2 unusual amount cash items recorded this quarter, as well as some recent financing activities. Scott will comment on the performance of each business unit. And finally, Greg will discuss certain aspects of our Field Services business. 
This morning, we reported net income of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The results for the third quarter of 2012 include 2 unusual items. First, a $252 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our competitive Energy Services business. And second, a $136 million noncash pretax gain associated with our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Waskom gathering and processing joint venture. Excluding these unusual items, net income for the third quarter of 2012 would have been $174 million or $0.40 per diluted share. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2011 was $973 million or $2.27 per diluted share. As you may recall, last year, we also recorded an unusual item. Net income of $811 million associated with the final  resolution of the true-up appeal. Excluding this unusual item, net income would have been $162 million or $0.38 per diluted share. 
Operating income for the third quarter was $88 million. Excluding unusual items, operating income for the third quarter would have been $340 million compared to $357 million for the same period last year. 
As you will hear in a few minutes from Scott, our businesses delivered solid performances this quarter, in line with our expectations. Our regulated electric and gas distribution utilities produced strong results and despite the low natural gas prices and the lack of basis differentials, our midstream and competitive Energy Services businesses performed well.

The $252 million noncash impairment charge relates to the goodwill resulting from the 1997 merger between Houston Industries and NorAm Energy.  $335 million of that goodwill was associated with our competitive Energy Services business. 
In the third quarter of each year, we perform a goodwill impairment test. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our Energy Services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials, led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this business. No other business unit required a goodwill impairment charge. 
We also recorded a $136 million noncash gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Waskom joint venture. This acquisition is classified as a business combination achieved in stages requiring a writeup of our original 50% interest to fair value. 
Turning to our financing activities during the quarter. We took advantage of very low interest rates and refinanced some of our debt. Specifically, Houston Electric issued $800 million of general mortgage bonds at attractive rates and redeemed $800 million of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds scheduled to mature in 2014. The redemption premium on the 2 series was approximately $69 million, and this refinancing will reduce our annual interest payments by approximately $28 million. 
Now, let me discuss our 2012 earnings guidance. This morning in our press release, we reaffirmed our second quarter estimate for annual earnings in the range of $1.13 to $1.23 per diluted share. Our guidance excludes the effects of the goodwill impairment charge and the Waskom acquisition gain. As a reminder, our earnings guidance range is based on our performance to date and includes a number of variables such as commodity prices, volume throughput, weather, regulatory proceeding and our effective tax rate. 
I'd also like to remind you of the $0.2025 per share regular dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 24. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. 
Now, let me turn the call over to Scott, who will discuss the quarterly results of our businesses in more detail."

I'll begin with Houston Electric which reported operating income of $205 million this quarter or $8 million less than the third quarter of 2011 which included the benefits of extremely hot and dry summer weat",1015,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin with Houston Electric which reported operating income of $205 million this quarter or $8 million less than the third quarter of 2011 which included the benefits of extremely hot and dry summer weather. This year's operating income benefited from the growth of more than 40,000 customers since the third quarter of last year. This represents a growth rate of 2%, which we believe should continue for the remainder of the year. 
We also benefited from higher transmission-related revenue, the ongoing recognition of deferred equity returns associated with the company's true-up proceeds and an increase in miscellaneous revenues. More than offsetting these benefits, however, were a $38 million impact from the return to more normal weather and a $9 million impact from the rate changes implemented in September of 2011. Overall, Houston Electric had a strong quarter and is expected to have another good year. 
To address the growing infrastructure needs of the Houston service territory, we expect to invest capital in excess of $500 million per year for the next several years resulting in rate base growth of approximately 4% per year. Given our transmission and distribution capital recovery mechanisms, we don't anticipate the need for a major Houston Electric rate case in the near term. 
Our natural gas distribution business reported $5 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2012, which was $7 million more than last year. This quarter benefited from the growth of more than 31,000 customers since the third quarter of last year. Additionally, we have been focused on productivity gains and operating efficiencies to offset the impact of an extremely mild winter. We have seen the benefit of these efforts and expect to see similar benefits for the remainder of the year. 
Annual rate adjustment mechanisms in a number of our jurisdictions continue to help us recover new investments, as well as to offset reductions in usage without the need for expensive and time-consuming rate proceedings. We are also benefiting from increased customer charges in our Texas jurisdictions. 
We continue to focus on system reliability by replacing older infrastructure and on upgrading our systems to enhance customer service. These investments, together with normal load growth and system maintenance, are expected to require capital expenditures of $350 million to $400 million annually and produce rate base growth of approximately 6% per year. 
Now, let me turn to our midstream businesses. Our interstate pipelines unit recorded operating income of $48 million compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011. The decline was primarily the result of reductions in seasonal and market-sensitive transportation and ancillary services and a reduction in compressor efficiency on our Carthage to Perryville pipeline due to lower volumes. Low natural gas prices and significantly compressed basis continue to adversely impact this business. 
Equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $8 million compared to $6 million in the same quarter of 2011, reflecting the benefit of a new contract with an anchor shipper that started in January of this year. From a commercial perspective, we continue to pursue opportunities to serve customers on or near our pipelines with particular focus on power generation and natural gas producers. 
In addition, we continue to evaluate the current rates and rate structures for our 2 interstate pipelines. In August, Mississippi River Transmission filed its first rate case since 2001 and requested a $47 million rate increase. Our filing is based on an updated cost of service including new depreciation rates, a capital structure composed of 61% equity and a 13.6% return on equity. We also sought a recovery compliance cost surcharge to recover future security, safety and environmental costs associated with mandated requirements. 
In September, the FERC issued an order accepting MRT's filing, suspending the filed tariff rates until March of 2013 and limiting the scope of the surcharge to the recovery of security costs. MRT has asked for a rehearing on the surcharge issues. Unless we reach a settlement on the rate case, we expect the third quarter 2013 hearing. 
In October, we also initiated discussions with customers for a new tariff structure on our CEGT pipeline. These discussions centered around an updated cost of service and the mechanism for recovering increased costs associated with security, safety and environmental activities similar to the mechanism we requested in our MRT rate filing. 
Turning now to our Field Services unit. We reported operating income of $55 million compared to $61 million for the same quarter of 2011. Operating income benefited by $7 million from the Amoruso and Prism acquisitions. These benefits were offset by lower revenues from sales of retained natural gas due to lower prices, reduced throughput from our traditional basins and the timing of revenue recognition related to throughput commitments. These throughput commitments are an important feature of our contracts, and Greg will discuss them in greater detail later in the call. 
With respect to our gathering volumes, throughput increased approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect our overall system throughput to average around 2.4 billion cubic feet per day through year-end, including approximately 200 million cubic feet per day from our recent acquisitions. 
Our competitive Energy Services business reported an operating loss of $7 million, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed -- impairment charge discussed by Gary, as compared to an operating loss of $10 million in the same quarter of last year. After adjusting for mark-to-market accounting and gas inventory write-downs, results for the third quarter of 2012 increased $11 million compared to the third quarter of 2011. This business is benefiting from the elimination of uneconomic fixed cost transportation and storage agreements and the growth in both retail customers and sales volumes. Our focus continues to be on expanding our customer base, rationalizing our fixed costs and growing our product and service offerings. 
In summary, our business units delivered solid, operating and financial results. And the benefits of our balanced electric and gas portfolio were again evident this quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

I want to take this opportunity to provide some additional information about our Field Service business. Specifically, we continue to get questions on our throughput commitments and recent acquisitions. Field Services provides gathering,",710,"Thank you, Scott. I want to take this opportunity to provide some additional information about our Field Service business. Specifically, we continue to get questions on our throughput commitments and recent acquisitions. Field Services provides gathering, treating, processing and other related services to producers in and around their traditional natural gas production basins of Arkoma, Anadarko and ArkLaTex, as well as in the unconventional shale plays of Fayetteville, Haynesville and Woodford. We operate 4,000 miles of gathering pipelines, processing plants with a capacity of 625 million cubic feet per day and treating plants with a capacity of approximately 9,000 gallons per minute. 
Today, about 40% of our volumes come from traditional gathering basins, while 60% are from the shale plays. These percentages are inclusive of the recent acquisitions which we consider in the traditional category. 
Commercial and operating initiatives evolve with market dynamics and customer requests. We strive to revive best-in-market services, especially when it comes to being on time and on budget. Our track record, combined with our focus on building strong relationships, serves us well as projects emerge. Generally, our Field Services business seeks unlevered after-tax returns on investment in the low- to mid-teens. While other gatherers may seek higher returns, our contracting strategies mitigate project risk with longer terms of 10 to 15 years and throughput commitments or guaranteed returns, especially on large capital projects. Of course, without these mitigants, we would require higher returns. However, we find that our customers value price assurance and market access certainty provided by our contracting strategies. In turn, we benefit from more stable revenues and cash flows. Without this throughput commitment strategy, we would be recognizing less revenue this year. 
Now, let me discuss how throughput commitments can affect the timing of revenue recognition. Throughout the year, producer production reports and actual volumes are closely monitored to ensure that revenue is recognized in accordance with contract terms and throughput commitments. First, contract years are usually not the same as calendar years. Second, we recognize revenue based on both actual and projected flows. If a producer report indicates that production will not meet the throughput commitment in a particular contract year, we calculate the amount of revenue associated with the actual production and the amount of payable under the throughput commitment for the applicable calendar quarter. 
Shortfall throughput volumes and retained gas are not included in throughput data, which we provide as part of our supplemental financial materials. As a rule of thumb, we have previously stated a good rule of thumb is that retained gas is equal to about 1.5% of throughput. However, we have and can realize levels at or above 2% based on concerted optimization efforts. 
Following our recent acquisitions, we now own 100% of the Waskom gas processing plant in East Texas. This facility is capable of processing approximately 320 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. It also includes a 14,500-barrel per day fractionation plant in an ethane line which directly serves a major market. Waskom provides several takeaway options for natural gas including our CEGT pipeline and our Carthage to Perryville pipeline. 
Furthermore, the rail loading facility that was completed in late 2011 provides customers optionality and increased access to premium natural gas liquids markets. We are 2 months into our integration of all the Prism assets and are beginning to implement changes to optimize certain operations at these facilities. 
From a risk standpoint, we mitigate commodity exposure through our contracting methods. On the liquid side, our commodity-sensitive contracts account for about 35% of all of our processing revenue. However, we have the option to change the majority of these contracts to fix these structures if we so choose. 
Finally, we are pursuing a number of potential Field Services projects in the Bakken, Mississippi Lime, Tuscaloosa Marine and other place in or near our footprint. Clearly, we would like to be in a position to discuss these more completely. However, we're still in the discussion, evaluation and/or negotiation phase, and are not able to give more details at this time. We can say that the Bakken survey and right-of-way assessment have been completed and we're finalizing our estimates of the capital requirements for this project. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to David."

We serve traditional basis -- basins, as well as dry gas basins. At this low gas price, we're not seeing a lot of well activity. Probably, well activity this year is about half or maybe even a little less than half of what we saw last year. But we also know there is a heck of a lot of gas in these basins and it will ultimately be produced. So as gas prices move up, I think we're going to see activity, which is going to drive just gathering volumes and expansions of this system. But just -- not just as importantly, but there is another aspect, and that's our retained gas piece. As Greg said, we retain about 1.5% and 2% if we can really optimize compression. That provides upside as natural gas prices rise as well. And so, I think we'll see it on the natural gas sales retained gas, as well as just throughput, in our system. That's going to be a little further down the road because we know that gas prices aren't expected, at least in our forecast, to jump above $4 for a year or two."
