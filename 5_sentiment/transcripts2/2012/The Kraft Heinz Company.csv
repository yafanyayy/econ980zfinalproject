Overall, we're very plea",1296,"Thanks, Meg, and good morning, everyone. Today, Ed and I will take you to through our Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY. Overall, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter, highlighted by strong top line growth and good P&L leverage. The key facets of the performance for Q3 include strong sales growth, again driven by Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands, continuing investments in marketing, processes and systems that drive future growth and productivity and a double-digit increase in EPS, reflecting solid growth in operating income and a better-than-expected tax rate. In short, we drove both top and bottom line growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Turning to our items P&L scorecard for the quarter, you can see the currency translation had a negligible effect. Overall, sales grew by more than 7%. Operating income increased better than 4% and EPS was up 13%. That's a good result as we continue to increase the investment in our brands and on Project Keystone while tightly controlling other spending. EPS got a boost from the favorable tax rate which was 20% for the quarter. Again, this was better than expected and added $0.07 to the year-on-year increase in EPS. The most difficult result for the quarter was gross margin. While this margin level represents a continuation of sequential improvement in the business and is our high watermark so far this fiscal year, it was still 140 basis points below last year. Now to put this into perspective, our gross margin performance for the quarter was the third best in the peer group. We've left off specific company names here, but you can see that the whole group is working to overcome the harsh commodity inflation buckling the industry. 
We're obviously not satisfied with this and our expectations are that commodity inflation, while not going away, will continue to moderate, easing the pressure on gross margins somewhat. With that said, let's turn back to the top line story. We're very proud of the fact that we've now driven 27 consecutive quarters of organic growth. And this quarter's organic growth of 4.6% represents our highest growth rate in nearly 3 years. Importantly, all segments reported positive organic sales growth in the quarter, led by the Rest of World and Asia/Pacific segments, but also reflecting positive growth in difficult developed markets of Europe and North America. Again, this quarter, the formula for growth is based on our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands. 
On our last earnings call, we mentioned that growth in Emerging Markets would accelerate in Q3, and that's exactly what happened. For the quarter, Emerging Markets generated very strong organic growth of 20%, and on a reported basis, the number was even stronger, up about 40% when you include sales from the Quero business we bought in Brazil in Q4 last year. Now on an organic basis, growth was driven by Latin America, China, Russia, Indonesia, India and Africa/Middle East. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Global Ketchup as well, where we delivered 9% organic growth, led by Latin America, U.S. Foodservice and Russia. Though smaller scale, we also posted big percentage gains on Heinz Ketchup in Brazil and in China. And to round out the discussion of our growth engines, the Top 15 brands posted 6% organic growth, led by the Heinz bread, the Master brand of soy sauces in China and our ABC brand in Indonesia. Our Top 15 brands represent more than 70% of global sales and continue to grow as a percentage of our total mix. 
A key to the continued growth in our portfolio is increasing support of our brands. Over a 5-year period ending in fiscal 2011, Heinz increased marketing spending by almost 60% to help drive organic growth and we're continuing to increase our investment level this fiscal year. Through the first 9 months of FY '12, our spending is up another 10%, reflecting higher spending in both emerging and developed markets. 
Now let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted stable results in a difficult market with a challenged consumer. Organic sales were up 1%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of Boston Market. Organic sales of frozen products were up in the U.S., while Ore-Ida sales were basically flat. The gains in frozen were partially offset by weaker sales in pasta sauces. Gross margin was impacted by net commodity inflation and lower margin product mix. We effectively leveraged SG&A spending and we're excited to see the new accessible price point products reaching store shelves in Q4. We'll talk more about that next week at CAGNY. 
U.S. Foodservice business returned to sales and profit growth in Q3, driven by branded front of house products and continuing productivity initiatives. Importantly, Dip & Squeeze distribution continues to expand and is now available at Wendy's. With this addition, Dip & Squeeze already represents about 25% of our total branded portion control Ketchup business in the United States. The industry saw modest improvement in overall restaurant traffic, particularly in December, driven largely by quick serve restaurants, though traffic in some of our key customers IS still down slightly. Gross margins strengthened sequentially but still below prior year as net pricing has increased and commodity inflation is beginning to moderate. And finally, we continue to rationalize the factory footprint in order to drive down fixed costs. 
Despite the headlights coming out of Europe these days, Heinz posted solid results with constant currency sales up almost 4% and operating income about flat. Organic growth for the region was driven by another strong quarter in the U.K., up 6% and continuing momentum in Russia, up 19%. Italy, on the other hand, was impacted by the country's debt crisis and incurred a 3-day national truck strike at the end of our quarterly January. We continue to invest in processes and systems across Europe and are very pleased with ongoing progress in the rollout of Project Keystone and the establishment of the European supply chain hub and new Innovation Center. 
Turning to the Asia/Pacific, that region posted nearly 7% constant currency sales growth and almost 23% operating income growth, a dramatic improvement from their results last quarter. Each emerging market in the region drove double-digit sales growth, led by China, Indonesia and India. China is generating particularly good growth in Foodstar, western sauces and Infant/Nutrition. Operating income improvement for the segment was led by excellent growth in China, Japan and Indonesia. We also saw a sequential improvement in Australia this quarter, driven by new leadership there. 
Turning to the rest of the world segment, on a constant currency basis, both sales and operating income more than doubled. This growth was driven by continued strong performance in Latin America. A key element here is the addition of the Quero brand in Brazil where the quarter sales in Brazil exceeded $100 million. Notably, we began distributing Heinz ketchup in Brazil through the Quero sales force and we've seen ketchup sales almost doubled. Though still small, we had high expectations for this Ketchup business. 
Adding to the growth story Latin America, we recently launched new baby food and ketchup pouches in Mexico and Central America. They're off to a great start and we think this will be an important packaging innovation for cash-strapped consumers. 
And finally, Africa/Middle East contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter as well. Now I'd like to turn it over to Ed for a bit deeper insight on the quarter. Ed?"

I'll take you through some of the details underlying our financial results which reflect strong top line and bottom line growth. Let's look first at EPS. Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're reporting",1180,"Thanks, Art. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some of the details underlying our financial results which reflect strong top line and bottom line growth. Let's look first at EPS. Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're reporting our results for fiscal 2012 adjusting for the special charges related to our productivity initiatives. 
To summarize Q3, going from right to left, including the $0.07 cost of our productivity initiatives, reported EPS was $0.88, up $0.04 or almost 5% from last year. Our constant currency EPS and EPS excluding special charges were both $0.95, up 13.1% as foreign exchange activity this quarter had virtually no impact on the bottom line. Here, you can see the components of our productivity charges and where there are reflected in the P&L. In Q3, we incurred $9 million for severance and employee benefit costs related to the reduction of the global workforce. $11 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of 6 factories so far this year and we're working towards exiting at least 2 more factories by year end. $14 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees, contract termination and relocation costs, incurred to improve manufacturing efficiencies most notably affecting our Australian business. Overall, we recorded charges of $34 million pretax, of which $22 million is in cost of goods sold and $12 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of the charges was $23 million or $0.07 per share and the entire amount was reported in our non-operating segment. 
As a reminder, we currently expect the total cost of these initiatives to be around $215 million pretax or $0.50 per share for the full fiscal year and we continue to look for additional opportunities to drive cost down further. The rest of our financial discussion will focus on the results excluding these special items as we believe it provides 1 of the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance. 
Now turning to the P&L, net sales exceeded $2.9 billion, up almost 8% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit dollars were up 4% on a constant currency basis as higher pricing acquisitions were partially offset by higher net commodity costs. As Art mentioned, gross margin was down, along with all of our peers as a result of the commodity cost movements. Marketing expense increased in line with our strong top line growth while SG&A increased at only 1/4 of the rate of sales. SG&A was up 2% on both a reported in constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, incremental talent to support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as Project Keystone. We continue to prioritize investment to support the future while balancing overall costs. In fact, SG&A in our developed markets was down versus the prior year, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls. Operating income was up around 5% on a constant currency basis despite soft results in the U.S. and Italy, as well as incremental investments for marketing and Keystone. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million primarily due to interest expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 26.1% last year primarily due to the relief of foreign tax reserves no longer subject to claims, as well as reduced repatriation costs. We're now anticipating a tax rate for the full year, excluding special charges in the mid to low 20s. This reflects the reserve I just mentioned, as well as other foreign tax planning initiatives. 
At the bottom line, we delivered a net and increase in net income of 12% at EPS of 13% in Q3. Looking at the key components of sales growth, as Art mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 4.6% for the quarter, the highest growth since fiscal 2009. Price improvements of 4.2%, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Latin America, drove this growth, while volume was slightly positive at 0.4%. The Emerging Markets delivered balance organic growth with volume and price both up approximately 10% and the developed markets and Europe posted positive volume with the exception of Italy. Japan had a strong performance, exceeding 10% volume growth this quarter while we saw declines in Canada and Australia, as well as a small decline in the U.S. The Quero net acquisition in the Boston Market added 2.9% our top line while foreign exchange reduced sales by 40 basis points. Our gross margin at 36.4% declined 140 basis points as our pricing and productivity initiatives effectively offset approximately half of the headwinds from the commodity markets. 
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in most of our key raw materials, particularly sweeteners, meals, meat and dairy. The overall result has been market inflation for the quarter of around 7%, in line with our full year expectations. 
Finally, for the quarter, operating free cash flow was about $250 million, down from last year. This reflects a $34 million outflow for productivity initiatives, increased QOWC, particularly receivables driven by growth in Asia and Brazil, while inventory payables were roughly offset each other. Additionally, increased capital spending reflected further investments in Project Keystone, capacity projects in the Emerging Markets and new productivity initiatives. In total, capital expenditures were 3.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Dividends reflect the 6.7% increase that we announced in May. And finally, the increasing Treasury stock reflects the repurchase of about 800,000 shares at a total cost of $42 million, net of options exercised. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard through 9 months. Capital expenditures were 3.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year, reflecting the investments I just mentioned. We're still anticipating spending of around 4% of sales for the full fiscal year. Our cash conversion cycle at 45 days slipped by 1 day versus last year as a 3-day improvement in payables was offset by 2 days in receivables and inventory. Operating free cash flow of $476 million was down from last year. We spent $64 million in our productivity initiatives so far this year, and QOWC has increased primarily due to the timing of payables. Overall, QOWC should be in line with fiscal '11 by year end as a result of our concerted efforts to reduce inventories. 
Additionally, in line with our plans, cash taxes are higher this year and capital spending is up on a year-to-date basis. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.0x this year versus 1.8x last January. The increase was due to higher net debt primarily related to the Brazilian acquisition where we remain quite pleased with improvements in net debt to EBITDA from just a few years ago. ROIC was 18.6%, down 70 basis points from this time last year. But if you adjust for the Brazilian acquisition, the base business, which shown improvement of 20 basis points over the comparable period last year. 
In summary, our performance for this quarter reflects solid top line and EPS growth with substantial incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to take you through our full year outlook"
278212,163462240,259710,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2012",2012-02-17,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Ed. Now let's finish after a quick look at the full year forecast. On the next items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May. Those goals included constant currency sales growth of 7",317,"Thanks, Ed. Now let's finish after a quick look at the full year forecast. On the next items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May. Those goals included constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%; EPS growth of 6% to 8%; and operating free cash flow of around $1.15 billion. As discussed last quarter, given the negative changes in the economic environment, our path is a bit different than we had originally expected. 
On a reported x items basis, we're narrowing our range and expect to deliver EPS of between, $3.32  and $3.34. This includes the full year benefit of approximately $0.05 of foreign currency. Thus, this range should equate to constant currency performance of around $3.27 to $3.29, which is at the middle of our original outlook of $3.24 to $3.32, and this effectively takes up the bottom of our expected range. So as we look forward, we expect to continue our top line momentum, further invest in the business, deliver double-digit EPS growth in Q4 and aggressively reduce inventory levels. As part of this, as Ed mentioned, we now expect our full year tax rate to be in the mid to low 20s. And finally, we expect to deliver $1 billion in operating cash flow on a reported basis after the impact of spending for special items. 
So to summarize, we're posting solid sales in EPS results in a challenging environment, driving the top line primarily through growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and an increase in marketing behind our Top 15 brands; continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite by the environment; successfully executing our productivity initiatives to further build the foundation for the future; and expecting to deliver our original full year outlook. So with that, I'll turn it back to Meg and we'll take your questions. Meg?"

For the quarter, ROI was up nicely and we continue to drive the productivity initiatives. So we're feeling very good about the business. I think what you're seeing in some timing in terms of the tax impacts. Certainly, the tax was better than we expected this quarter, a little bit worse than we expected next quarter, so largely timing there. This allows us flexibility, frankly. I mean, in this tough environment, there's just no reason to be heroic. So I think we are prudently balancing the P&L. We're also aggressively taking out inventory in the fourth quarter, and as you know, as you reduce inventory, you're taking absorption hit. You're pulling basically fixed costs off the balance sheet into the P&L and there's a hit associated with that and we think that's the right thing to do to pull inventory out and to drive cash flow.

I think we're around 10% market inflation at that point, it's down around 7% market inflation. In the third quarter, we do expect that to continue to moderate into the fourth quarter. And the good news is, that over time, we have been getting better price realization. If you recall, particularly in U.S. Foodservice, pricing comes in chunks as National Account contracts come up and things like that. So our price realization is getting better and commodity inflation is moderating. So we do expect sequential improvement from a gross margin standpoint, and so we're looking to finish up the year pretty much as expected on that front."

Reality is, about half of our business in Europe is in the U.K. That business has been going extremely well for us. We're very, very pleased with the execution and the strategy that the guys there have from a marketing and a sales standpoint. So very good performance there. U.K. soup in the quarter was up dramatically, and we're coming out with great innovations, things like Squeeze & Stir, the talking labels. We've got a lot of PR going on, so there's lots of good things going on there. And I just think we're executing extremely well in a tough market. There's no doubt about it. But I think we are advantaged by the fact that the bulk of our business or certainly roughly half of our business is in the U.K. But even beyond the U.K., if you look at what else is working there, Ketchup in Europe, across Europe, is doing extremely well. That has been Driving that for us globally and certainly across Europe, we've talk to you about the performance there in the past and that performance continues to do extremely well and, in fact, accelerate. So Ketchup across Europe is doing well. If you think about Russia, that's a real growth engine for us. Organic sale's up around 19% as I recall in the quarter. So that's a combination of sauces and also baby food. So we feel very good about that. I mean, to your point about Southern Europe, yes, it's a tough environment, no doubt about it. Italy is a tough place to be doing business. We had a truck strike at the end of the third quarter that certainly impeded sales somewhat in Q3. But here again, we're innovating, we're bringing new products out there, we've just got Aseptic which is must much higher quality baby food product that has come out in Italy and it's in the U.K. as well. And as we look forward, we're investing in the supply chain hub there which should bring great manufacturing efficiencies. We're putting in the Heinz Innovation Center which should amp up our ability to innovate across Europe, and finally, Keystone continues to roll out. So net-net, yes, Europe's a tough environment but I think we're doing all right, thanks,."

I mean, Ore-Ida, sales were basically flat for the quarter with price up and volume down. And as we said before, as the leader of that category, we took significant pricing last fall or actually before then, so it's been quite a while. Private label tended to stay down. The result was a bit of a value gap there. Frankly, we can get that share back tomorrow, but what we're trying to do is balance really volume, price, share and margin. I would say elasticity that category IS probably higher than they were originally anticipated. And I think if Bill were here, he would use his old maxim of fix the problem and market fix, so we are addressing it with addressing the value cap of our 2-pound bag. We're also, as you know, launching a 1-pound bag at $1.99. We have high hopes for what that will do for us. And the plan basically is, once we've resolved the value gap, then we'll go back on air from a marketing standpoint to market the fix.

In fact, you're hearing of more companies announcing layoffs and things like that. So with that, we're going to hope for the best and plan for the worst. I think you're seeing more perimeter shopping as people use ingredient cooking. Within the U.S., some people are shifting to more cheaper meals outs and you've seen the benefit of that in some of the QSRs, particularly McDonald's and Subway. But at the end of the day, we're not going to chase share. We could easily buy volume in this kind of market, but I think we're going to continue to try to do the right things, recognize the environment for what it is. I think value means different things to different people, and I believe Bill will expand upon that at CAGNY next week. For some people, volume means lower cost per ounce. For others that are really struggling, it is that entry level price point. So that's what we're trying to address and at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder, we're going to be innovating to meet those needs. It used to be a little simpler and that you could address just the relatively more affluent. Now we need to address now, again, all parts of the ladder and that's what we're doing."

Today, Ed and I will take you to through our Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY. Overall, we're very pleased",1298,"Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, Ed and I will take you to through our Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY. Overall, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter, highlighted by strong top line growth and good P&L leverage. Key facets of the performance for Q3 include strong sales growth, again, driven by Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands; continuing investments in marketing, processes and systems to drive future growth and productivity; and a double-digit increase in EPS, reflecting solid growth in operating income and a better-than-expected tax rate. In short, we drove both top and bottom line growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Turning to our ex items P&L scorecard for the quarter, you can see that currency translation had a negligible effect. Overall, sales grew by more than 7%, operating income increased better than 4% and EPS was up 13%. That's a good result as we continue to increase the investment in our brands and on Project Keystone while tightly controlling other spending. EPS got a boost from the favorable tax rate, which was 20% for the quarter. Again, this was better than expected and added $0.07 to the year-on-year increase in EPS. The most difficult result for the quarter was gross margin. While this margin level represents a continuation of sequential improvement in the business and is our high watermark so far this fiscal year, it was still 140 basis points below last year. And to put this into perspective, our gross margin performance for the quarter was the third best in the peer group. We've left off specific company names here, but you can see that the whole group is working to overcome the harsh commodity inflation buckling the industry. We're obviously not satisfied with this and our expectations are that commodity inflation, while not going away, will continue to moderate, easing the pressure on gross margins somewhat. With that said, let's turn back to the top line story. 
We're very proud of the fact that we've now driven 27 consecutive quarters of organic growth. And this quarter's organic growth of 4.6% represents our highest growth rate in nearly 3 years. Importantly, all segments reported positive organic sales growth in the quarter, led by the Rest of World and Asia/Pacific segments, but also reflecting positive growth in the difficult developed markets of Europe and North America. Again, this quarter, the formula for growth is based on our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands. 
On our last earnings call, we mentioned that growth in Emerging Markets would accelerate in Q3, and that's exactly what happened. For the quarter, Emerging Markets generated very strong organic growth of 20%, and on a reported basis, the number was even stronger, up about 40% when you include sales from the Quero business we bought in Brazil in Q4 last year. Now on an organic basis, growth was driven by Latin America, China, Russia, Indonesia, India and Africa/Middle East. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Global Ketchup as well, where we delivered 9% organic growth, led by Latin America, U.S. Foodservice and Russia. Though smaller in scale, we also posted big percentage gains on Heinz Ketchup in Brazil and in China. And to round out the discussion of our growth engines, the Top 15 brands posted 6% organic growth, led by the Heinz brand, the Master brand of soy sauces in China and our ABC brand in Indonesia. Our Top 15 brands represent more than 70% of global sales and continue to grow as a percentage of our total mix. 
A key to the continued growth in our portfolio is increasing support of our brands. Over a 5-year period ending in fiscal 2011, Heinz increased marketing spending by almost 60% to help drive organic growth, and we're continuing to increase our investment level this fiscal year. Through the first 9 months of FY '12, our spending is up another 10%, reflecting higher spending in both emerging and developed markets. 
Now, let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted stable results in a difficult market with a challenged consumer. Organic sales were up 1%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of Boston Market. Organic sales of frozen products were up in the U.S., while Ore-Ida sales were basically flat. The gains in frozen were partially offset by weaker sales in pasta sauces. Gross margin was impacted by net commodity inflation and lower margin product mix. We effectively leveraged SG&A spending, and we're excited to see the new accessible price point products reaching store shelves in Q4. We'll talk more about that next week at CAGNY. 
U.S. Foodservice business returned to sales and profit growth in Q3, driven by branded front-of-house products and continuing productivity initiatives. Importantly, Dip & Squeeze distribution continues to expand and is now available at Wendy's. With this addition, Dip & Squeeze already represents about 25% of our total branded portion control Ketchup business in the United States. The industry saw modest improvement in overall restaurant traffic, particularly in December, driven largely by quick serve restaurants, though traffic at some of our key customers is still down slightly. Gross margin strengthened sequentially but was still below prior year as net pricing has increased and commodity inflation is beginning to moderate. And finally, we continue to rationalize the factory footprint in order to drive down fixed costs. 
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz Europe posted solid results, with constant currency sales up over 4% and operating income about flat. Organic growth for the region was driven by another strong quarter in the U.K., up 6%, and continuing momentum in Russia, up 19%. Italy, on the other hand, was impacted by the country's debt crisis and incurred a 3-day national truck strike at the end of our quarter in late January. We continue to invest in processes and systems across Europe and are very pleased with ongoing progress in the rollout of Project Keystone and the establishment of the European supply chain hub and new Innovation Center. 
Turning to the Asia/Pacific, that region posted nearly 7% constant currency sales growth and almost 23% operating income growth, a dramatic improvement from their results last quarter. Each emerging market in the region drove double-digit sales growth, led by China, Indonesia and India. China is generating particularly good growth in Foodstar, western sauces and Infant/Nutrition. Operating income improvement for the segment was led by excellent growth in China, Japan and Indonesia. We also saw a sequential improvement in Australia this quarter, driven by new leadership there. 
Turning to the Rest of World segment, on a constant currency basis, both sales and operating income more than doubled. This growth was driven by continued strong performance in Latin America. A key element here is the addition of the Quero brand in Brazil where the quarter sales in Brazil exceeded $100 million. Notably, we began distributing Heinz Ketchup in Brazil through the Quero sales force and have seen Ketchup sales almost double. Though still small, we have high expectations for this Ketchup business. Adding to the growth story Latin America, we recently launched new baby food and ketchup pouches in Mexico and Central America. They're off to a great start, and we think this will be an important packaging innovation for cash-strapped consumers. And finally, Africa/Middle East contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter as well. 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ed for a bit deeper insight on the quarter. Ed?"

I'll take you through some of the details underlying our financial results which reflect strong top line and bottom line growth. Let's look first at EPS. Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for the special charges related to our productivity initiatives. To summarize Q3, going from right to left, including the $0.07 cost of our productivity initiatives, reported EPS was $0.88, up $0.04 or almost 5% from last year. Our constant currency EPS and EPS excluding special charges were both $0.95, up 13.1% as foreign exchange activity this quarter had virtually no impact on the bottom line. Here, you can see the components of our productivity charges and where they're reflected in the P&L. 
In Q3, we incurred $9 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce, $11 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of 6 factories so far this year, and we're working towards exiting at least 2 more factories by year end. $14 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees, contract termination and relocation costs, incurred to improve manufacturing efficiencies, most notably affecting our Australian business. 
Overall, we recorded charges of $34 million pretax, of which $22 million is in cost of goods sold and $12 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of the charges was $23 million or $0.07 per share, and the entire amount was reported in our non-operating segment. As a reminder, we currently expect the total cost of these initiatives to be around $215 million pretax or $0.50 per share for the full fiscal year, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to drive cost down further. The rest of our financial discussion will focus on the results excluding these special items as we believe it provides the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance. 
Now turning to the P&L. Net sales exceeded $2.9 billion, up almost 8% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit dollars were up 4% on a constant currency basis as higher pricing and acquisitions were partially offset by higher net commodity costs. As Art mentioned, gross margin was down, along with all of our peers as a result of the commodity cost movements. Marketing expense increased in line with our strong top line growth while SG&A increased at only 1/4 of the rate of sales. SG&A was up 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, incremental talent to support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as Project Keystone. We continue to prioritize investment to support the future while balancing overall costs. In fact, SG&A in our developed markets was down versus the prior year, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls. 
Operating income was up around 5% on a constant currency basis despite soft results in the U.S. and Italy, as well as incremental investments for marketing and Keystone. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million primarily due to interest expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 26.1% last year primarily due to the release of foreign tax reserves no longer subject to claims, as well as reduced repatriation costs. We're now anticipating a tax rate for the full year, excluding special charges, in the mid to low 20s. This reflects the reserve I just mentioned, as well as other foreign tax planning initiatives. At the bottom line, we delivered a net -- an increase in net income of 12% and EPS of 13% in Q3. 
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as Art mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 4.6% for the quarter, the highest growth since fiscal 2009. Price improvements of 4.2%, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Latin America, drove this growth, while volume was slightly positive at 0.4%. The Emerging Markets delivered balanced organic growth, with volume and price both up approximately 10%, and the developed markets in Europe posted positive volume with the exception of Italy. Japan had a strong performance, exceeding 10% volume growth this quarter, while we saw declines in Canada and Australia, as well as a small decline in the U.S. The Quero net acquisition, net of Boston Market added 2.9% to our top line, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 40 basis points. Our gross margin at 36.4% declined 140 basis points as our pricing and productivity initiatives effectively offset approximately half of the headwinds from the commodity markets. 
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in most of our key raw materials, particularly sweeteners, metals, meat and dairy. The overall result has been market inflation for the quarter of around 7%, in line with our full year expectations. 
Finally, for the quarter, operating free cash flow was about $250 million, down from last year. This reflects a $34 million outflow for productivity initiatives, increased QOWC, particularly receivables driven by growth in Asia and Brazil, while inventory and payables will roughly offset each other. Additionally, increased capital spending reflected further investments in Project Keystone, capacity projects in the Emerging Markets and new productivity initiatives. In total, capital expenditures were 3.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Dividends reflect a 6.7% increase that we announced in May. And finally, the increase in treasury stock reflects the repurchase of about 800,000 shares at a total cost of $42 million, net of options exercised. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard through 9 months. Capital expenditures were 3.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year, reflecting the investments I just mentioned. We're still anticipating spending of around 4% of sales for the full fiscal year. Our cash conversion cycle at 45 days slipped by 1 day versus last year as a 3-day improvement in payables was offset by 2 days in receivables and inventory. Operating free cash flow of $476 million was down from last year. We spent $64 million in our productivity initiatives so far this year, and QOWC has increased primarily due to the timing of payables. Overall, QOWC should be in line with fiscal '11 by year end as a result of our concerted efforts to reduce inventories. 
Additionally, in line with our plans, cash taxes are higher this year, and capital spending is up on a year-to-date basis. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.0x this year versus 1.8x last January. The increase was due to higher net debt primarily related to the Brazilian acquisition where we remain quite pleased with the improvements in net debt to EBITDA from just a few years ago. ROIC was 18.6%, down 70 basis points from this time last year. But if you adjust for the Brazilian acquisition, the base business, which show an improvement of 20 basis points over the comparable period last year. 
In summary, our performance for this quarter reflects solid top line and EPS growth, with substantial incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to take you through our full-year outlook."

On an ex items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May. Those goals included constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%, EPS growth of 6% to 8% and operating free cash flow of around $1.15 billion. As discussed last quarter, given the negative changes in the economic environment, our path is a bit different than we had originally expected. 
On a reported ex items basis, we're narrowing our range and expect to deliver EPS of between $3.32  and $3.34. This includes the full-year benefit of approximately $0.05 from foreign currency. Thus, this range should equate to constant currency performance of around $3.27 to $3.29, which is at the middle of our original outlook of $3.24 to $3.32. And this effectively takes up the bottom of our expected range. 
So as we look forward, we expect to continue our top line momentum, further invest in the business, deliver double-digit EPS growth in Q4 and aggressively reduce inventory levels. As part of this, as Ed mentioned, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be in the mid to low 20s. And finally, we expect to deliver $1 billion in operating free cash flow on a reported basis after the impact of spending for special items. 
So to summarize, we're posting solid sales in EPS results in a challenging environment, driving the top line primarily through growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and an increase in marketing behind our Top 15 brands, continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment, successfully executing our productivity initiatives to further build the foundation for the future and expecting to deliver our original full-year outlook.

For the quarter, ROI was up nicely, and we continue to drive the productivity initiatives. So we're feeling very good about the business. I think what you're seeing is some timing in terms of the tax impacts. Certainly, the tax was better than we expected this quarter, a little bit worse than we expected next quarter, so largely timing there. This allows us flexibility, frankly. I mean, in this tough environment, there is just no reason to be heroic. So I think we are prudently balancing the P&L. We're also aggressively taking out inventory in the fourth quarter. And as you know, as you reduce inventory, you're taking absorption hit. You're pulling basically fixed costs off the balance sheet into the P&L. And there's a hit associated with that, but we think that's the right thing to do to pull inventory out and to drive cash flow.

And the good news is, that over time, we have been getting better price realization. If you recall, particularly in U.S. Foodservice, pricing comes in chunks as national account contracts come up and things like that. So our price realization is getting better, and commodity inflation is moderating. So we do expect sequential improvement from a gross margin standpoint. And so we're looking to finish up the year pretty much as expected on that front."

At this point, I'm probably not going to say a lot about '13, but let me just give you a flavor for how we're thinking about Europe and what's going on there. Reality is, about half of our business in Europe is in the U.K. That business has been going extremely well for us. We're very, very pleased with the execution and the strategy that the guys there have from a marketing and a sales standpoint. So very good performance there. U.K. soup in the quarter was up dramatically. We're coming out with great innovations, things like Squeeze & Stir, the Talking Labels. We've got a lot of PR going on, so there's lots of good things going on there. And I just think we are executing extremely well in a tough market. There's no doubt about it. But I think we are advantaged by the fact that the bulk of our business or certainly roughly half of our business is in the U.K. But even beyond the U.K., if you look at what else is working there, Ketchup in Europe, across Europe, is doing extremely well. Rolling airboat [ph] has been driving that for us globally and certainly across Europe. And we've talked to you about the performance there in the past, and that performance continues to do extremely well and, in fact, accelerate. So Ketchup across Europe is doing well. If you think about Russia, that's a real growth engine for us. Organic sale is up around 19%, as I recall, in the quarter. So that's a combination of sauces and also baby food. So we feel very good about that. I mean, to your point about Southern Europe, yes, it's a tough environment, no doubt about it. Italy is a tough place to be doing business. We had a truck strike at the end of the third quarter that certainly impeded the sales somewhat in Q3. But here again, we're innovating, we're bringing new products out there, we've just got Aseptic, which is a much higher quality baby food product that has come out in Italy and that's in the U.K. as well. And as we look forward, we're investing in the supply chain hub there, which should bring great manufacturing efficiencies. We're putting in the Heinz Innovation Center, which should amp up our ability to innovate across Europe. And finally, Keystone continues to roll out. So net-net, yes, Europe is a tough environment, but I think we're doing all right, thanks."

Result was a bit of a value gap there. And frankly, we could get that share back tomorrow, but what we're trying to do is balance really volume, price share and margin. I would say elasticity in that category is probably higher than we'd originally anticipated. And I think if Bill were here, he would use his old maximum of fix the problem and market the fix. So we're addressing it with -- addressing the value gap on our 2-pound bag. We're also, as you know, launching a 1-pound bag at $1.99. We have high hopes for what that will do for us. And the plan basically is, once we've resolved the value gap, then we'll go back on air from a marketing standpoint to market the fix.

In fact, you're hearing more companies announcing layoffs and things like that. So with that, we're going to hope for the best and plan for the worst. I think you're seeing more perimeter shopping as people use ingredient cooking. Within the U.S., some people are shifting to more cheaper meals out, and you've seen the benefit of that in some of the QSRs, particularly McDonald's and SUBWAY. But at the end of the day, we're not going to chase share. We could easily buy volume in this kind of market. But I think we're going to continue to try to do the right things, recognize the environment for what it is. I think value means different things to different people, and I believe Bill will expand upon that at CAGNY next week. For some people, volume means lower cost per ounce. For others that are really struggling, it is that entry level price point. And so that's what we're trying to address. And at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder, we're going to be innovating to meet those needs. It used to be a little simpler and that you could address just the relatively more affluent.

Good morning, everyone. Today, Ed and I will take you to through our Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY.
Overall, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter, highlighted by strong top line growth and good P&L leverage. Key facets of the performance for Q3 include strong sales growth, again driven by Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands; continuing investments in marketing, processes and systems to drive future growth and productivity; and a double-digit increase in EPS, reflecting solid growth in operating income and a better-than-expected tax rate. In short, we drove both top and bottom line growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Turning to our ex items P&L scorecard for the quarter, you can see that currency translation had a negligible effect. Overall, sales grew by more than 7%, operating income increased better than 4% and EPS was up 13%. That's a good result as we continue to increase the investment in our brands and on Project Keystone while tightly controlling other spending. EPS got a boost from the favorable tax rate, which was 20% for the quarter. Again, this was better than expected and added $0.07 to the year-on-year increase in EPS.
The most difficult result for the quarter was gross margin. While this margin level represents a continuation of sequential improvement in the business and is our high-water mark so far this fiscal year, it was still 140 basis points below last year.
And to put this into perspective, our gross margin performance for the quarter was the third best in the peer group. We've left off specific company names here, but you can see that the whole group is working to overcome the harsh commodity inflation buffeting the industry. We're obviously not satisfied with this and our expectations are that commodity inflation, while not going away, will continue to moderate, easing the pressure on gross margins somewhat.
With that said, let's turn back to the top line story. We're very proud of the fact that we've now driven 27 consecutive quarters of organic growth. And this quarter's organic growth of 4.6% represents our highest growth rate in nearly 3 years.
Importantly, all segments reported positive organic sales growth in the quarter, led by the Rest of World and Asia/Pacific segments, but also reflecting positive growth in the difficult developed markets of Europe and North America. Again, this quarter, the formula for growth is based on our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands. 
On our last earnings call, we mentioned that growth in Emerging Markets would accelerate in Q3, and that's exactly what happened. For the quarter, Emerging Markets generated very strong organic growth of 20%, and on a reported basis, the number was even stronger, up about 40% when you include sales from the Quero business we bought in Brazil in Q4 last year. Now on an organic basis, growth was driven by Latin America, China, Russia, Indonesia, India and Africa/Middle East. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Global Ketchup as well, where we delivered 9% organic growth, led by Latin America, U.S. Foodservice and Russia. Though smaller in scale, we also posted big percentage gains on Heinz Ketchup in Brazil and in China.
And to round out the discussion of our growth engines, the Top 15 brands posted 6% organic growth, led by the Heinz brand, the Master brand of soy sauces in China and our ABC brand in Indonesia. Our Top 15 brands represent more than 70% of global sales and continue to grow as a percentage of our total mix. 
A key to the continued growth in our portfolio is increasing support of our brands. Over a 5-year period ending in fiscal 2011, Heinz increased marketing spending by almost 60% to help drive organic growth, and we're continuing to increase our investment level this fiscal year.
Through the first 9 months of FY '12, our spending is up another 10%, reflecting higher spending in both emerging and developed markets. 
Now, let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted stable results in a difficult market with a challenged consumer. Organic sales were up 1%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of Boston Market. Organic sales of frozen products were up in the U.S., while Ore-Ida sales were basically flat. The gains in frozen were partially offset by weaker sales in pasta sauces. Gross margin was impacted by net commodity inflation and lower margin product mix. We effectively leveraged SG&A spending, and we're excited to see the new accessible price point products reaching store shelves in Q4. We'll talk more about that next week at CAGNY. 
U.S. Foodservice business returned to sales and profit growth in Q3, driven by branded/front-of-house products and continuing productivity initiatives. Importantly, Dip & Squeeze distribution continues to expand and is now available at Wendy's. With this addition, Dip & Squeeze already represents about 25% of our total branded portion control Ketchup business in the United States. The industry saw modest improvement in overall restaurant traffic, particularly in December, driven largely by quick serve restaurants, though traffic at some of our key customers is still down slightly. Gross margin strengthened sequentially but was still below prior year as net pricing has increased and commodity inflation is beginning to moderate. And finally, we continue to rationalize the factory footprint in order to drive down fixed costs. 
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz Europe posted solid results, with constant currency sales up over 4% and operating income about flat. Organic growth for the region was driven by another strong quarter in the U.K., up 6%, and continuing momentum in Russia, up 19%. Italy, on the other hand, was impacted by the country's debt crisis and incurred a 3-day national truck strike at the end of our quarter in late January. We continue to invest in processes and systems across Europe and are very pleased with ongoing progress in the rollout of Project Keystone and the establishment of the European supply chain hub and new Innovation Center. 
Turning to the Asia/Pacific, that region posted nearly 7% constant currency sales growth and almost 23% operating income growth, a dramatic improvement from their results last quarter. Each emerging market in the region drove double-digit sales growth, led by China, Indonesia and India. China is generating particularly good growth in Foodstar, western sauces and infant nutrition. Operating income improvement for the segment was led by excellent growth in China, Japan and Indonesia. We also saw sequential improvement in Australia this quarter, driven by new leadership there. 
Turning to the Rest of World segment, on a constant currency basis, both sales and operating income more than doubled. This growth was driven by continued strong performance in Latin America. A key element here is the addition of the Quero brand in Brazil, where the quarter sales in Brazil exceeded $100 million. Notably, we began distributing Heinz Ketchup in Brazil through the Quero sales force and have seen Ketchup sales almost double. Though still small, we have high expectations for this Ketchup business. Adding to the growth story in Latin America, we recently launched new baby food and ketchup pouches in Mexico and Central America. They're off to a great start, and we think this will be an important packaging innovation for cash-strapped consumers. And finally, Africa/Middle East contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter as well. 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ed for a bit deeper insight on the quarter. Ed?"

Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're rep",1183,"Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some of the details underlying our financial results, which reflect strong top line and bottom line growth.
Let's look first at EPS. Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for the special charges related to our productivity initiatives. To summarize Q3, going from right to left, including the $0.07 cost of our productivity initiatives, reported EPS was $0.88, up $0.04 or almost 5% from last year. Our constant currency EPS and EPS excluding special charges were both $0.95, up 13.1% as foreign exchange activity this quarter had virtually no impact on the bottom line.
Here, you can see the components of our productivity charges and where they're reflected in the P&L. In Q3, we incurred $9 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce; $11 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of 6 factories so far this year, and we're working towards exiting at least 2 more factories by year end; $14 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees, contract termination and relocation costs, incurred to improve manufacturing efficiencies, most notably affecting our Australian business. 
Overall, we recorded charges of $34 million pretax, of which $22 million is in cost of goods sold and $12 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of the charges was $23 million or $0.07 per share, and the entire amount was reported in our non-operating segment. As a reminder, we currently expect the total cost of these initiatives to be around $215 million pretax or $0.50 per share for the full fiscal year, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to drive cost down further. The rest of our financial discussion will focus on the results excluding these special items, as we believe it provides the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance. 
Now turning to the P&L. Net sales exceeded $2.9 billion, up almost 8% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit dollars were up 4% on a constant currency basis as higher pricing and acquisitions were partially offset by higher net commodity costs. As Art mentioned, gross margin was down, along with all of our peers as a result of the commodity cost movements. Marketing expense increased in line with our strong top line growth while SG&A increased at only 1/4 of the rate of sales. SG&A was up 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, incremental talent to support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as Project Keystone. We continue to prioritize investment to support the future while balancing overall costs. In fact, SG&A in our developed markets was down versus the prior year, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls. 
Operating income was up around 5% on a constant currency basis despite soft results in the U.S. and Italy, as well as incremental investments for marketing and Keystone. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million, primarily due to interest expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 26.1% last year primarily due to the release of foreign tax reserves no longer subject to claims, as well as reduced repatriation costs. We're now anticipating a tax rate for the full year, excluding special charges, in the mid to low 20s. This reflects the reserve I just mentioned, as well as other foreign tax planning initiatives. At the bottom line, we delivered a net -- an increase in net income of 12% and EPS of 13% in Q3. 
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as Art mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 4.6% for the quarter, the highest growth since fiscal 2009. Price improvements of 4.2%, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Latin America, drove this growth, while volume was slightly positive at 0.4%. The Emerging Markets delivered balanced organic growth, with volume and price both up approximately 10%, and the developed markets in Europe posted positive volume with the exception of Italy. Japan had a strong performance, exceeding 10% volume growth this quarter, while we saw declines in Canada and Australia, as well as a small decline in the U.S. The Quero net acquisition, net of Boston Market, added 2.9% to our top line, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 40 basis points.
Our gross margin at 36.4% declined 140 basis points as our pricing and productivity initiatives effectively offset approximately half of the headwinds from the commodity markets.
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in most of our key raw materials, particularly sweeteners, metals, meat and dairy. The overall result has been market inflation for the quarter of around 7%, in line with our full year expectations. 
Finally, for the quarter, operating free cash flow was about $250 million, down from last year. This reflects a $34-million outflow for productivity initiatives, increased QOWC, particularly receivables driven by growth in Asia and Brazil, while inventory and payables will roughly offset each other. Additionally, increased capital spending reflected further investments in Project Keystone, capacity projects in the Emerging Markets and new productivity initiatives. In total, capital expenditures were 3.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Dividends reflect a 6.7% increase that we announced in May. And finally, the increase in treasury stock reflects the repurchase of about 800,000 shares at a total cost of $42 million, net of options exercised. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard through 9 months. Capital expenditures were 3.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year, reflecting the investments I just mentioned. We're still anticipating spending of around 4% of sales for the full fiscal year. Our cash conversion cycle at 45 days slipped by 1 day versus last year as a 3-day improvement in payables was offset by 2 days in receivables and inventory. Operating free cash flow of $476 million was down from last year. We spent $64 million in our productivity initiatives so far this year, and QOWC has increased primarily due to the timing of payables. Overall, QOWC should be in line with fiscal '11 by year end as a result of our concerted efforts to reduce inventories. 
Additionally, in line with our plans, cash taxes are higher this year, and capital spending is up on a year-to-date basis. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.0x this year versus 1.8x last January. The increase was due to higher net debt primarily related to the Brazilian acquisition, but we remain quite pleased with the improvements in net debt to EBITDA from just a few years ago. ROIC was 18.6%, down 70 basis points from this time last year. But if you adjust for the Brazilian acquisition, the base business would show an improvement of 20 basis points over the comparable period last year. 
In summary, our performance for this quarter reflects solid top line and EPS growth, with substantial incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to take you through our full-year outlook."

Now let's finish after a quick look at the full year forecast. On an ex items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May.

On an ex items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May. Those goals included constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%, EPS growth of 6% to 8% and operating free cash flow of around $1.15 billion. As discussed last quarter, given the negative changes in the economic environment, our path is a bit different than we had originally expected. 
On a reported ex items basis, we're narrowing our range and expect to deliver EPS of between $3.32 and $3.34. This includes the full year benefit of approximately $0.05 from foreign currency. Thus, this range should equate to constant currency performance of around $3.27 to $3.29, which is at the middle of our original outlook of $3.24 to $3.32. And this effectively takes up the bottom of our expected range. 
So as we look forward, we expect to continue our top line momentum, further invest in the business, deliver double-digit EPS growth in Q4 and aggressively reduce inventory levels. As part of this, as Ed mentioned, we now expect our full year tax rate to be in the mid to low 20s. And finally, we expect to deliver $1 billion in operating free cash flow on a reported basis after the impact of spending for special items. 
So to summarize, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment; driving the top line primarily through growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and an increase in marketing behind our Top 15 brands; continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment; successfully executing our productivity initiatives to further build the foundation for the future; and expecting to deliver our original full year outlook.

For the quarter, ROI was up nicely, and we continue to drive the productivity initiatives. So we're feeling very good about the business. I think what you're seeing is some timing in terms of the tax impact. Certainly, the tax was better than we expected this quarter, probably a little bit worse than we expected next quarter, so largely timing there. This allows us flexibility, frankly. I mean, in this tough environment, there is just no reason to be heroic. So I think we are prudently balancing the P&L. We're also aggressively taking out inventory in the fourth quarter. And as you know, as you reduce inventory, you take an absorption hit. You're pulling basically fixed costs off the balance sheet into the P&L and there's a hit associated with that, but we think that's the right thing to do, to pull inventory out and to drive cash flow. So now, we feel very good about the business and feel very good about the fact that we're taking it to the middle of the range and taking up the bottom end of our guidance."

At this point, I'm probably not going to say a lot about '13, but let me just give you a flavor for how we're thinking about Europe and what's going on there. Reality is, about half of our business in Europe is in the U.K. That business has been going extremely well for us. We're very, very pleased with the execution and the strategy that the guys there have from a marketing and a sales standpoint. So very good performance there. U.K. soup in the quarter was up dramatically. We're coming out with great innovations, things like Squeeze & Stir, the Talking Labels. We've got a lot of PR going on, so there's lots of good things going on there. And I just think we are executing extremely well in a tough market. There's no doubt about it. But I think we are advantaged by the fact that the bulk of our business or certainly roughly half of our business is in the U.K. But even beyond the U.K., if you look at what else is working there, Ketchup in Europe, across Europe, is doing extremely well. Rolling airboats [ph] has been driving that for us globally and certainly across Europe. And we've talked to you about the performance there in the past, and that performance continues to do extremely well and, in fact, accelerate. So Ketchup across Europe is doing well. If you think about Russia, that's a real growth engine for us. Organic sales up around 19%, as I recall, in the quarter. So that's a combination of sauces and also baby food. So we feel very good about that. I mean, to your point about Southern Europe, yes, it's a tough environment, no doubt about it. Italy is a tough place to be doing business. We had a truck strike at the end of the third quarter that certainly impeded sales somewhat in Q3. But here again, we're innovating. We're bringing new products out there. We've just got Aseptic, which is a much higher quality baby food product that has come out in Italy and that's in the U.K. as well. And as we look forward, we're investing in the supply chain hub there, which should bring great manufacturing efficiencies. We're putting in the Heinz Innovation Center, which should amp up our ability to innovate across Europe. And finally, Keystone continues to roll out. So net-net, yes, Europe is a tough environment, but I think we're doing all the right things."

I would say elasticity in that category is probably higher than we'd originally anticipated. And I think if Bill were here, he would use his old maximum of fix the problem and market the fix.

But at the end of the day, we're not going to chase share. We could easily buy volume in this kind of market. But I think we're going to continue to try to do the right things, recognize the environment for what it is. I think value means different things to different people, and I believe Bill will expand upon that at CAGNY next week. For some people, volume means lower cost per ounce. For others that are really struggling, it is that entry level price point. And so that's what we're trying to address. And at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder, we're going to be innovating to meet those needs. It used to be a little simpler in that you could address just the relatively more affluent.

Today, Ed and I will take you to through our Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY.Overall, we're very pleased",1298,"Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, Ed and I will take you to through our Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY.
Overall, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter, highlighted by strong top line growth and good P&L leverage. Key facets of the performance for Q3 include strong sales growth, again driven by Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands; continuing investments in marketing, processes and systems to drive future growth and productivity; and a double-digit increase in EPS, reflecting solid growth in operating income and a better-than-expected tax rate. In short, we drove both top and bottom line growth despite a very challenging environment in developed markets. 
Turning to our ex items P&L scorecard for the quarter, you can see that currency translation had a negligible effect. Overall, sales grew by more than 7%, operating income increased better than 4% and EPS was up 13%. That's a good result as we continue to increase the investment in our brands and on Project Keystone while tightly controlling other spending. EPS got a boost from the favorable tax rate, which was 20% for the quarter. Again, this was better than expected and added $0.07 to the year-on-year increase in EPS.
The most difficult result for the quarter was gross margin. While this margin level represents a continuation of sequential improvement in the business and is our high-water mark so far this fiscal year, it was still 140 basis points below last year.
And to put this into perspective, our gross margin performance for the quarter was the third best in the peer group. We've left off specific company names here, but you can see that the whole group is working to overcome the harsh commodity inflation buffeting the industry. We're obviously not satisfied with this and our expectations are that commodity inflation, while not going away, will continue to moderate, easing the pressure on gross margins somewhat.
With that said, let's turn back to the top line story. We're very proud of the fact that we've now driven 27 consecutive quarters of organic growth. And this quarter's organic growth of 4.6% represents our highest growth rate in nearly 3 years.
Importantly, all segments reported positive organic sales growth in the quarter, led by the Rest of World and Asia/Pacific segments, but also reflecting positive growth in the difficult developed markets of Europe and North America. Again, this quarter, the formula for growth is based on our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands. 
On our last earnings call, we mentioned that growth in Emerging Markets would accelerate in Q3, and that's exactly what happened. For the quarter, Emerging Markets generated very strong organic growth of 20%, and on a reported basis, the number was even stronger, up about 40% when you include sales from the Quero business we bought in Brazil in Q4 last year. Now on an organic basis, growth was driven by Latin America, China, Russia, Indonesia, India and Africa/Middle East. 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Global Ketchup as well, where we delivered 9% organic growth, led by Latin America, U.S. Foodservice and Russia. Though smaller in scale, we also posted big percentage gains on Heinz Ketchup in Brazil and in China.
And to round out the discussion of our growth engines, the Top 15 brands posted 6% organic growth, led by the Heinz brand, the Master brand of soy sauces in China and our ABC brand in Indonesia. Our Top 15 brands represent more than 70% of global sales and continue to grow as a percentage of our total mix. 
A key to the continued growth in our portfolio is increasing support of our brands. Over a 5-year period ending in fiscal 2011, Heinz increased marketing spending by almost 60% to help drive organic growth, and we're continuing to increase our investment level this fiscal year.
Through the first 9 months of FY '12, our spending is up another 10%, reflecting higher spending in both emerging and developed markets. 
Now, let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American Consumer Products, we posted stable results in a difficult market with a challenged consumer. Organic sales were up 1%, offset by a 2% impact from the exit of Boston Market. Organic sales of frozen products were up in the U.S., while Ore-Ida sales were basically flat. The gains in frozen were partially offset by weaker sales in pasta sauces. Gross margin was impacted by net commodity inflation and lower margin product mix. We effectively leveraged SG&A spending, and we're excited to see the new accessible price point products reaching store shelves in Q4. We'll talk more about that next week at CAGNY. 
U.S. Foodservice business returned to sales and profit growth in Q3, driven by branded/front-of-house products and continuing productivity initiatives. Importantly, Dip & Squeeze distribution continues to expand and is now available at Wendy's. With this addition, Dip & Squeeze already represents about 25% of our total branded portion control Ketchup business in the United States. The industry saw modest improvement in overall restaurant traffic, particularly in December, driven largely by quick serve restaurants, though traffic at some of our key customers is still down slightly. Gross margin strengthened sequentially but was still below prior year as net pricing has increased and commodity inflation is beginning to moderate. And finally, we continue to rationalize the factory footprint in order to drive down fixed costs. 
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz Europe posted solid results, with constant currency sales up over 4% and operating income about flat. Organic growth for the region was driven by another strong quarter in the U.K., up 6%, and continuing momentum in Russia, up 19%. Italy, on the other hand, was impacted by the country's debt crisis and incurred a 3-day national truck strike at the end of our quarter in late January. We continue to invest in processes and systems across Europe and are very pleased with ongoing progress in the rollout of Project Keystone and the establishment of the European supply chain hub and new Innovation Center. 
Turning to the Asia/Pacific, that region posted nearly 7% constant currency sales growth and almost 23% operating income growth, a dramatic improvement from their results last quarter. Each emerging market in the region drove double-digit sales growth, led by China, Indonesia and India. China is generating particularly good growth in Foodstar, western sauces and infant nutrition. Operating income improvement for the segment was led by excellent growth in China, Japan and Indonesia. We also saw sequential improvement in Australia this quarter, driven by new leadership there. 
Turning to the Rest of World segment, on a constant currency basis, both sales and operating income more than doubled. This growth was driven by continued strong performance in Latin America. A key element here is the addition of the Quero brand in Brazil, where the quarter sales in Brazil exceeded $100 million. Notably, we began distributing Heinz Ketchup in Brazil through the Quero sales force and have seen Ketchup sales almost double. Though still small, we have high expectations for this Ketchup business. Adding to the growth story in Latin America, we recently launched new baby food and ketchup pouches in Mexico and Central America. They're off to a great start, and we think this will be an important packaging innovation for cash-strapped consumers. And finally, Africa/Middle East contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter as well. 
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ed for a bit deeper insight on the quarter. Ed?"

Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're rep",1183,"Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some of the details underlying our financial results, which reflect strong top line and bottom line growth.
Let's look first at EPS. Consistent with our previous releases this year, we're reporting our results in fiscal 2012 adjusting for the special charges related to our productivity initiatives. To summarize Q3, going from right to left, including the $0.07 cost of our productivity initiatives, reported EPS was $0.88, up $0.04 or almost 5% from last year. Our constant currency EPS and EPS excluding special charges were both $0.95, up 13.1% as foreign exchange activity this quarter had virtually no impact on the bottom line.
Here, you can see the components of our productivity charges and where they're reflected in the P&L. In Q3, we incurred $9 million for severance and employee benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce; $11 million related to asset write-offs for the closure of 6 factories so far this year, and we're working towards exiting at least 2 more factories by year end; $14 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees, contract termination and relocation costs, incurred to improve manufacturing efficiencies, most notably affecting our Australian business. 
Overall, we recorded charges of $34 million pretax, of which $22 million is in cost of goods sold and $12 million in SG&A. The after-tax impact of the charges was $23 million or $0.07 per share, and the entire amount was reported in our non-operating segment. As a reminder, we currently expect the total cost of these initiatives to be around $215 million pretax or $0.50 per share for the full fiscal year, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to drive cost down further. The rest of our financial discussion will focus on the results excluding these special items, as we believe it provides the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance. 
Now turning to the P&L. Net sales exceeded $2.9 billion, up almost 8% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit dollars were up 4% on a constant currency basis as higher pricing and acquisitions were partially offset by higher net commodity costs. As Art mentioned, gross margin was down, along with all of our peers as a result of the commodity cost movements. Marketing expense increased in line with our strong top line growth while SG&A increased at only 1/4 of the rate of sales. SG&A was up 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, reflecting increases from acquisitions, incremental talent to support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as Project Keystone. We continue to prioritize investment to support the future while balancing overall costs. In fact, SG&A in our developed markets was down versus the prior year, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls. 
Operating income was up around 5% on a constant currency basis despite soft results in the U.S. and Italy, as well as incremental investments for marketing and Keystone. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million, primarily due to interest expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 26.1% last year primarily due to the release of foreign tax reserves no longer subject to claims, as well as reduced repatriation costs. We're now anticipating a tax rate for the full year, excluding special charges, in the mid to low 20s. This reflects the reserve I just mentioned, as well as other foreign tax planning initiatives. At the bottom line, we delivered a net -- an increase in net income of 12% and EPS of 13% in Q3. 
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as Art mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 4.6% for the quarter, the highest growth since fiscal 2009. Price improvements of 4.2%, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and Latin America, drove this growth, while volume was slightly positive at 0.4%. The Emerging Markets delivered balanced organic growth, with volume and price both up approximately 10%, and the developed markets in Europe posted positive volume with the exception of Italy. Japan had a strong performance, exceeding 10% volume growth this quarter, while we saw declines in Canada and Australia, as well as a small decline in the U.S. The Quero net acquisition, net of Boston Market, added 2.9% to our top line, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 40 basis points.
Our gross margin at 36.4% declined 140 basis points as our pricing and productivity initiatives effectively offset approximately half of the headwinds from the commodity markets.
Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen inflation in most of our key raw materials, particularly sweeteners, metals, meat and dairy. The overall result has been market inflation for the quarter of around 7%, in line with our full year expectations. 
Finally, for the quarter, operating free cash flow was about $250 million, down from last year. This reflects a $34-million outflow for productivity initiatives, increased QOWC, particularly receivables driven by growth in Asia and Brazil, while inventory and payables will roughly offset each other. Additionally, increased capital spending reflected further investments in Project Keystone, capacity projects in the Emerging Markets and new productivity initiatives. In total, capital expenditures were 3.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Dividends reflect a 6.7% increase that we announced in May. And finally, the increase in treasury stock reflects the repurchase of about 800,000 shares at a total cost of $42 million, net of options exercised. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard through 9 months. Capital expenditures were 3.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year, reflecting the investments I just mentioned. We're still anticipating spending of around 4% of sales for the full fiscal year. Our cash conversion cycle at 45 days slipped by 1 day versus last year as a 3-day improvement in payables was offset by 2 days in receivables and inventory. Operating free cash flow of $476 million was down from last year. We spent $64 million in our productivity initiatives so far this year, and QOWC has increased primarily due to the timing of payables. Overall, QOWC should be in line with fiscal '11 by year end as a result of our concerted efforts to reduce inventories. 
Additionally, in line with our plans, cash taxes are higher this year, and capital spending is up on a year-to-date basis. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.0x this year versus 1.8x last January. The increase was due to higher net debt primarily related to the Brazilian acquisition, but we remain quite pleased with the improvements in net debt to EBITDA from just a few years ago. ROIC was 18.6%, down 70 basis points from this time last year. But if you adjust for the Brazilian acquisition, the base business would show an improvement of 20 basis points over the comparable period last year. 
In summary, our performance for this quarter reflects solid top line and EPS growth, with substantial incremental investments back into our business to help support future growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to take you through our full-year outlook."

Now let's finish after a quick look at the full year forecast. On an ex items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May.

On an ex items basis, we're confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last May. Those goals included constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%, EPS growth of 6% to 8% and operating free cash flow of around $1.15 billion. As discussed last quarter, given the negative changes in the economic environment, our path is a bit different than we had originally expected. 
On a reported ex items basis, we're narrowing our range and expect to deliver EPS of between $3.32 and $3.34. This includes the full year benefit of approximately $0.05 from foreign currency. Thus, this range should equate to constant currency performance of around $3.27 to $3.29, which is at the middle of our original outlook of $3.24 to $3.32. And this effectively takes up the bottom of our expected range. 
So as we look forward, we expect to continue our top line momentum, further invest in the business, deliver double-digit EPS growth in Q4 and aggressively reduce inventory levels. As part of this, as Ed mentioned, we now expect our full year tax rate to be in the mid to low 20s. And finally, we expect to deliver $1 billion in operating free cash flow on a reported basis after the impact of spending for special items. 
So to summarize, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment; driving the top line primarily through growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and an increase in marketing behind our Top 15 brands; continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment; successfully executing our productivity initiatives to further build the foundation for the future; and expecting to deliver our original full year outlook. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Meg, and we'll take your questions. Meg?"

For the quarter, ROI was up nicely, and we continue to drive the productivity initiatives. So we're feeling very good about the business. I think what you're seeing is some timing in terms of the tax impact. Certainly, the tax was better than we expected this quarter, probably a little bit worse than we expected next quarter, so largely timing there. This allows us flexibility, frankly. I mean, in this tough environment, there is just no reason to be heroic. So I think we are prudently balancing the P&L. We're also aggressively taking out inventory in the fourth quarter. And as you know, as you reduce inventory, you take an absorption hit. You're pulling basically fixed costs off the balance sheet into the P&L and there's a hit associated with that, but we think that's the right thing to do, to pull inventory out and to drive cash flow.

At this point, I'm probably not going to say a lot about '13, but let me just give you a flavor for how we're thinking about Europe and what's going on there. Reality is, about half of our business in Europe is in the U.K. That business has been going extremely well for us. We're very, very pleased with the execution and the strategy that the guys there have from a marketing and a sales standpoint. So very good performance there. U.K. soup in the quarter was up dramatically. We're coming out with great innovations, things like Squeeze & Stir, the Talking Labels. We've got a lot of PR going on, so there's lots of good things going on there. And I just think we are executing extremely well in a tough market. There's no doubt about it. But I think we are advantaged by the fact that the bulk of our business or certainly roughly half of our business is in the U.K. But even beyond the U.K., if you look at what else is working there, Ketchup in Europe, across Europe, is doing extremely well. Rolling airboats [ph] has been driving that for us globally and certainly across Europe. And we've talked to you about the performance there in the past, and that performance continues to do extremely well and, in fact, accelerate. So Ketchup across Europe is doing well. If you think about Russia, that's a real growth engine for us. Organic sales up around 19%, as I recall, in the quarter. So that's a combination of sauces and also baby food. So we feel very good about that. I mean, to your point about Southern Europe, yes, it's a tough environment, no doubt about it. Italy is a tough place to be doing business. We had a truck strike at the end of the third quarter that certainly impeded sales somewhat in Q3. But here again, we're innovating. We're bringing new products out there. We've just got Aseptic, which is a much higher quality baby food product that has come out in Italy and that's in the U.K. as well. And as we look forward, we're investing in the supply chain hub there, which should bring great manufacturing efficiencies. We're putting in the Heinz Innovation Center, which should amp up our ability to innovate across Europe. And finally, Keystone continues to roll out. So net-net, yes, Europe is a tough environment, but I think we're doing all the right things."

The result was a bit of a value gap there. And frankly, we could get that share back tomorrow, but what we're trying to do is balance really volume, price share and margin. I would say elasticity in that category is probably higher than we'd originally anticipated. And I think if Bill were here, he would use his old maximum of fix the problem and market the fix. So we're addressing it with -- addressing the value gap on our 2-pound bag. We're also, as you know, launching a 1-pound bag at $1.99. We have high hopes for what that will do for us.

Within the U.S., some people are shifting to more cheaper meals out, and you're seeing the benefit of that in some of the QSRs, particularly McDonald's and SUBWAY. But at the end of the day, we're not going to chase share. We could easily buy volume in this kind of market. But I think we're going to continue to try to do the right things, recognize the environment for what it is. I think value means different things to different people, and I believe Bill will expand upon that at CAGNY next week. For some people, volume means lower cost per ounce. For others that are really struggling, it is that entry level price point. And so that's what we're trying to address. And at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder, we're going to be innovating to meet those needs. It used to be a little simpler in that you could address just the relatively more affluent.

They're building their capacity. They're going one province at a time. And you're seeing some big numbers coming out of there, and we fully expect that to continue. In terms of Brazil, that is tracking right on plan. As I mentioned, we got Ketchup in there now going through the Quero sales force, big growth coming out of there now. It's off a small base, but we're very excited about that and, frankly, just excited about all the categories in Brazil and our ability to take their products through the modern trade or upgrading their manufacturing capability, et cetera, et cetera. So I think, frankly, I think that from a bottom line standpoint, I won't quote you specific numbers because I don't have them off the top of my head, but I think just moderately positive this year.

The growth in these segments was really terrific. How sustainable are these types of rates of growth? And can you talk about capacity constraints? Because I know in both the Foodstar acquisition and in the Quero acquisition, capacity issues were very key in your initial assessment of what those businesses would contribute to Heinz. So can you talk about both the growth rates going forward and then the capacity side?"

To be quite honest, you just have to look at the dynamics in these Emerging Markets where the rising middle class, more discretionary income, fragmented trade environment, fragmented competitive set, I mean, all dynamics in those markets are very positive. And so we see for a long period of time very strong growth in those kinds -- those markets. And you're seeing -- if you look over the past, and we've been at that double digit kind of rate. And we sure expect that kind of number to continue over the long haul. Because it's -- this is not a short-term phenomena. If you look at just some of the demographics over the next 10 to 20 years, you will see dramatic growth in those markets that will help consumer product kind of companies. So we're very, very attuned to that. The strategy is all built for it."

Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which marks a great start to fiscal 2013. In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again driven by our trio of growth engines:",1238,"Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which marks a great start to fiscal 2013. 
In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again driven by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands. Year-over-year gross margin improvement for the first time in 5 quarters despite the tough economic environment and higher commodity costs. Continued investment in the business including marketing, Project Keystone and more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets and strong constant currency profit growth driven by higher operating income and a lower tax rate. On a reported basis, results were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. So overall, we're off to a very good start for the new year. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales grew by more than 4%, operating income increased 5% and EPS rose more than 15% on a like-for-like basis which excludes the impact of last year's charges for productivity initiatives. In short, strong results in a very challenging environment. 
Importantly, Q1 marked our 29th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth at nearly 5%. I think this is an important indicator of our focus on growth, the strength of our portfolio, the effectiveness of our commercial programs and consistency of performance. Our trio of growth engines, Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands, once again drove our organic sales growth. I want to briefly get some highlights in each of these areas. 
Our Emerging Markets posted organic sales growth of almost 20%. The growth was led by Carolyn Brazil, Foodstar in China and Heinz in Russia. Importantly, in Russia, Heinz is now the #1 brand in both ketchup and total condiments. We also had strong organic sales growth in Indonesia and India. Overall, Emerging Markets represented a record 26% of Heinz sales in Q1, which is our high watermark in the year for emerging market mix given the timing of Ramadan. 
Of note this quarter in Brazil, it has been the business processes and the implementation of SAP allowed us to eliminate the 1 month lag in closing the books there, so our results include an extra month in Brazil, which was partially offset by the planned sales reduction in Long Fong related to the significant streamlining we executed in that business last quarter. 
And turning to Global Ketchup, we posted a 3.7% organic growth overlapping more than 8% organic growth last year. Our Emerging Markets are Brazil, Russia and China, delivered strong double-digit growth, driven by both retail and Foodservice channels. U.K. led our developed markets in ketchup growth aided by innovative line extensions like ketchup with balsamic vinegar and now Indian spices. 
Turning to our Top 15 brands, we posted nearly 6% organic sales growth in Q1. As a result, these core brands have grown to nearly 3 quarters of our portfolio. It's an important advantage for us and it allows us to more tightly and effectively focus our commercial resources and investment dollars. 
Now let's take a quick look at each of our geographic regions. Turning first to North American Consumer Products, our results reflected solid and encouraging performance in the U.S. Excluding the 2 product lines we exited last year, Boston market, which is included in divestitures, T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals, organic sales in our core U.S. business were up more than 3%. The solid growth is reflective of stronger market shares and indeed we grew volume share in 9 of our 12 U.S. retail product categories over the last 12-week period while increasing our average net price. 
I'm pleased to report good progress on Ore-Ida as well, where sales increased as a mid-single digit rate during the quarter. We've been working with our current partners to optimize Ore-Ida pricing on the shelves which is just beginning to have a positive effect. We also posted mid- ingle-digit sales growth in Smart Ones and a 2% volume increase in ketchup. 
Operating income was off slightly the prior year impacted by higher commodity cost, sales mix and increased investment in marketing. And finally, we went live on SAP in Canada during the quarter and incurred some startup challenges there. 
U.S. Foodservice delivered excellent results for the quarter. Organic sales grew about 2.5%, driven by price increases implemented last year to cover inflation. Encouragingly, volume was stable and the trajectory's been improving, driven by more favorable QSR trends and our success in penetrating noncommercial channels. Operating income grew at a double-digit rate reflecting higher pricing and lower costs, literally aided by the benefits from last year's restructuring initiatives. 
As Ed will discuss shortly, we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice desserts business this quarter and we continue to enhance our focus on branded ketchup and sauces. 
Turning next to Europe, the segment generated very solid constant currency results for the quarter with sales up 1.5 points and profit up almost 8%. Organic sales growth was 2% driven by pricing. The U.K. and Russia continue to drive very strong growth, particularly on ketchup, while sales in Continental Europe and Italy continue to be impacted by weak economies and categories. During the quarter, we increased marketing and continued to drive the European change agenda in order to meet the evolving environment there. Additionally, we have successfully implemented Keystone in Germany while also divesting a small unprofitable soup business in Germany and consolidating back-office activities into the Netherlands. 
Moving to Asia/Pacific, constant currency sales grew by more than 4%, led by Indonesia, India and China and by soy sauce from a category standpoint. This growth includes a negative impact on streamlining Long Fong, which cut the size of that business in 1/2 as we executed or exited 2 or 4 factories and focused on higher growth, higher-margin products. The region posted 30% profit growth, reflecting improved net pricing, productivity, sales mix and a strong rebound in Australia, which was aided by last year's restructuring initiatives. Additionally, we'll continue to increase investments in marketing, and in sales capabilities across Emerging Markets in the region. 
The Rest of World segment reported 32% constant currency sales growth for the quarter, driven by very strong year-over-year growth in Brazil, plus the extra month, as well as double-digit growth in Mexico and the Middle East. Venezuelan sales were down for the quarter as a result of the macroeconomic issues in the country. Rest of World delivered 3% constant currency profit growth, lapping more than 100% growth last year, with Brazil's strong performance being partially offset by weakness in Venezuela. As mentioned, several recent actions we've taken to continue streamlining, reshaping and strengthening our portfolio. These included completing the sale of our U.S. Foodservice desserts, business which we announced at Analyst Day in May, exiting subscale frozen businesses in U.S. retail by divesting the Boston market license and discontinuing T.G.I. Friday's premium frozen meals, divesting a small unprofitable soup business in Germany and rightsizing our Long Fong frozen business in China. Now these and many other actions we've executed over the last decade has helped focus the portfolio on those brands and categories where we have the capabilities and position to win. Ketchup and sauces are the crown jewel which now represent almost 1/2 of our sales. This is an important shift in the portfolio which we're continuing to drive aggressively. 
Now with that said, I'll turn it over to Ed to cover the rest of the financials. Ed?"
278212,215602907,351210,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 29, 2012",2012-08-29,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through their first quarter financial highlights to reflect strong constant currency growth in our key P&L metrics. But before I go through the results, as Art referenced earlier, in May, we completed",965,"Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through their first quarter financial highlights to reflect strong constant currency growth in our key P&L metrics. But before I go through the results, as Art referenced earlier, in May, we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice frozen desserts business, that resulted in a $0.07 charge to EPS, so long with last year's results are reflected in discontinued operations. Now let's walk through the financials. 
Here, you can see 3 different views of EPS. At any way to look at it, we delivered double-digit growth. Starting on the left, our results from continuing operations, which exclude the productivity charges last year, reflect 10% growth at $0.87 this year. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have been $0.91, up 15% increase from the comparable base last year. And finally, from the total company reported basis, EPS was $0.80 this year, up 14%. The balance of the presentation will focus on the company's results from continuing operations compared to last year's results, excluding productivity charges. And as a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '12, the productivity charges were $41 million pretax or $0.09 of EPS. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard, constant currency sales were up over 4%, but down 1.5% after a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Gross margin was 35.9%, up slightly as higher pricing and productivity improvements were able to more than offset commodity inflation. Looking forward, as we progress through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to continue to outpace commodity cost increases and margins will build significantly throughout the year. 
We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing which was up 4.5% on a constant currency basis with the incremental spending split evenly between developed and emerging markets. For perspective, we expect a sizable ramp-up of marketing in Q2 and throughout the year. Operating income is up 5% on a constant currency basis as higher organize sales growth and effective cost management offset unfavorable commodities while also supporting increased marketing and incremental investments in both Project Keystone and emerging market capabilities. After the impact of currency, OI was about flat. EPS of $0.87 benefited from effective tax rate of approximately 18% this year compared to 24% last year. In Q1, and to a greater extent in Q2, we expect the benefit from foreign tax planning initiatives with a full year estimate for the tax rate remains in the low 20s with higher-than-average rates in the second half of the year. 
Looking at the Q sales drivers, our organic sales growth of 4 .8% was fairly balance between volume and price. Volume improved 2.5%, driven by Emerging Markets, led by a very strong performance in Brazil, as well as improvements in the U.S. and the U.K. The Brazilian results reflect exceptional normalized organic growth of 45% as further aided by an additional month's results. The majority of the benefit from the additional month was offset by the planned exits of T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals in the U.S. and the streamlining of the Long Fong business in China to focus on only more profitable products and regions. Higher pricing at 2.3% was driven by price increases in most of the Emerging Markets, particularly Latin America and China, as well as in the developed markets of the U.S. and U.K. The divestitures of the Boston market brand in the U.S. and a small soup business in Germany decreased sales by 60 basis points. And finally, foreign exchange reduced our top line by 5.6%. 
Looking at sales by category, Ketchup and Sauces, our most important category, led the way with nearly 6% organic growth. Meals & Snacks reported overall organic growth of 3.1%, and notably, both the ambient and frozen segments were positive as contributions from both volume and price in each. Infant/Nutrition recorded 2.3% organic growth, driven by a 12% increase in Emerging Markets. 
Art cover each of the segments performance in detail, but here you can quickly see all of our segments delivered positive organic growth this quarter. 
As I noted earlier, our gross margin was up slightly from last year with a 10 basis point improvement to 35.9%. The market basket for our commodities was up almost 4%, primarily due to sweeteners, most notably in Indonesia, and beans in Europe, as well as glass globally. So the contributions from pricing and productivity more than offset this inflation. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 3% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year and we're still anticipating spending of approximately 4% of sales for the full fiscal year as we support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as the continued rollout of Project Keystone. Cash conversion cycle delivered a substantial improvement of 6 days driven by receivables and inventory and represents a record low CCC of 36 days, around 1/3 of where we were a decade ago. In line with our expectations, operating free cash flow was an outflow of $25 million. This reflects $42 million of cash paid this quarter for fiscal 2012 productivity initiatives. While last year, QOWC benefit from the timing of drawdowns on our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our debt to EBITDA at 2.1x was up slightly the prior year, driven by modestly higher net debt, and I'm pleased to point out that Fitch recently raised our debt rating to BBB+. ROIC was nearly 20% for the quarter, up 110 basis points from this time last year, driven by our 10% increase in net income this quarter. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results in Q1, delivering almost 5% organic sales growth, constant currency operating income growth in excess of 5% and double-digit EPS growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook."

With Q1 behind us, let's take a look at what we expect for the balance of the fiscal year. Beginning with Q2, we expect another quarter of organic sales growth at around 4%; improving gross margin based on the combination of net pricing and productivity more than offsetting commodity inflation; implementation of our planned incremental investments and marketing, Project Keystone and sales capabilities in Emerging Markets to drive top line growth and further strengthen our foundation for the future; marketing spending in particular will increase significantly in Q2 behind a number of new initiatives in the U.S., U.K. and emerging market; the Q2 tax rate will be very favorable at a low double-digit rates based on the flow of our foreign tax planning initiatives. And note that while our tax rate will be quite favorable through the first half of the year, we still anticipate that our full year tax rate will be in the low 20s. And foreign currency will continue to be unfavorable. Overall, we expect constant currency EPS growth of around 10% in Q2. 
Importantly, for the full year, we are reaffirming our FY '13 constant currency targets. This reflects the strong start we made in the first quarter and our confidence in our brands, our people, our plans and our ability to respond to ever-changing market conditions around the world. 
So to sum up, our fiscal year is off to a strong start. Our key growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, continue to provide strong and consistent growth. The savings from last year's productivity initiatives are coming in according to our expectations. We expect sequential improvement in our year-over-year gross margin results. And finally, we are on track to execute the $120 million of planned investments we discussed in May to help drive the business for sustainable long-term growth.

So all of those things work to our benefit. The other thing we're seeing is over time, we're seeing the gross margins improving in our newer businesses with Quero in Brazil and Foodstar in China. As usual, when you buy these businesses, the gross margins tend to start out relatively low, but the opportunity to drive those northward, we're certainly seeing that.

On the flip side of that, we have driven, I think, very effectively against making our promotion spending more efficient and more effective in many cases both for us and for our joint customers. So I think Dave Moran's been doing a nice job with his team over in Europe on that. Dave Woodward certainly is focused on that arena. We're focused on it in Australia as well. So I'd say it's a difficult environment, but we're -- I think, we've got the tools and the knowledge to be more nuanced and more effective at it than maybe we would've been in the past.

Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which marks a great start to fiscal 2013. In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again, driven by our trio of growth engines:",1239,"Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which marks a great start to fiscal 2013. 
In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again, driven by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands. Year-over-year gross margin improvement for the first time in 5 quarters despite the tough economic environment and higher commodity costs. Continued investment in the business including marketing, Project Keystone and more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets and strong constant currency profit growth driven by higher operating income and lower tax rate. On a reported basis, results were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. So overall, we're off to a very good start for the new year. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales grew by more than 4%, operating income increased 5% and EPS rose more than 15% on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of last year's charges for productivity initiatives. In short, strong results in a very challenging environment. 
Importantly, Q1 marked our 29th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth at nearly 5%. I think this is an important indicator of our focus on growth, the strength of our portfolio, the effectiveness of our commercial programs and consistency of performance. Our trio of growth engines, Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands, once again drove our organic sales growth. I want to briefly hit some highlights in each of these areas. 
Our Emerging Markets posted organic sales growth of almost 20%. The growth was led by Quero in Brazil, Foodstar in China and Heinz in Russia. Importantly, in Russia, Heinz is now the #1 brand in both ketchup and total condiments. We also had strong organic sales growth in Indonesia and India. Overall, Emerging Markets represented a record 26% of Heinz sales in Q1, which is our high watermark in the year for Emerging Market mix given the timing of Ramadan. 
Of note this quarter in Brazil, enhancement of business processes and the implementation of SAP allowed us to eliminate the 1 month lag in closing the books there, so our results include an extra month in Brazil which was partially offset by the planned sales reduction in Long Fong related to the significant streamlining we executed in that business last quarter. 
And turning to Global Ketchup, we posted a 3.7% organic growth overlapping more than 8% organic growth last year. Our Emerging Markets at Brazil, Russia and China delivered strong double-digit growth, driven by both the retail and Foodservice channels. U.K. led our developed markets in ketchup growth, aided by innovative line extensions like ketchup with balsamic vinegar and now Indian spices. 
Turning to our Top 15 brands, we posted nearly 6% organic sales growth in Q1. As a result, these core brands have grown to nearly 3/4 of our total portfolio. It's an important advantage for us and it allows us to more tightly and effectively focus our commercial resources and investment dollars. 
Now let's take a quick look at each of our geographic regions. Turning first to North American Consumer Products, our results reflected solid and encouraging performance in the U.S. Excluding the 2 product lines we exited last year, Boston Market, which is included in divestitures, and T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals, organic sales in our core U.S. business were up more than 3%. The solid growth is reflective of stronger market shares and indeed we grew volume share in 9 of our 12 U.S. retail product categories over the last 12-week period while increasing our average net price. 
I'm pleased to report good progress on Ore-Ida as well, where sales increased as a mid-single digit rate during the quarter. We've been working with our trade partners to optimize Ore-Ida pricing on the shelf, and this is beginning to have a positive effect. We also posted mid single-digit sales growth in Smart Ones and a 2% volume increase in Ketchup. 
Operating income was off slightly the prior year, impacted by higher commodity cost, sales mix and increased investment in marketing. And finally, we went live on SAP in Canada during the quarter and incurred some start-up challenges there. 
U.S. Foodservice delivered excellent results for the quarter. Organic sales grew about 2.5%, driven by price increases implemented last year to cover inflation. Encouragingly, volume was stable and the trajectory has been improving, driven by more favorable QSR trends and our success in penetrating noncommercial channels. Operating income grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting higher pricing and lower costs, literally aided by the benefits from last year's restructuring initiatives. 
And as Ed will discuss shortly, we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice Desserts business this quarter where we continue to enhance our focus on branded Ketchup & Sauces. 
Turning next to Europe, the segment generated very solid constant currency results for the quarter with sales up 1.5 points and profit up almost 8%. Organic sales growth was 2% driven by pricing. U.K. and Russia continue to drive very strong growth, particularly on ketchup, while sales in Continental Europe and Italy continue to be impacted by weak economies and categories. During the quarter, we increased marketing and continued to drive the European change agenda in order to meet the evolving environment there. 
Additionally, we successfully implemented Keystone in Germany while also divesting a small unprofitable soup business in Germany and consolidating back-office activities into the Netherlands. 
Moving to Asia/Pacific, constant currency sales grew by more than 4%, led by Indonesia, India and China and by soy sauce from a category standpoint. This growth includes the negative impact of streamlining Long Fong, which cut the size of that business in half as we executed -- or exited 2 of 4 factories and focused on higher-growth, higher-margin products. The region posted 30% profit growth, reflecting improved net pricing, productivity, sales mix and a strong rebound in Australia, which was aided by last year's restructuring initiatives. Additionally, we'll continue to increase investments in marketing and in sales capabilities across Emerging Markets in the region. 
The Rest of World segment reported 32% constant currency sales growth for the quarter driven by very strong year-over-year growth in Brazil, plus the extra month, as well as double-digit growth in Mexico and the Middle East. Venezuelan sales were down for the quarter as a result of the macroeconomic issues in the country. Rest of World delivered 3% constant currency profit growth, lapping more than 100% growth last year, with Brazil's strong performance being partially offset by weakness in Venezuela. I would mention several recent actions we've taken to continue streamlining, reshaping and strengthening our portfolio. These included: completing the sale of our U.S. Foodservice Desserts business, which we announced at Analyst Day in May; exiting subscale frozen businesses in U.S. retail by divesting the Boston Market license and discontinuing T.G.I. Friday's premium frozen meals; divesting a small, unprofitable soup business in Germany; and rightsizing our Long Fong frozen business in China. Now these and many other actions we've executed over the last decade has helped focus the portfolio on those brands and categories where we have the capabilities and position to win. Ketchup & Sauces are the crown jewel, which now represent almost half of our sales. This is an important shift in the portfolio, which we're continuing to drive aggressively. 
Now with that said, I'll turn it over to Ed to cover the rest of the financials. Ed?"

Starting on the left, our results from continuing operations, which exclude the productivity charges last year, reflect 10% growth at $0.87 this year. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have been $0.91, up 15% increase from the comparable base last year. And finally, from a total company reported basis, EPS was $0.80 this year, up 14%. The balance of the presentation will focus on the company's results from continuing operations compared to last year's results excluding productivity charges. And as a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '12, the productivity charges were $41 million pretax or $0.09 of EPS. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard, constant currency sales were up over 4% but down 1.5% after a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Gross margin was 35.9%, up slightly as higher pricing and productivity improvements were able to more than offset commodity inflation. Looking forward, as we progress through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to continue to outpace commodity cost increases and margins will build significantly throughout the year. 
We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing, which was up 4.5% on a constant currency basis with the incremental spending split evenly between developed and emerging markets. For perspective, we expect a sizable ramp-up of marketing in Q2 and throughout the year. Operating income is up 5% on a constant currency basis as higher organic sales growth and effective cost management offset unfavorable commodities while also supporting increased marketing and incremental investments in both Project Keystone and Emerging Market capabilities. After the impact of currency, OI was about flat. 
EPS of $0.87 benefited from effective tax rate of approximately 18% this year compared to 24% last year. In Q1, and to a greater extent in Q2, we expect the benefit from foreign tax planning initiatives as our full year estimate for the tax rate remains in the low 20s with higher-than-average rates in the second half of the year. 
Looking at the key sales drivers. Our organic sales growth of 4 .8% was fairly balanced between volume and price. Volume improved 2.5%, driven by Emerging Markets, led by a very strong performance in Brazil, as well as improvements in the U.S. and the U.K. The Brazilian results reflect exceptional normalized organic growth of 45%. It was further aided by an additional month's results. The majority of the benefit from the additional month was offset by the planned exits of T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals in the U.S. and the streamlining of the Long Fong business in China to focus on only more profitable products and regions. Higher pricing at 2.3% was driven by price increases in most of the Emerging Markets, particularly Latin America and China, as well as in the developed markets of the U.S. and U.K. The divestitures of the Boston Market brand in the U.S. and a small soup business in Germany decreased sales by 60 basis points. And finally, foreign exchange reduced our top line by 5.6%. 
Looking at sales by category, Ketchup & Sauces, our most important category, led the way with nearly 6% organic growth. Meals & Snacks reported overall organic growth of 3.1%, and notably, both the ambient and frozen segments were positive with contributions from both volume and price in each. Infant/Nutrition recorded 2.3% organic growth, driven by a 12% increase in Emerging Markets. 
Art covered each of the segments' performance in detail, but here you can quickly see all of our segments delivered positive organic growth this quarter. 
As I noted earlier, our gross margin was up slightly from last year with a 10 basis point improvement to 35.9%. The market basket for our commodities was up almost 4%, primarily due to sweeteners, most notably in Indonesia, tomatoes and beans in Europe, as well as glass globally. Solid contributions from pricing and productivity more than offset this inflation. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 3% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year and we're still anticipating spending of approximately 4% of sales for the full fiscal year as we support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as the continued rollout of Project Keystone. Cash conversion cycle delivered a substantial improvement of 6 days driven by receivables and inventory and represents a record low CCC of 36 days, around 1/3 of where we were a decade ago. In line with our expectations, operating free cash flow was an outflow of $25 million. This reflects $42 million of cash paid this quarter for fiscal 2012 productivity initiatives. While last year, QOWC benefit from the timing of drawdowns on our accounts receivable securitization programs. Net debt to EBITDA at 2.1x was up slightly the prior year, driven by modestly higher net debt. And I'm pleased to point out that Fitch recently raised our debt rating to BBB+. ROIC was nearly 20% for the quarter, up 110 basis points from this time last year, driven by our 10% increase in net income this quarter. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results in Q1, delivering almost 5% organic sales growth, constant currency operating income growth in excess of 5% and double-digit EPS growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook."

With Q1 behind us, let's take a look at what we expect for the balance of the fiscal year. Beginning with Q2, we expect another quarter of organic sales growth at around 4%; improving gross margin based on the combination of net pricing and productivity more than offsetting commodity inflation; implementation of our planned incremental investments and marketing, Project Keystone and sales capabilities in Emerging Markets to drive top line growth and further strengthen our foundation for the future; marketing spending in particular will increase significantly in Q2 behind a number of new initiatives in the U.S., U.K. and emerging markets; the Q2 tax rate will be very favorable at a low double-digit rate based on the flow of our foreign tax planning initiatives. And note that while our tax rate will be quite favorable through the first half of the year, we still anticipate that our full year tax rate will be in the low 20s. And foreign currency will continue to be unfavorable. Overall, we expect constant currency EPS growth of around 10% in Q2. 
Importantly, for the full year, we are reaffirming our FY '13 constant currency targets. This reflects the strong start we made in the first quarter and our confidence in our brands, our people, our plans and our ability to respond to ever-changing market conditions around the world. 
So to sum up, our fiscal year is off to a strong start. Our key growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, continue to provide strong and consistent growth. The savings from last year's productivity initiatives are coming in according to our expectations. We expect sequential improvement in our year-over-year gross margin results. And finally, we are on track to execute the $120 million of planned investments we discussed in May to help drive the business for sustainable long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Meg and then I'll -- we'll open it up to your questions. Meg?"

The other thing I might add is that we're beginning to leverage the scale and efficiencies of our consolidated European supply chain hub, so we feel good about where we're going there. We've had our new global head of procurement, John Dickson, joined not too long ago and I think he's starting to make some traction.

And then I guess the second question is just a bit broader is you pre-released yesterday, EPS constant currency is up a little over 15%. You're saying, I guess, for Q2 that you expecting a low double-digit tax rate, but then for the full year, you expect similar to what you guided to at the Investor Day. So that should be in line going up in the back half. It sounds like there's a little bit more investment coming in Q2 and really in the back half. So if you're not increasing guidance on constant currency from $0.05 to $0.08 even though you did 15% in Q1 and then Q2 would seem like you would have to be a little bit higher than guidance, too, just because of the tax rate again, is it -- is what -- are you just playing it safe in Q1 because it's early in the fiscal year? Or is what we should be expecting and modeling is basically a deceleration of EPS growth into the back half of the fiscal year really because the tax rate rolls off?"

Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which marks a great start to fiscal 2013. In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again, driven by our trio of growth engines:",1241,"Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which marks a great start to fiscal 2013. 
In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again, driven by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands; year-over-year gross margin improvement for the first time in 5 quarters despite the tough economic environment and higher commodity costs; continued investment in the business including marketing, Project Keystone and more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets and strong constant currency profit growth driven by higher operating income and a lower tax rate. On a reported basis, results were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange. So overall, we're off to a very good start for the new year. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales grew by more than 4%, operating income increased 5% and EPS rose more than 15% on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of last year's charges for productivity initiatives. In short, strong results in a very challenging environment. 
Importantly, Q1 marked our 29th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth at nearly 5%. I think this is an important indicator of our focus on growth, the strength of our portfolio, the effectiveness of our commercial programs and consistency of performance. Our trio of growth engines, Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 brands, once again drove our organic sales growth. I want to briefly hit some highlights in each of these areas. 
Our Emerging Markets posted organic sales growth of almost 20%. The growth was led by Quero in Brazil, Foodstar in China and Heinz in Russia. Importantly, in Russia, Heinz is now the #1 brand in both ketchup and total condiments. We also had strong organic sales growth in Indonesia and India. Overall, Emerging Markets represented a record 26% of Heinz sales in Q1, which is our high watermark in the year for Emerging Market mix given the timing of Ramadan. 
Of note this quarter in Brazil, enhancement of business processes and the implementation of SAP allowed us to eliminate the 1 month lag in closing the books there, so our results include an extra month in Brazil which was partially offset by the planned sales reduction in Long Fong related to the significant streamlining we executed in that business last quarter. 
And turning to Global Ketchup, we posted 3.7% organic growth, overlapping more than 8% organic growth last year. Our Emerging Markets of Brazil, Russia and China delivered strong double-digit growth, driven by both the retail and Foodservice channels. U.K. led our developed markets in ketchup growth, aided by innovative line extensions like ketchup with balsamic vinegar and now Indian spices. 
Turning to our Top 15 brands, we posted nearly 6% organic sales growth in Q1. As a result, these core brands have grown to nearly 3/4 of our total portfolio. That's an important advantage for us in that it allows us to more tightly and effectively focus our commercial resources and investment dollars. 
Now let's take a quick look at each of our geographic regions. Turning first to North American Consumer Products, our results reflected solid and encouraging performance in the U.S. Excluding the 2 product lines we exited last year, Boston Market, which is included in divestitures, and T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals, organic sales in our core U.S. business were up more than 3%. The solid growth is reflective of stronger market shares, and indeed we grew volume share in 9 of our 12 U.S. retail product categories over the last 12-week period while increasing our average net price. 
I'm pleased to report good progress on Ore-Ida as well, where sales increased as a mid-single digit rate during the quarter. We've been working with our trade partners to optimize Ore-Ida pricing on the shelf, and this is beginning to have a positive effect. We also posted mid single-digit sales growth in Smart Ones and a 2% volume increase in Ketchup. 
Operating income was off slightly to prior year, impacted by higher commodity cost, sales mix and an increased investment in marketing. And finally, we went live on SAP in Canada during the quarter and incurred some start-up challenges there. 
U.S. Foodservice delivered excellent results for the quarter. Organic sales grew about 2.5%, driven by price increases implemented last year to cover inflation. Encouragingly, volume was stable and the trajectory has been improving, driven by more favorable QSR trends and our success in penetrating noncommercial channels. Operating income grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting higher pricing and lower costs, clearly aided by the benefits from last year's restructuring initiatives. 
And as Ed will discuss shortly, we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice Desserts business this quarter as we continue to enhance our focus on branded Ketchup & Sauces. 
Turning next to Europe. The segment generated very solid constant currency results for the quarter with sales up 1.5 points and profit up almost 8%. Organic sales growth was 2%, driven by pricing. U.K. and Russia continue to drive very strong growth, particularly on ketchup, while sales in Continental Europe and Italy continue to be impacted by weak economies and categories. During the quarter, we increased marketing and continued to drive the European change agenda in order to meet the evolving environment there. 
Additionally, we successfully implemented Keystone in Germany while also divesting a small unprofitable soup business in Germany and consolidating back-office activities into the Netherlands. 
Moving to Asia/Pacific. Constant currency sales grew by more than 4%, led by Indonesia, India and China and by soy sauce from a category standpoint. This growth includes the negative impact of streamlining Long Fong, which cut the size of that business in half as we executed -- or exited 2 of 4 factories and focused on higher-growth, higher-margin products. The region posted 30% profit growth, reflecting improved net pricing, productivity, sales mix and a strong rebound in Australia, which was aided by last year's restructuring initiatives. Additionally, we continued to increase investments in marketing and in sales capabilities across Emerging Markets in the region. 
The Rest of World segment reported 32% constant currency sales growth for the quarter driven by very strong year-over-year growth in Brazil, plus the extra month, as well as double-digit growth in Mexico and the Middle East. Venezuelan sales were down for the quarter as a result of the macroeconomic issues in the country. Rest of World delivered 3% constant currency profit growth, lapping more than 100% growth last year, with Brazil's strong performance being partially offset by weakness in Venezuela. And I've mentioned several recent actions we've taken to continue streamlining, reshaping and strengthening our portfolio. These included: completing the sale of our U.S. Foodservice Desserts business, which we announced at Analyst Day in May; exiting subscale frozen businesses in U.S. retail by divesting the Boston Market license and discontinuing T.G.I. Friday's premium frozen meals; divesting a small, unprofitable soup business in Germany; and rightsizing our Long Fong frozen business in China. Now these and many other actions we've executed over the last decade has helped focus the portfolio on those brands and categories where we have the capabilities and position to win. Ketchup & Sauces are the crown jewel, which now represent almost half of our sales. This is an important shift in the portfolio, which we're continuing to drive aggressively. 
Now with that said, I'll turn it over to Ed to cover the rest of the financials. Ed?"

I'll take you through the first quarter financial highlights, which reflect strong constant currency growth in our key P&L metrics. But before I go through the results, as Art referenced earlier, in May we complete",965,"Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the first quarter financial highlights, which reflect strong constant currency growth in our key P&L metrics. But before I go through the results, as Art referenced earlier, in May we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice frozen desserts business. It resulted in a $0.07 charge to EPS, which along with last year's results are reflected in discontinued operations. 
Now let's walk through the financials. Here, you can see 3 different views of EPS. But any way you look at it, we delivered double-digit growth. Starting on the left, our results from continuing operations, which exclude the productivity charges last year, reflect 10% growth to $0.87 this year. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have been $0.91, a 15% increase from the comparable base last year. And finally, on a total company reported basis, EPS was $0.80 this year, up 14%. The balance of the presentation will focus on the company's results from continuing operations compared to last year's results excluding productivity charges. And as a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '12, the productivity charges were $41 million pretax or $0.09 of EPS. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard, constant currency sales were up over 4% but down 1.5% after a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Gross margin was 35.9%, up slightly as higher pricing and productivity improvements were able to more than offset commodity inflation. Looking forward, as we progress through the year, we expect pricing and productivity to continue to outpace commodity cost increases, and margins will build significantly throughout the year. 
We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing, which was up 4.5% on a constant currency basis with the incremental spending split evenly between developed and emerging markets. For perspective, we expect a sizable ramp-up of marketing in Q2 and throughout the year. Operating income is up 5% on a constant currency basis as higher organic sales growth and effective cost management offset unfavorable commodities while also supporting increased marketing and incremental investments in both Project Keystone and Emerging Market capabilities. After the impact of currency, OI was about flat. 
EPS of $0.87 benefited from the effective tax rate of approximately 18% this year compared to 24% last year. In Q1, and to a greater extent in Q2, the expected benefit from foreign tax planning initiatives and our full year estimate for the tax rate remains in the low 20s with higher-than-average rates in the second half of the year. 
Looking at the key sales drivers. Our organic sales growth of 4.8% was fairly balanced between volume and price. Volume improved 2.5%, driven by Emerging Markets, led by a very strong performance in Brazil, as well as improvements in the U.S. and the U.K. The Brazilian results reflect exceptional normalized organic growth of 45%. It was further aided by an additional month's results. The majority of the benefit from the additional month was offset by the planned exits of T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals in the U.S. and the streamlining of the Long Fong business in China to focus on only more profitable products and regions. Higher pricing at 2.3% was driven by price increases in most of the Emerging Markets, particularly Latin America and China, as well as in the developed markets of the U.S. and U.K. The divestitures of the Boston Market brand in the U.S. and a small soup business in Germany decreased sales by 60 basis points. And finally, foreign exchange reduced our top line by 5.6%. 
Looking at sales by category. Ketchup & Sauces, our most important category, led the way with nearly 6% organic growth. Meals & Snacks reported overall organic growth of 3.1%, and notably, both the ambient and frozen segments were positive with contributions from both volume and price in each. Infant/Nutrition recorded 2.3% organic growth, driven by a 12% increase in Emerging Markets. 
Art covered each of the segments' performance in detail, but here you can quickly see all of our segments delivered positive organic growth this quarter. 
As I noted earlier, our gross margin was up slightly from last year with a 10 basis point improvement to 35.9%. The market basket for our commodities was up almost 4%, primarily due to sweeteners, most notably in Indonesia, tomatoes and beans in Europe, as well as glass globally. Solid contributions from pricing and productivity more than offset this inflation. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 3% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year, and we're still anticipating spending of approximately 4% of sales for the full fiscal year as we support growth in our Emerging Markets, as well as the continued rollout of Project Keystone. 
Cash conversion cycle delivered a substantial improvement of 6 days driven by receivables and inventory and represents a record low CCC of 36 days, around 1/3 of where we were a decade ago. 
In line with our expectations, operating free cash flow was an outflow of $25 million. This reflects $42 million of cash paid this quarter for fiscal 2012 productivity initiatives. While last year, QOWC benefit from the timing of drawdowns on our accounts receivable securitization programs. Net debt to EBITDA at 2.1x was up slightly to prior year, driven by modestly higher net debt. And I'm pleased to point out that Fitch recently raised our debt rating to BBB+. ROIC was nearly 20% for the quarter, up 110 basis points from this time last year, driven by our 10% increase in net income this quarter. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results in Q1, delivering almost 5% organic sales growth, constant currency operating income growth in excess of 5% and double-digit EPS growth. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full year outlook."

With Q1 behind us, let's take a look at what we expect for the balance of the fiscal year. Beginning with Q2, we expect another quarter of organic sales growth at around 4%; improving gross margin based on the combination of net pricing and productivity more than offsetting commodity inflation; implementation of our planned incremental investments and marketing, Project Keystone and sales capabilities in Emerging Markets to drive top line growth and further strengthen our foundation for the future. Marketing spending in particular will increase significantly in Q2 behind a number of new initiatives in the U.S., U.K. and emerging markets. The Q2 tax rate will be very favorable at a low double-digit rate based on the flow of our foreign tax planning initiatives. And note that while our tax rate will be quite favorable through the first half of the year, we still anticipate that our full year tax rate will be in the low 20s. And foreign currency will continue to be unfavorable. Overall, we expect constant currency EPS growth of around 10% in Q2. 
Importantly, for the full year, we are reaffirming our FY '13 constant currency targets. This reflects the strong start we made in the first quarter and our confidence in our brands, our people, our plans and our ability to respond to ever-changing market conditions around the world. 
So to sum up, our fiscal year is off to a strong start. Our key growth drivers, Emerging Markets, Top 15 brands and Global Ketchup, continue to provide strong and consistent growth. The savings from last year's productivity initiatives are coming in according to our expectations. We expect sequential improvement in our year-over-year gross margin results. And finally, we're on track to execute the $120 million of planned investments we discussed in May to help drive the business for sustainable long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Meg and then I'll -- we'll open it up to your questions. Meg?"

And we've got this heavy focus going on in terms of value engineering that combines with the restructuring programs and savings that we had from last year. So all of those things worked to our benefit. The other thing we're seeing, over time, we're seeing the gross margins improving in our newer businesses, in Quero in Brazil and Foodstar in China. As usual, when you buy these businesses, the gross margins tend to start out relatively low, but the opportunity is to drive those northward. We're certainly seeing that, and so we expect that to continue. The other thing I might add is that we're beginning to leverage the scale and efficiencies of our consolidated European supply chain hub, so we feel good about where we're going there.

This isn't -- it isn't a black-and-white thing and it varies by category and it varies by country. So it goes business-to-business, and we're trying to be very nuanced in our approach. So list pricing actions, in some cases, are not in the cards. On the flip side of that, we have driven, I think, very effectively against making our promotion spending more efficient and more effective, in many cases, both for us and for our trade customers. So I think Dave Moran has been doing a nice job with his team over in Europe on that. Dave Woodward certainly is focused in that arena. We're focused on it in Australia as well. So I'd say it's a difficult environment, but we're -- I think, we've got the tools and the knowledge to be more nuanced and more effective at it than maybe we would've been in the past. And then fundamentally, you probably got more pricing power in Emerging Markets just based on the fragmented trade environment and the more fragmented competitive set we see in those markets. So we believe we're on track to our plans for pricing, but it's certainly not an easy environment."

Capital spending was up a bit, and then there was some timing of receivable securitizations. But if you remember, we are a very back-half-oriented company. If you go back over the history of Heinz over the last 10 years, given the crop cycles in the Northern Hemisphere, we tend to be back-half-loaded in terms of cash flow.

So if you're not increasing guidance on constant currency from $0.05 to $0.08 even though you did 15% in Q1 and then Q2 would seem like you would have to be a little bit higher than guidance, too, just because of the tax rate again, is it -- is what -- are you just playing it safe in Q1 because it's early in the fiscal year?

It's like do you feel like this amount of reinvestment that you're doing now, we're not going to look back 3 years forward and say we have to streamline again?"

We will always try to be out front of those trends and those changes so that we're not getting dragged along behind trends. We're anticipating and we're getting out in front of them. We think those are the right things to do to continue to strengthen the portfolio. The investments are going behind our biggest brands, not some of these smaller brands. And I think one of the key statistics to keep an eye on or metrics is that percent of our total sales that are in those Top 15 brands, because those are the big powerhouse brands that I think have the leverage and the scale and the brand position to win. And so more and more, if we can focus the portfolio on those brands and then focus our resources, marketing and otherwise, on those, I think it's the right thing to do. But we're going to continue to evolve and adjust with the world that we're faced with."

And so I think Heinz is allocating its capital and its marketing dollars well, and the investment in systems is mandatory. It's something we have to do. As you know, we don't have a single ERP system where we can consolidate our global world, and that makes our world more difficult. And we've got to get that inefficiency out, so that spend is necessary. Regarding other investment spend, we evaluate. We're highly disciplined.

In terms of the marketing spend, on a constant currency basis, we've talked about at least $70 million. To the extent that currency moves in the other direction, it could moderate from there.

I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment.

I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. Starting with the second quarter, Heinz Liberty EPS of $0.90 from continuing operations with organic sales growth of between 3% and 4%, our 30th consecutive quarter of organic top line growth. These results reflect a nice balance between volume and pricing, and strengthen our 3 engines of growth: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Second quarter earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate that we leveraged to significantly increase investment in marketing and global capabilities to drive further growth. Importantly, we increased marketing spend by over 13% in the quarter on a constant currency basis with a particularly large increase in North America where I am encouraged by our recent momentum. We're also continuing to ramp up investments behind enhanced Emerging Markets capabilities and our global SAP implementation. 
Consistent with our efforts to improve global capabilities and enhanced innovation, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the completion of our European innovation and quality center in The Netherlands, which will open shortly. Our business results as I said a moment ago were again led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Emerging Markets delivered organic sales growth of more than 13% and would have been up well over 14% if it were not for the impact of the land Long Fong downsizing. Global Ketchup grew 5%. And our Top 15 Brands grew almost 5% despite the exit from T.G.I.F. meals, which reduced organic sales by almost 90 basis points. 
Emerging market results were led by Brazil, reflecting the strength of the Quero brands of tomatoes sauces, ketchup and vegetables, and the launch of Heinz tomato paste, and China behind the success of Foodstar. The recently acquired businesses have performed well been our initial expectations and both appear to have considerable upside.
Indonesia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East also grew quite strongly in the quarter. Taking a closer look at Brazil and China, Brazil delivered organic sales growth of 33% in the quarter, but improved value share is in a number of categories, including Ketchup, pasta sauces and vegetables. Importantly, we have commenced manufacturing Heinz tomato paste in Brazil, and will begin producing Heinz Ketchup locally next month to accelerate its distribution and availability. 
In China, our Ketchup condiments and sauces business delivered strong organic growth of around 20% driven by the momentum of our Master, Long Fong and Heinz brands. Our China's our strategy is focused on these 3 core brands with significant growth potential as we continue to expand across the country. This will be enhanced upon the completion of the Shanghai factory, which will increase our source bottling capacity in China by nearly 2/3 to support continued growth in the world's largest soy sauce market. Overall, Emerging Markets generated 23% in the company sales in the quarter. And given our success in Brazil, Russia and China in particular, we are aggressively evaluating both organic and M&A growth initiatives in these markets.
Our second growth engine, Global Ketchup, also performed well in the quarter led by solid sales increases in the U.S., Brazil and Russia. We still have considerable opportunity in Ketchup, condiments and sauces, which is a category now approaching 50% of total Heinz sales. We are focused in driving usage and share in our core casing and business in developed markets, while simultaneously introducing millions of new middle class consumers in Emerging Markets to Heinz Ketchup in our core soy sauce brands.
Marketing and M&A initiatives are being increasingly directed against large opportunity in condiments and sauces where we have proven we have a clear right to win. And finally, our Top 15 Brands delivered strong organic sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter, led by Heinz, Quero and ABC despite the aforementioned exit from T.G.I.F. meals. Notably, we have seen improvement in our U.S. business with around 65% of our consumer product portfolio now growing volume share. The share improvement reflects increased brand investments and better execution. 
As promised, we are taking significant action to return the U.S. profitable growth and we'll continue to do so. We have made progress on our Ore-Ida and Classico well we have a choice of value propositions while increasing market and innovation between both brands.
We are taking similar action to drive Heinz Ketchup growth in the U.S. and I am pleased with the response to our outreach in the Hispanic community, where we are building penetration and travel through multilingual advertising more affordable packaging like the $0.99 pouch. We continue to build excitement around our flagship products with new varieties like balsamic ketchup and Jalapeño ketchup, which we are launching on cyber Monday through a Facebook campaign. Additionally, to leverage our strong brand equity and reduce packaging material, we are also introducing PET ketchup bottles that are inspired by our iconic 14-ounce glass bottles. They're redesigned models are being offered in the recent sizes, which you will see on the shelves soon. This is a very clever refresh of our flagship Ketchup product that will enhance our merchandising and marketing utilities.
The U.S. team has also begun to make progress in all channels like drug and dollar stores to improve destroy more targeted product offerings aimed at value consumers. It's important to note that our efforts to strengthen and improve our largest and most important business are being lead by a significantly upgraded management team featuring a number of new appointments. I am pleased to announce once again Heinz is been ranked #1 in overall customer satisfaction among food manufacturers in the 2012 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all food manufacturers for the 13th consecutive year.
Europe had somewhat more difficult quarter than it experienced recently. However, on a relative basis our results compared favorably to our peers primarily due to strengthened U.K. behind solid innovation and great results in soup and the strength of our Russian business. In short we are holding our own in Europe despite an extremely challenging economic environment that they will discuss in a minute.
Finally I want to comment on 1 other second quarter highlight. This time a year ago, we were discussing challenges based by our U.S. Foodservice and Australian businesses and so they, I am pleased a device of that the actions we took over the past year have significantly improved the results from these 2 businesses.
Our second quarter results keep Heinz on tract to deliver our previously announced full year outlook for sales and profit. The full year we expect at least 4% organic sales growth in line with our results for the first 6 months. Constant currency EPS growth of 5% to 8% on a continuing operations basis, excluding special items in fiscal 2012, and strong operating free cash flow of $1 billion plus.
As a result, we are reaffirming our constant currency EPS outlook of $3.52 to $3.62. 
Before I turn the call over to Art, I want to share my perspective on the global economy and trends in consumer behavior. Obviously we are carefully monitoring the Eurozone crisis like our industry peers and we're working to assess whether the current market dislocations are of a temporary nature or systemically long term. We are seeing signs of European consumers in general are altering their food shopping and dining habits as the continent struggles with the debt crisis, steep unemployment and a variety of austerity and tax regimes. Like their U.S. counterparts, they are adapting to new economic realities and have developed a strong value mindset as result.
I have challenged our European businesses to see this as an opportunity rather than a rollback and believe we will put it the resiliently and successfully adapt to the economic trends and new consumer behavior in their markets. Here in the U.S., I have seen some signs of modest economic recovery and improving consumer confidence all although there's still great uncertainty in the fiscal cliff.
I don't expect robust economy growth in the U.S. in 2013, but I am encouraged by the progress in our U.S. businesses as we invest in our leading brands to drive growth. We need to remind ourselves that we saw staple products that enhance the foods that people enjoy everyday and we can successfully adapt to the new value orientation that we're a bit more flexible and nimble in our thinking.
I am still very bullish about the growth in Emerging Markets where Heinz has grown a the robust 16% rate year-to-date. Importantly, we are redeploying talent and investment behind our mercy market businesses and aggressively searching for new opportunities, while maintaining an appropriate level of investment in our key developed markets.
To win in this challenging environment, Heinz is focusing its severable for admitting the consumers changing needs, accelerating innovation across our brands and delivering even greater value for customers. With strong brands and balanced global portfolio, I believe that we are as well positioned to deliver to continue growth in the global economy as anyone. The economy remains challenging to say the least.
Our strategic continues to be focused on the long-term price of a significantly larger Emerging Markets business and global leadership in the very profitable Ketchup, condiments and sauces category. Reflecting our focus on driving global growth and shareholder value, I am pleased to announce that, Chief Operating Officer and emergent markets in South Pacific has been appointed to the Heinz Board of Directors. As the COO responsible for the fastest-growing markets, Frank will bring strong understanding of consumer trends and extensive as Rick S&P implementation experience our broad. In summary, our company remains focused on operating discipline, appropriate investment levels and profitable growth. And I believe we have the brands, the businesses, the talent and the strategy to enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Art and we'll be back later for your Q&A."

Today I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EPS g",1423,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EPS growth from all angles. First, on a continuing operations basis, excluding prior year special items, results increased 11% to $0.90, and excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange, EPS increased 14%.
On a total company reported basis, the EPS increased increase was even stronger, up 23%, reflecting $0.08 of one-time productivity charges in Q2 of last fiscal year. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard, foreign exchange reduced the top and bottom line by about 2.5%. Excluding this FX impact on a constant currency x items basis, sales grew 2.9%, driven by organic sales growth of 3.3%. Importantly, all of our segments posted positive organic sales growth in the quarter.
Gross margin was up 40 basis points and constant currency gross profit grew 4.1%. We continue to increase our investment in marketing and in additional capabilities. Operating income is up slightly despite the increased P&L investments. And finally, as mentioned, EPS was up nearly 14%.
As projected during last quarter's call, Q2 EPS benefited from a favorable tax rate at about 10%. This largely reflects foreign tax planning initiatives. In short, we delivered solid top and bottom line growth while with favorable tax rate enabled us to make significant investments in the business.
Looking at the key components around revenue growth. Organic sales growth of 3.3% was driven by both volume and price. Volume growth of 1.4% was led by U.S. consumer products, the U.K., Brazil, Russia and China sauces, partially offset by the declines in The Netherlands and Italy. Price improvements of 1.9% were led by Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, U.S. Foodservice and Continental Europe. And excluding the impact of the prior year decisions to exit T.G.I. frozen meals, and downsize our Long Fong frozen business in China, organic sales growth was 4.1% for the quarter. And finally, our top line was unfavorably impacted by 2 prior period divestitures and by foreign exchange.
Our 40 basis point improvement in gross margin was led by the U.S. businesses, along with Russia, Australia and Brazil. Market inflation of commodities was about 4% in the quarter, tomatoes, potatoes and sweeteners. And looking forward, we expect around 4% market inflation on the balance of the year, largely in line with our original projections.
Let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each one of our key segments. In North American consumer products, we're encouraged that the progress the team is making to drive profitable growth. Organic sales were up slightly as volume increased 1.2% and net price decreased 0.8% as we optimize price points on the Ore-Ida and Classico brands. Excluding the impact of selling off of Boston Market license and exit of T.G.I. frozen meals, U.S. retail sales grew by nearly 4% and our strongest performance in 9 quarters. Importantly, gross margin was up 70 basis points driven by strong productivity, while operating income reflected a significant increase in marketing spend.
Our U.S. Foodservice business posted excellent results for the quarter. Sales up more than 4% and profit up almost 27%. Net price increased about 4% driven by pricing actions taken in the second half last year to offset inflation. And volume was roughly flat overall reflecting current restaurant industry traffic trends.
The business posted strong gross margin and operating income growth as a result of higher sales, effective cost management and the benefit from prior year productivity initiatives. Across the platform, constant currency results in Europe were about flat for the quarter. Organic sales were slightly positive as double-digit growth in Russia was enough to offset the impact of a weak economy in soft category sales in Italy. U.K. volume was up despite cool weather during barbecue season, but net price was down. Importantly, market share gains were saved in our large soup, beans and ketchup businesses.
Higher gross margins, driven by productivity improvements, which outpaced that commodity inflation. And constant currency operating income was flat to prior year, driven by higher market investments, partially offset by lower SG&A spending.
Asia/Pacific posted very strong results with constant currency sales up 4% and profit up almost 27%. Organic sales growth was 4.1%. Emerging Markets continue to post strong growth while our developed markets also delivered organic sales growth in the quarter.
Volume was up nearly 2% led primarily by very strong growth in sauces in China and Indonesia, partially offset by Long Fong and the timing of Ramadan. Price was up more than 2%, driven by a double-digit increase in Indonesia to cover commodity inflation. The region achieved strong gross margin growth up 30 basis points driven by Australia, New Zealand and China. Both emerging and developed markets posted strong double-digit operating income growth.
And as Bill noted, we're very pleased with the turnaround in Australia. Operating income grew significantly this quarter, a result of a targeted actions we took to improve commercial capabilities, simplify the business, reduce costs and focus on better day to day execution.
Now turning to our Rest of World segment. We posted organic and constant currency sales growth of nearly 20% with all regions delivered double-digit organic sales growth. Volume increased by 6.5% led by Brazil where we achieved strong market share growth in vegetables, ketchup and pasta sauces. Notably, Quero recently began the #1 brand of vegetables in Brazil.
Mexico also achieved strong volume growth in the quarter as our Ketchup in baby food businesses attained record market shares and October. The net price increased by 13%, led by strong pricing in South America. Gross profit dollars increased with the gross margin decreased as a result of high inflation cost in Venezuela and operating income reflects lower profitability in Venezuela and increased investments in marketing capabilities in Brazil.
And moving to cash. Operating free cash flow was $155 million for the quarter, up $24 million driven by higher net income and slightly lower capital spending. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $62 million,, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year.
Let's take a very brief look at the results for the first half. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales are up 3.5%, operating income up almost 3% and EPS up more than 14%. For the first half, organic sales are up 4%, gross margin has increased and we've continued to invest in both marketing and capabilities.
The year-to-date tax rate is about 14% and drive EPS would fund our investments in the business. And looking at the balance sheet scorecard. Capital spending is flat to prior year as a percentage of revenue. Cash conversion cycle improved significantly, down 6 days to 38 days largely, driven by better inventory management. Year-to-date cash flow of $131 million is below prior year, due to the timing of receivable securitization and cash taxes. We expect is in the rate cash flow in the back of the fiscal year consistent with our typical annual phasing.
Net debt-to-EBITDA is flat to prior year and remains low at 2.1x. And ROIC has increased nearly 200 basis points, reflecting higher net income and the benefits from last year's productivity initiatives.
Now, let's switch gears, and I'd like to make a comments in the second half of the fiscal year. As Bill said, we are reaffirming our reason out top and bottom line outlook. The second half, we expect increased innovation and 4%-plus organic sales growth. Accelerating gross margin improvements, incremental investment of global marketing, Emerging Markets sales capabilities and the SAP program and higher effective tax rate, which is anticipated to be in the low- to mid-20s during the third quarter and a bit higher in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect the rate of around 20%. EPS should be at about the same level in Q3 and Q4 this year, which is in line with our full year constant currency outlook.
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment, driving strong top line growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands, delivering higher gross margin despite the difficult market environment and making significant investments in the business enabled by a favorable tax rate.

So generally Smart Ones was not as strong in the second quarter as I think we would have liked. We'll see how the season plays out.

And they think outside the U.S., doy pack continues to be an incredible will to the business and Indonesia, it's majority of our growth is coming in condiments and sauces, which is being led by doy packs, same thing in Russia. The launch in Mexico has been nothing more than heroic success in fact we can supply baby food in Mexico, we just started up another landing in Guadeljara but we are literally out-of-stock we launched 3 SKUs in baby food last year. We're now up to 5 soon to be 7 or 8. Our shares now in double digits and the same thing on Ketchup where we're now at close to 20 shares in Mexico from 0 3 or 4 years ago again most of that is being, driven by doy pack. We've launched in the U.K. so if doy pack is going to be a clear component of the company's success going forward, particularly given the price point, and in the U.S., I'm pleased with where we are in Hispanic markets and I think will see more upside going forward from doy pack.

And I think we feel pretty good about where we're headed from a volume standpoint once we get the noise of T.G.I.F. behind us and we do have touch rest the Smart Ones question that was raised earlier. I think from a profit standpoint, I would be very pleased to see with the U.S. company coming in plus or minus a few points versus last year. Will just depend on how much investment we make in the second half. We had a significant increase in I want to underline the word significant in the second quarter. We don't breakout marketing standing by business unit for a lot of obvious reasons. But it is not unreasonable to say marketing spending in the U.S. was up well into the double digits in the second quarter, the bulk of that behind Ketchup and the Hispanic advertising and some advertising in Southeast on Ore-Ida in addition to some stuff we have done on Classico and frankly on steps. So I think that I feel better about the prospects that the U.S. going forward from a top line standpoint and share standpoint most recent shares 65% volume growth in my comments, but in the last 4 weeks, volume share growth was almost 78% of the total business so we are seeing a response but there's no doubt that we are intentionally pressuring profits in the U.S. this year as we work to restore the top line growth. Fortunately, we're able to do that, that only because of the tax rate but because of the strength to food service business and the strength of our Emerging Markets businesses in terms of growing the bottom line. So I think one of the benefits of front of followed a company like we do use it gives us enormous amount of flexibility in terms of where we reprioritize investment. So it gives a significant investment increases in the U.S. as we continue to drive the topline."

If I could a lot of investment behind Smart Ones and I'm chasing a declining market, there's just not going to be the return I want. So as I said, breakfast is doing well, we do activity during the coming during the season in terms of innovation and some new products that we've got some interesting things over the longer term the deals over the next 6 to 12 months in Smart Ones. I certainly don't want to imply that we're working with the business because were in a district important to was but I think you can read into that, that the dollars we're allocating for investment in the freezer case were going to put first where we're getting our best return, which in this case right now is Ore-Ida and snacks and we'll manage the Smart Ones business the best way we can.

I continue to believe Ketchup is still an opportunity in the U.S. I think the new package launch in the U.S. behind something we have internally name for that basically leads to transforming the Ketchup category is something that's we're very excited about we've launched 38 and 34-ounce sizes.

So I think if you back Venezuela out of the Rest of the World, you'll see a dramatically different margin growth story, particularly in Brazil or I was very pleased we grew margin 200 to 300 basis points of the quarter in Brazil. I think the second thing that you need to keep in mind is we are coming off in the Rest of the World an incredible quarter last year. We are up 150 basis points, 150% last in operating profit. And so we knew Rest of World from a bottom line standpoint was not going to have the kind of quarter we had last year.

I think the qualification I'll give you the second half we see better leverage on the promotions side, that's where we'll go and having said that, I want to but clear that promotion spending is defined by deal spending for the company is not up year-on-year for the first half of the year. I would be anymore specific than that for a lot of reasons, but we are not up. So the opportunity to deploy differently will be predicated on the category, the country, the business and word the opportunities are. But we're still tracking for double-digit increase in marketing spend it on a constant currency basis, which is how we defined in May and for substantial improvement in capabilities around the company and we're seeing really good returns on that even SAP in Europe we're starting to see a very positive response from the investments in the Benelux a couple of years ago, Spain is gone extremely well, Germany has gone in well was alluded the German business in the rest of the Continental Europe when we sold the whatever business earlier this year.

Right now, Europe, you're dealing with various austerity and tax regimes that aren't working very well in the efficacy of those is being challenged. We've got consumer unhappiness throughout the European continent but, particularly in Southern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. we're seeing similar things happening in the U.S. as Foodservice traffic now sort of reflects the anticipation of what's going to happen with the cliff. I don't share the confidence and our political process and others seem to be believing in. And so I think from our standpoint, we're just seating until we know where we are. The other thing I will tell you, tax is never a certainty but, while we followed pretty good about where we are, things happen. And so I think we just want to keep where we're going and work from that. I'm pleased with the execution of the company, I'm pleased with where we're headed. I think Emerging Markets continue to look very promising and if anything, it would continue to invest in more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets before I'd probably put more into specific marketing. I mean, the boots on the ground is giving us a very solid tangible return in all of these markets. I'd like to see us do a little bit more in Indonesia and maybe a little bit more in India. And then we have a lot of other initiatives in place."

When and a look over the past 4 years, it's been did you see some significant volume declines across base of Europe, certainly Foodservice and North America? And here, it's notable that the first quarter I believe in a while where you had a negative divided price mix. So you were moderating for pricing commutes in sequential improvement in volumes. So I wondered if it seems like broadly in the food industry now, consumers have reacted to brand lowering prices by improving volume that's what the data is telling us. And is there do you expect a period where you're going to invest in price a little bit more to drive more volume? I know you've called out some categories that you that think are not worth it, but do you intend to keep that going and accelerate volume through it just these price investments are working in that direction?"

But I think a lot of what we are doing is being, driven by makes and the way that sizing, the price points in terms of smaller sizes and in terms of different kinds of recipes and so forth, Jonathan. But I think as I said a few minutes ago, and in response to David's question about marketing spend in the second half, if we believe we can generate a better return by leveraging more promotion as opposed to just generalized traditional marketing, that's the way we will go. But it will depend on the business. In ketchup right now in the U.S., we're getting a great response in very traditional advertising. As we are Ore-Ida after balancing what we needed to be on price in the Emerging Markets, we're getting very good price and that you could remember in those markets you have general inflation, which is also be reflected in wages and so forth, so the consumer is not us put off by price and private label is not a big issue. But I think generally, even in the developed world, private label's no longer showing the kind of growth they did it it's really going to be a function of creating value in the mind of the consumer, whether that value manifests itself in terms of better innovation, premium product, superior performance or a combination of promoted volume and/or better price points, it's just going to depend on the category and on where we think we'll getting the best return. And clearly, some of these businesses, price is going to be a better leverage than other businesses. Clearly, in other cases, market is going to be a better lever and what we're trying to do is to evaluate on the elasticity basis exactly where we get the greatest leverage."

We've got a lot of investment going into India. We also have SAP investment community second half of the year. And obviously, the finalization of the Innovation Center in Europe. There's a fair amount of capital investment established in the second half the year. Frankly, my perspective is the lower I can keep that number, the happier I am. As everybody works for me knows. The realities, given the pressure we have on volume in the Emerging Markets, we have to provide capacity. Says it, we put a new punchline into Mexico, we have a second one coming very shortly. We have a new punch line going to Brazil we have second one of those come in very shortly. We've got are starting to produce Ketchup in Brazil in the next 30 or 40 days. I think we've also got a fair amount of activity in the Asian markets, China in particular. It's an area we're going to have to put it to invest in. So I think will be right around that number. To be honest with you, if I'd have my numbers I don't bring it down but right now given the SAP implementation and the capacity needs a have in that business, I can't. The final things we're pretty much out of capacity and we're going to look at different squeeze were the plan goes is yet to be determined. It'll be interesting to see where that line goes I think you should not assume that line is automatically going into the U.S. if that is the line we will have to start talking about in the second half of the year because we're out of capacity in the Emerging Markets are all yelling and screaming at me afford the increased capabilities.

Secondly, innovation in the U.K. is up 50% year-on-year in the second half. We have a significant amount of innovation in the Emerging Markets, particularly behind couch initiatives. We've got significant amount of innovation coming in the U.S. more, which I'll detail at CAGNY. We have a lot of activity in other parts of Europe as well, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. So there's a significant amount of new product activity in the second half of the year and a significant response to the marketing spending that we have initiated in the first half the year from a much of this really didn't begin until the second quarter and you will see follow-through in the third quarter. So I think in that context, I feel reasonably sanguine. Let me underline those 2 words, reasonably sanguine, about strong volume growth or strong organic sales growth in the second half of the year. The Emerging Markets as I said last year at this time, relative to the second half should be much stronger in the second half for this year than they were in the first half of this year. We're seeing huge pickup in Brazil, hopefully the new Ketchup line will be ready. We've launched Heinz tomatoes paste it's doing very well. The enabling lines we've now put in Mexico allows to start shipping baby food more aggressively. What we're doing in Indonesia with the launch in the second half, which are all predominantly condiments and sauces launches. A lot of activity in terms of our expansion of our food condiments and sauces business in China, as well as some food service initiative and the focus on Ketchup to continue to the strength of Ketchup in the European condiment. And then just the general success of Russia should help us drive volume in the second half of the year. I feel pretty good about the third quarter. The fourth quarter is really where we're going to have the measurement year-on-year. But the forecast coming in from our operating teams are all pretty optimistic about volume growth there is organic sales growth in the second half the year so right now, we see no reason to backlog that than a reminder, we have generated about 4% in the first off this year and that's what we have the benefit of some of the marketing that you'll see in the second half."

So I would seats more second half story that it's the first half story and to be honest with you, I don't have any idea how much it was in the second quarter. I don't think it was very significant based on what I'm hearing from the operating team, so it's still going to be a second half and fiscal '14 story for the company, but we're so far behind where many of our peers are it still a big opportunity. And in terms of volume going forward I mean, clearly, and they are should you're talking to U.S. but if you're not, please let me know. I feel reasonably again reasonably good about the activities we have in the second half of the year. I think the management team in the U.S. is done an excellent job of refocusing on integration I was at the Innovation Center in North America weeks ago Friday and spend the whole afternoon with reviewing new product initiatives underway and some of the activities that'll start keeping the market late in this fiscal year, which will have some benefit in Q4 but really should have the bulk of their benefit next year beyond the pipeline fill. So again, lot of excuse me, a lot of activity in potatoes, a lot of activity and sauces and a lot of activity other areas that I think will be interesting. If you look at our business, the strongest category growth in any of our businesses in developed markets is vinegar, and barbecue sauces the U.S. Vinegar is growing as category a at double-digit rates as ROE and so we're going to leverage that and look for opportunities there as well.

I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. Starting with the second quarter. Heinz delivered EPS of $0.90 fro",1695,"Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. Heinz delivered EPS of $0.90 from continuing operations with organic sales growth of between 3% and 4%, our 30th consecutive quarter of organic top line growth. These results reflect a nice balance between volume and pricing and strength in our 3 engines of growth: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Second quarter earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate that we leveraged to significantly increase investment in marketing and global capabilities to drive further growth. Importantly, we increased marketing spend by over 13% in the quarter on a constant currency basis with a particularly large increase in North America where I am encouraged by our recent momentum. We're also continuing to ramp up investments behind enhanced Emerging Markets capabilities and our global SAP implementation. 
Consistent with our efforts to improve global capabilities and enhanced innovation, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the completion of our European Innovation and Quality Center in The Netherlands, which will open shortly. 
Our business results, as I said a moment ago, were again led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Emerging Markets delivered organic sales growth of more than 13% and would have been up well over 14% were it not for the impact of the planned Long Fong downsizing. Global Ketchup grew 5%. And our Top 15 Brands grew almost 5% despite the exit from T.G.I.F. meals, which reduced organic sales by about 90 basis points. 
Emerging market results were led by Brazil, reflecting the strength of the Quero brand of tomatoes sauces, ketchup and vegetables and the launch of Heinz tomato paste in China behind the success of Foodstar. These 2 recently acquired businesses have performed well beyond our initial expectations and both appear to have considerable upside. Indonesia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East also grew quite strongly in the quarter. 
Taking a closer look at Brazil and China. Brazil delivered organic sales growth of 33% in the quarter with improved value shares in a number of categories, including ketchup, pasta sauces and vegetables. Importantly, we have commenced manufacturing Heinz tomato paste in Brazil and will begin producing Heinz Ketchup locally next month to accelerate its distribution and availability. 
In China, our ketchup condiments and sauces business delivered strong organic growth of around 20%, driven by the momentum of our Master, Long Fong and Heinz brands. Our China sauce strategy is focused on these 3 core brands with significant growth potential as we continue to expand across the country. This will be enhanced upon the completion of the Shanghai factory, which will increase our soy sauce bottling capacity in China by nearly 2/3 to support continued growth in the world's largest soy sauce market. 
Overall, Emerging Markets generated 23% of the company sales in the quarter. And given our success in Brazil, Russia and China, in particular, we are aggressively evaluating both organic and M&A growth initiatives in these markets.
Our second growth engine, Global Ketchup, also performed well in the quarter led by solid sales increases in the U.S., Brazil and Russia. We still have considerable opportunity in ketchup, condiments and sauces, which, as a category, is now approaching 50% of total Heinz sales. We are focused on driving usage and share in our core KC&S business in developed markets while simultaneously introducing millions of new middle class consumers in emerging markets to Heinz Ketchup and our core soy sauce brands. Marketing and M&A initiatives are being increasingly directed against a large opportunity in condiments and sauces where we have proven that we have a clear right to win. 
And finally, our Top 15 Brands delivered strong organic sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter, led by Heinz, Quero and ABC despite the aforementioned exit from T.G.I.F. meals. Notably, we have seen improvement in our U.S. business with around 65% of our consumer products portfolio now growing volume share. The share improvement reflects increased brand investment and better execution. As promised, we are taking significant action to return the U.S. to profitable growth and we'll continue to do so. We have made progress on Ore-Ida and Classico where we have addressed the value propositions while increasing marketing and innovation behind both brands.
We are taking similar action to drive Heinz Ketchup growth in the U.S. and I'm pleased with the response to our outreach in the Hispanic community where we are building penetration and trail through multilingual advertising and more affordable packaging like the $0.99 pouch. 
We continue to build excitement around our flagship product with new varieties like Balsamic Ketchup and Jalapeño Ketchup, which we are launching on Cyber Monday through a Facebook campaign. 
Additionally, to leverage our strong brand equity and reduce packaging material, we are also introducing new PET ketchup bottles that are inspired by our iconic 14-ounce glass bottles. The redesigned models are being offered in a range of sizes, which you will see on the shelf soon. This is a very clever refresh of our flagship ketchup product that will enhance our merchandising and marketing capabilities.
The U.S. team has also begun to make progress in alternate channels like drug and dollar stores through improved distribution and more targeted product offerings aimed at value-oriented consumers. 
It's important to note that our efforts to strengthen and improve our largest and most important business are being led by a significantly upgraded management team featuring a number of new appointments. Parenthetically, I am pleased to announce that, once again, Heinz has been ranked #1 in overall customer satisfaction among food manufacturers in the 2012 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all food manufacturers for the 13th consecutive year.
Europe had a somewhat more difficult quarter than we have experienced recently. However, on a relative basis, our results compared favorably to our peers, primarily due to strength in the U.K. behind solid innovation and great results in soup and the strength of our Russian business. In short, we are holding our own in Europe despite an extremely challenging economic environment that I will discuss in a minute.
Finally, I want to comment on one other second quarter highlight. This time a year ago, we were discussing challenges faced by our U.S. Foodservice and Australian businesses. And today, I'm pleased to advise you that the actions we took over the past year have significantly improved the results from these 2 businesses.
Our second quarter results keep Heinz on track to deliver our previously announced full year outlook for sales and profit. For the full year, we expect at least 4% organic sales growth, in line with our results for the first 6 months; constant currency EPS growth of 5% to 8% on a continuing operations basis, excluding special items in fiscal 2012; and strong operating free cash flow of $1 billion-plus. As a result, we are reaffirming our constant currency EPS outlook of $3.52 to $3.62. 
But before I turn the call over to Art, I want to share my perspective on the global economy and trends in consumer behavior. Obviously, we are carefully monitoring the eurozone crisis like our industry peers, and we are working to assess whether the current market dislocations are of a temporary nature or systemically long term. We are seeing signs that European consumers, in general, are altering their food shopping and dining habits as the continent struggles with the debt crisis, steep unemployment and a variety of austerity in tax regimes. Like their U.S. counterparts, they are adapting to new economic realities and they have developed a strong value mindset as result. I have challenged our European businesses to see this as an opportunity rather than a roadblock and believe we will continue to resiliently and successfully adapt to the economic trends and new consumer behavior in their markets. 
Here in the U.S., I have seen some signs of modest economic recovery and improving consumer confidence although there is still great uncertainty as the fiscal cliff looms. I don't expect robust economic growth in the U.S. in 2013, but I am encouraged by the progress in our U.S. business as we invest in our leading brands to drive growth. 
We need to remind ourselves that we sell staple products that enhance the foods that people enjoy everyday, and we can successfully adapt to the new value orientation if we're a bit more flexible and nimble in our thinking.  I'm still very bullish about the growth in Emerging Markets where Heinz has grown at a robust 16% rate year-to-date. Importantly, we are redeploying talent and investment behind our Emerging Market businesses and aggressively searching for new opportunities while maintaining an appropriate level of investment in our key developed markets.
To win in this challenging environment, Heinz is focusing as never before on meeting the consumers' changing needs, accelerating innovation across our brands and delivering even greater value for our customers. With strong brands and a balanced global portfolio, I believe that we are as well positioned to deliver continued growth in the global economy as anyone. The economy remains challenging to say the least.
Our strategic continues to be focused on the long-term price of a significantly larger Emerging Markets business and global leadership in the very profitable ketchup, condiments and sauces category. Reflecting our focus on driving global growth and shareholder value, I am pleased to announce that Frank Moison, Colgate's Chief Operating Officer, Emergent Markets and South Pacific, has been appointed to the Heinz Board of Directors. As the COO responsible for Colgate's fastest-growing global markets, Frank will bring a strong international perspective, a keen understanding of global consumer trends and extensive SAP implementation experience to our board. 
In summary, our company remains focused on operating discipline, appropriate investment levels and profitable growth. And I believe we have the brands, the businesses, the talent and the strategy to enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Art, and will be back later for your Q&A."
278212,224047292,390399,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 20, 2012",2012-11-20,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EP",1431,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. 
For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EPS growth from all angles. First, on a continuing operations basis, excluding prior year special items, results increased 11% to $0.90. And excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange, EPS increased 14%. On a total company reported basis, EPS increase was even stronger, up 23%, reflecting $0.08 of onetime productivity charges in Q2 of last fiscal year. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard. Foreign exchange reduced the top and bottom line by about 2.5%. Excluding this FX impact on a constant currency x items basis, sales grew 2.9%, driven by organic sales growth at 3.3%. Importantly, all of our segments posted positive organic sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin was up 40 basis points and constant currency gross profit grew 4.1%. We continue to increase our investment in marketing and in additional capabilities. Operating income was up slightly despite the increased P&L investments. And finally, as mentioned, EPS was up nearly 14%.
As projected during last quarter's call, Q2 EPS benefited from a favorable tax rate at about 10%. This largely reflects foreign tax planning initiatives. In short, we delivered solid top and bottom line growth while a favorable tax rate enabled us to make significant investments in the business.
Looking at the key components to revenue growth. Organic sales growth of 3.3% was driven by both volume and price. Volume growth of 1.4% was led by U.S. consumer products, the U.K., Brazil, Russia and China sauces, partially offset by declines in The Netherlands and Italy. Price improvements of 1.9% were led by Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, U.S. Foodservice and Continental Europe. And excluding the impact of the prior year decisions to exit T.G.I. frozen meals and downsize our Long Fong frozen business in China, organic sales growth was 4.1% for the quarter. And finally, our top line was unfavorably impacted by 2 prior period divestitures and by foreign exchange.
Our 40 basis point improvement in gross margin was led by the U.S. businesses along with Russia, Australia and Brazil. Market inflation on commodities was about 4% in the quarter led by tomatoes, potatoes and sweeteners. And looking forward, we expect around 4% market inflation on the balance of the year, largely in line with our original projections.
Now let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each one of our key segments. In North American Consumer Product, we are encouraged at the progress the team is making to drive profitable growth. Organic sales were up slightly as volume increased 1.2% and net price decreased 0.8% since we optimize price points on the Ore-Ida and Classico brands. Excluding the impact of selling off the Boston Market license and the exit of T.G.I. frozen meals, U.S. retail sales grew by nearly 4%, our strongest performance in 9 quarters. Importantly, gross margin was up 70 basis points, driven by strong productivity while operating income reflected a significant increase in marketing spending.
Our U.S. Foodservice business posted excellent results for the quarter with sales up more than 4% and profit up almost 27%. Net price increased about 4%, driven by pricing actions taken in the second half of last year to offset inflation. And volume was roughly flat overall, reflecting current restaurant industry traffic trends. The business posted strong gross margin and operating income growth as a result of higher sales, effective cost management and the benefit from prior year productivity initiatives. 
Across the pond, constant currency results in Europe were about flat for the quarter. Organic sales were slightly positive as double-digit growth in Russia was enough to offset the impact of a weak economy and soft category sales in Italy. U.K. volume was up despite cool weather during barbecue season, but net price was down. Importantly, market share gains were achieved in our large soup, beans and ketchup businesses. Higher gross margin was driven by productivity improvements, which outpaced net commodity inflation. And constant currency operating income was flat to prior year, driven by a higher marketing investment, partially offset by lower SG&A spending.
Asia/Pacific posted very strong results with constant currency sales up 4% and profit up almost 27%. Organic sales growth was 4.1%. Emerging Markets continue to post strong growth while our developed markets also delivered organic sales growth in the quarter. Volume was up nearly 2%, led primarily by very strong growth in sauces in China and Indonesia, partially offset by Long Fong and the timing of Ramadan. Price was up more than 2%, driven by a double-digit increase in Indonesia to cover commodity inflation. The region achieved strong gross margin growth, up 130 basis points, driven by Australia, New Zealand and China. Both emerging and developed markets posted strong double-digit operating income growth.
And as Bill noted, we're very pleased with the turnaround in Australia. Operating income grew significantly this quarter, a result of the targeted actions we took to improve commercial capabilities, simplify the business, reduce costs and focus on better day-to-day execution.
Now turning to our Rest of World segment. We posted organic and constant currency sales growth of nearly 20% with all regions delivering double-digit organic sales growth. Volume increased by 6.5% led by Brazil where we achieved strong market share growth in vegetables, ketchup and pasta sauce. Notably, Quero recently became the #1 brand of vegetables in Brazil. Mexico also achieved strong volume growth in the quarter as our ketchup and baby food businesses attained record market shares in October. And net pricing increased by 13%, led by strong pricing in South America. Gross profit dollars increased, but gross margin decreased as a result of high inflation costs in Venezuela. And operating income reflects lower profitability in Venezuela and increased investments in marketing capabilities in Brazil.
Now moving to cash. Operating free cash flow was $155 million for the quarter, up $24 million, driven by higher net income and slightly lower capital spending. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $62 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year.
Now let's take a very brief look at the results for the first half. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales are up 3.5%, operating income up almost 3% and EPS up more than 14%. For the first half, organic sales were up 4%, gross margin has increased and we've continued to invest in both marketing and capabilities.
The year-to-date tax rate is about 14% and this helped drive EPS and fund our investments in the business. 
Now looking at the balance sheet scorecard. Capital spending is flat to prior year as a percentage of revenue. Cash conversion cycle improved significantly, down 6 days to 38 days, largely driven by better inventory management. Year-to-date cash flow of $131 million is below prior year due to the timing of receivable securitization and cash taxes. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt-to-EBITDA is flat to prior year and remains low at 2.1x. And ROIC has increased nearly 200 basis points, reflecting higher net income and the benefits from last year's productivity initiatives.
Now, let's switch gears and I'd like to make a couple of comments on the second half of the fiscal year. As Bill said today, we are reaffirming our original top and bottom line outlook. In the second half, we expect increased innovation and 4%-plus organic sales growth, accelerating gross margin improvements, incremental investment in global marketing, Emerging Markets sales capabilities and the SAP program and a higher effective tax rate, which is anticipated to be in the low to mid-20s during the third quarter and a bit higher in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect a rate of around 20%. EPS should be at about the same level in Q3 and Q4 this year, which is in line with our full year constant currency outlook.
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment, driving strong top line growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands, delivering higher gross margin despite the difficult market environment and making significant investments in the business enabled by a favorable tax rate.

Currently, what we're seeing is very strong performance on our breakfast business, good performance in some of our sides in terms of the snacks. In our base entree business, we are not promoting as aggressively as maybe we could and that's a decision we've made. And so the focus has really been in frozen on getting Ore-Ida and our snacks business growing, which we did very successfully in the second quarter. So generally, Smart Ones was not as strong in the second quarter as I think we would have liked. We'll see how the season plays out. But my bigger issue, Alexia, continues to be the nutritional category where the industry has lost about 1/3 of its sales over the last 5 years. And so rather than chasing volume in a category that's still not sure where it's going, we're planning on innovation.

In other markets, I think we need to do a better job of getting a more prominent distribution. But generally, it's playing in line in most markets with where we thought it would be and the Hispanic markets doing much better. I think outside the U.S., DOYPACK continues to be an incredible boon to the business. In Indonesia, it's -- majority of our growth is coming in condiments and sauces, which is being led by DOYPACKs; same thing in Russia. The launch in Mexico has been nothing more than a heroic success. In fact, we can't supply baby food in Mexico. We've just started up another line in Guadalajara, but we are literally out of stock. We launched 3 SKUs in baby food last year. We're now up to 5, soon to be 7 or 8. Our share is now in double digits. And the same thing on ketchup where we're now close to a 20 share in Mexico from 0 three or four years ago. And again, most of that is being driven by DOYPACK. We've launched it in the U.K. So DOYPACK is going to be a clear component of the company's success going forward, particularly given the price point. And in the U.S., I'm pleased with where we are in the Hispanic markets and I think we'll see more upside going forward from DOYPACK. And I think the other thing you can count on is a lot more DOYPACK initiatives around the company, both in developed and emerging markets going beyond just ketchup."

First, if you back out T.G.I.F. in the quarter, the U.S. business was up over 4 points in volume growth. So the U.S. business is responding to the marketing, which is, frankly, a balance of promotion and media and traditional marketing support. And I think we feel pretty good about where we're headed from a volume standpoint once we get the noise of T.G.I.F. behind us and we do have to address the Smart Ones question that was raised earlier. I think from a profit standpoint, I would be very pleased this year with the U.S. company coming in plus or minus a few points versus last year. It will just depend on how much investment we make in the second half. We had a significant increase, and I want to underline the word significant in the second quarter. We don't break out marketing spending by business unit for a lot of obvious reasons. But it is not unreasonable to say marketing spending in the U.S. was up well into the double digits in the second quarter, the bulk of that behind ketchup and the Hispanic advertising and some advertising in the Southeast and Ore-Ida in addition to some stuff we have done on Classico and frankly on snacks. So I think that I feel better about the prospects of the U.S. going forward from a top line standpoint and a share standpoint. The most recent share, as I said, 65% volume growth in my comments. But in the last 4 weeks, volume share growth was almost 78% of the total business, so we are seeing a response. But there's no doubt that we are intentionally pressuring profits in the U.S. this year as we work to restore the top line growth. Fortunately, we're able to do that not only because of the tax rate, but because of the strength of the Foodservice business and the strength of our Emerging Markets businesses in terms of growing the bottom line. So I think one of the benefits to running a portfolio company like we do is it gives us an enormous amount of flexibility in terms of where we reprioritize investment. And so I think you'll see significant investment increases in the U.S. as we continue to drive the top line."

And right now, I'm getting a significant positive return on Ore-Ida, I'm seeing a good response in frozen snacks and I'm seeing a terrific growth upside in ketchup. And so, as a consequence of that, we'll put the investments behind where we're seeing the growth. If I put a lot of investment behind Smart Ones and I'm chasing a declining market, there's just not going to be the return I want. So as I said, breakfast is doing well. You continue to see us focused on breakfast. We've got a lot of new activity coming during the season in terms of innovation and some new products. And then we've got some interesting things over the longer term that you'll see over the next 6 to 12 months in Smart Ones. I certainly don't want to imply that we're walking away from the business because we're not. it's critically important to us. But I think you can read into that, that the dollars we're allocating for investment in the freezer case we're going to put first where we're getting our best return, which, in this case right now, is Ore-Ida and snacks and we'll manage the Smart Ones business the best way we can. And right now, I will tell you that I still think innovation and marketing behind Smart Ones is the way to go rather than get into a football promotion initiative that ultimately nobody wins.

That's one of the reasons you saw the margin improvement in the quarter because our investments behind our leading margin brands, which would be ketchup and Ore-Ida, gave us a good response in the quarter and I think so we're going to continue to balance it. And I've been very pleased with the turnaround in Ore-Ida. I continue to believe ketchup is still an opportunity in the U.S. I think the new package launch in the U.S. behind something we have an internal name for that basically leads to transforming the ketchup category is something that we're very excited about. We've launched 38- and 34-ounce sizes and in specialty items in 14-ounce sizes. The consumer response in research has been extraordinary. The Hispanic response in terms of where we are with our marketing efforts has been great. So what we're doing is we're choosing and prioritizing against where we think the greatest leverage is to the P&L and to the top line. And so yes, I mean, it's not necessarily an issue of triage, but it is going to be an issue who's going to give me the best return for incremental dollars."

And part of the issue in Venezuela relates to the timing of the elections and the trade backing off in terms of buying product and the inflation rate, which we have not been able to price up to in the Venezuelan market. So I think if you back Venezuela out of the Rest of the World, you'll see a dramatically different margin growth story, particularly in Brazil where I was very pleased we grew margin of 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter in Brazil. I think the second thing that you need to keep in mind is we are coming off in the Rest of the World an incredible quarter last year. We are up 150 basis point slam and a 150% last year on operating profit. And so we knew Rest of World from a bottom line standpoint was not going to have the kind of quarter we had last year. But I have to tell you the Brazilian business has been nothing more than a continued surprise to me in terms of how well it is doing. We're seeing continued growth in Mexico, great performance in the rest of Latin America Latin America x Venezuela and really strong results coming out of the Middle East. And so I feel pretty good about where we are. But Venezuela is the story of the Rest of World in the second quarter in terms of the dilution on margin. And that will address itself over time as the they finish the elections in December on the state basis and then we get some clarity on what's going to happen going forward."

And I will tell you some of that marketing may be deployed a little differently in the second half of the year. We may put some back in promotion depending on the market and depending on where we are. But we are still on track for the investments, significant investments, and boots on the ground in the Emerging Markets. And it's really interesting, if you look at the 3 markets that benefited the most, China condiments and sauces, Russia and Brazil and so those are our 3 best-performing Emerging Market businesses along with Indonesia during the second quarter and through the first half of the year. I mean, Russia sales organically were up around 14%. Obviously, condiments and sauces that you saw in China up around 20% and Brazil up around 33%. So we're seeing a very good response from that. We've made significant investments in SAP, particularly in Canada and now in Europe. We've just turned Spain on following the success in Germany. So we continue to roll out those investments. Marketing spend, as I said, on a constant currency basis, is up 8% to 10% so for this year, very strong in the second quarter. So we're about where we thought we would be, David. I think the qualification I'll give you is in the second half, that we see better leverage on the promotions side that's where we'll go. Now having said that, I want to be clear that promotion spending as defined by deal spending for the company is not up year-on-year through the first half of the year. I won't be anymore specific than that for a lot of reasons, but we are not up. So the opportunity to deploy differently will be predicated on the category, the country, the business and where the opportunities are. But we're still tracking for a double-digit increase in marketing spending on the year on a constant currency basis, which is how we defined it in May, and through a substantial improvement in capabilities around the company and we're seeing really good returns on that. Even SAP in Europe, we're starting to see a very positive response from the investments in the Benelux a couple of years ago. Spain has gone in extremely well. Germany has gone in well and it allowed us to consolidate the German business into the rest of Continental Europe when we sold the Sonnen business earlier this year. So our plans have not changed. The prioritization of how those dollars are allocated may be modified a bit in the second half."

You tell me how the fiscal cliff is going to be resolved. You tell me how Europe is going to be resolved. You tell me what's going to happen to currency in the second half of the year. You tell me what's going to happen to consumer confidence. And so right now, we're sort of sitting pat until we get a better sense certainly as we approach the end of this calendar year and into the beginning of next calendar year how all this stuff unfolds. I mean, right now, in Europe you're dealing with various austerity in tax regimes that aren't working very well and the efficacy of those is being challenged. We've got consumer unhappiness throughout the European continent, but particularly in Southern Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula. We're seeing similar things happening in the U.S. as foodservice traffic now sort of reflects the anticipation of what's going to happen with the cliff. I don't share the confidence in our political process that others seem to be believing in. And so I think from our standpoint, we're just seating until we know where we are. The other thing I will tell you, tax is never a certainty. While we feel pretty good about where we are, things happen and so I think we just want to keep where we are going and work from that. I'm pleased with the execution of the company. I'm pleased with where we're headed. I think Emerging Markets continue to look very promising. And if anything, I will continue to invest in more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets before I probably put more into specific marketing. I mean, the boots on the ground is giving us a very solid tangible return in all these markets. I'd like to see us do a little bit more in Indonesia and maybe a little bit more in India.

And now here, it's notable the first quarter, I believe, in a while where you had a negative price mix in those, so you were moderating pricing. You've seen sequential improvement in volumes. So I wondered if it seems like broadly in the food industry now, consumers have reacted to brands lowering price by improving volume. That's what the data is telling us and is there -- do you expect a period where you're going to invest in price a little bit more to drive more volume? I know you've called out some categories that you don't think are worth it, but do you intend to keep that going and accelerate volume through?

But yes, I mean I think, as I said a few minutes ago, in response to David's question about marketing spend in the second half, if we believe we can generate a better return by leveraging more promotion as opposed to just generalized traditional marketing, that's the way we will go. But it will depend on the business. In ketchup right now in the U.S., we're getting a great response from very traditional advertising as we are in Ore-Ida after balancing where we needed to be on price. In the Emerging Markets, we're getting very good price and the thing you got to remember in those markets is you have general inflation, which is also being reflected in the wages and so forth. So the consumer is not as put off by price and private label is not a big issue. But I think, generally, even in the developed world, private label's no longer showing the kind of growth they did and it's really going to be a function of creating value in the mind of the consumer whether that value manifests itself in terms of better innovation, premium product, superior performance or a combination of promoted volume and/or better price points. It's just going to depend on the category and on where we think we're getting the best return. And clearly, in some of these businesses, price is going to be a better lever than other businesses. Clearly, in other cases, marketing is going to be the better lever and what we're trying to do is evaluate on elasticity basis exactly where we get the greatest leverage."

We could be 3.7%, we could be 3.9% because we have a lot of investments in the second half of the year in the Emerging Markets. We're just finishing the Shanghai factory, which I'm hoping will be open early in the new calendar year. We have started the Foshan, China baby food factory, which we're going to try to have open in 2015. We've got a lot of investment going into India. We also have SAP investment coming in the second half of the year. And obviously, the finalization of the Innovation Center in Europe. So there's a fair amount of capital investment established in the second half the year. Frankly, my perspective is the lower I can keep that number, the happier I am as everybody who works for me knows. The reality is given the pressure we have on volume in the Emerging Markets, we have to provide capacity. As I said, we put a new pouch line into Mexico, we have a second one coming very shortly. We have a new pouch line going into Brazil. We're going to have a second one of those coming very shortly. We've got -- we are starting to produce ketchup in Brazil in the next 30 or 40 days. I think you've also got a fair amount of activity in the Asian markets, China, in particular. It's an area we're going to have to continue to invest in, but -- so I think we'll be right around that number. To be honest with you, if I had my druthers, I'd try to bring it down. But right now, given the SAP implementation and capacity needs I have in that business, I can't. The final thing is we're pretty much out of capacity on Dip & Squeeze. We're going to look at a fork line on Dip & Squeeze. Where that line goes is yet to be determined. It'll be interesting to see where that line goes. I think you should not assume that line is automatically going into the U.S if that is the line that we will have to start talking about in the second half of the year because we're out of capacity and the Emerging Markets are all yelling and screaming at me for Dip & Squeeze capabilities. So it's mainly about SAP implementation and about adding capacity in the Emerging Markets where we're getting significant growth."

Secondly, innovation in the U.K. is up 50% year-on-year in the second half. We have a significant amount of innovation in the Emerging Markets, particularly behind pouch initiatives. We've got significant amount of innovation coming in the U.S. more, which I'll detail at CAGNY. We have a lot of activity in other parts of Europe as well, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. So there's a significant amount of new product activity in the second half of the year and a significant response to the marketing spending that we've initiated in the first half the year, much of which really didn't begin until the second quarter and you'll see a follow-through in the third quarter. So I think in that context, I feel reasonably sanguine. Let me underline those 2 words, reasonably sanguine, about strong volume growth or strong organic sales growth in the second half of the year. The Emerging Markets, as I said, last year at this time, relative to the second half, should be much stronger in the second half of this year than they were in the first half of this year. We're seeing huge pickup in Brazil. Hopefully, the new ketchup line will be ready. We've launched Heinz tomatoes paste. It's doing very well. The enabling lines we've now put in Mexico will allow us to start shipping baby food more aggressively. What we're doing in Indonesia with the launches in the second half, which are all predominantly condiments and sauces launches; a lot of activity in terms of our expansion of our food -- of our condiments and sauces business in China, as well as some food service initiative; and the focus on ketchup, the continued strength of ketchup in the European continent; and then just the general success of Russia should help us drive volume in the second half of the year. I feel pretty good about the third quarter. The fourth quarter is really where we're going to have the big measurement year-on-year. But the forecast coming in from our operating teams are all pretty optimistic about volume growth. There is organic sales growth in the second half of the year. So right now, we see no reason to back off that. And I'll remind you, we have generated about 4% through the first off this year and that's without the benefit of some of the marketing that you'll see in the second half."

It wasn't much because we're just now in the process of getting it on the shelf, certainly in Dollar General and some of the other stores. Pharmacy is coming along quite well. We're still grossly underdeveloped in both channels. So I would say it's more a second half story that it is a first half story. And to be honest with you, I don't have any idea how much it was in the second quarter. I don't think it was very significant based on what I'm hearing from the operating team. So I think it's still going to be a second half, hence, fiscal '14 story for the company. But we're so far behind where many of our peers are that it's still a big opportunity. And in terms of volume going forward, I mean, clearly -- and I assume you're talking the U.S. but if you're not, please let me know, I feel reasonably -- again, reasonably good about the activities we have in the second half of the year. I think the management team in the U.S. has done an excellent job on refocusing on innovation. I was at the Innovation Center in North America a week ago Friday and spent the whole afternoon with them reviewing a litany of the new product initiatives underway and some of the activities that will start hitting the market late in this fiscal year, which will have some benefit in Q4, but really should have the bulk of their benefit next year beyond pipeline fill. So again, a lot of -- excuse me, a lot of activity in potatoes, a lot of activity in sauces and a lot of activity in some other areas that I think will be interesting. If you look at our business, the strongest category growth in any of our businesses in developed markets is vinegar and barbecue sauce in the U.S. Vinegar is growing as a category at a double-digit rates as are we and so we're going to leverage that and look for opportunities there as well. So again, I think there's some opportunities in the second half of the year to drive better volume than we did in the first half in the U.S. company."

The Republicans want to keep it at 15 points plus a 3.8%. So I think there's likelihood to be some kind of compromise on dividend tax. Secondly, most of our investors, Eric, are still telling us they'd prefer to see it in the form of dividends and share buybacks. And so our strategy continues to be, in terms of the deployment of cash, M&A, and as I said we have an aggressive pipeline full of M&A. A lot of initiatives underway, several of which I hope would get done sooner rather than later, but we'll see. As you know that's a tricky game. And then the second use would be cash and then obviously we'll continue to buy back stock in order to prevent dilution from outstanding shares. But right now, we don't see a change. I don't how the fiscal cliff is going to manifest itself, how's it going to manage out. Obviously, if we start hearing from our investors and we start seeing a dramatic shift, then we'll be flexible in terms of what's going to create the most value. It's just right now our belief is based on what we're hearing that dividends are still the best way for us to deploy cash back to our investors. That may change. And if it does, then obviously we'll modify our approach but, right now that's where we are."

I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. Starting with the second quarter. Heinz delivered EPS of $0.90",1698,"Thank you, Meg, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. Heinz delivered EPS of $0.90 from continuing operations with organic sales growth of between 3% and 4%, our 30th consecutive quarter of organic top line growth. These results reflect a nice balance between volume and pricing and strength in our 3 engines of growth: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Second quarter earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate that we leveraged to significantly increase investment in marketing and global capabilities to drive further growth. Importantly, we increased marketing spend by over 13% in the quarter on a constant currency basis with a particularly large increase in North America where I am encouraged by our recent momentum. We also continue to ramp up investments behind enhanced Emerging Markets capabilities and our global SAP implementation. 
Consistent with our efforts to improve global capabilities and enhanced innovation, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the completion of our European Innovation and Quality Center in The Netherlands, which will open shortly. 
Our business results, as I said a moment ago, were again led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Emerging Markets delivered organic sales growth of more than 13% and would have been up well over 14% were it not for the impact of the planned Long Fong downsizing. Global Ketchup grew 5%. And our Top 15 Brands grew almost 5% despite the exit from T.G.I.F. meals, which reduced organic sales by about 90 basis points. 
Emerging market results were led by Brazil, reflecting the strength of the Quero brand of tomatoes sauces, ketchup and vegetables and the launch of Heinz tomato paste in China behind the success of Foodstar. These 2 recently acquired businesses have performed well beyond our initial expectations and both appear to have considerable upside. Indonesia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East also grew quite strongly in the quarter. 
Taking a closer look at Brazil and China. Brazil delivered organic sales growth of 33% in the quarter with improved value shares in a number of categories, including ketchup, pasta sauces and vegetables. Importantly, we have commenced manufacturing Heinz tomato paste in Brazil and will begin producing Heinz Ketchup locally next month to accelerate its distribution and availability. 
In China, our ketchup, condiments and sauces business delivered strong organic growth of around 20%, driven by the momentum of our Master, Long Fong and Heinz brands. Our China sauce strategy is focused on these 3 core brands with significant growth potential as we continue to expand across the country. This will be enhanced upon the completion of the Shanghai factory, which will increase our soy sauce bottling capacity in China by nearly 2/3 to support continued growth in the world's largest soy sauce market. 
Overall, Emerging Markets generated 23% of the company's sales in the quarter. And given our success in Brazil, Russia and China, in particular, we are aggressively evaluating both organic and M&A growth initiatives in these markets.
Our second growth engine, Global Ketchup, also performed well in the quarter led by solid sales increases in the U.S., Brazil and Russia. We still have considerable opportunity in ketchup, condiments and sauces, which, as a category, is now approaching 50% of total Heinz sales. We are focused on driving usage and share in our core KC&S business in developed markets while simultaneously introducing millions of new middle class consumers in emerging markets to Heinz Ketchup and our core soy sauce brands. Marketing and M&A initiatives are being increasingly directed against a large opportunity in condiments and sauces where we have proven that we have a clear right to win. 
And finally, our Top 15 Brands delivered strong organic sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter, led by Heinz, Quero and ABC despite the aforementioned exit from T.G.I.F. meals. Notably, we have seen improvement in our U.S. business with around 65% of our consumer products portfolio now growing volume share. The share improvement reflects increased brand investment and better execution. As promised, we are taking significant action to return the U.S. to profitable growth and we'll continue to do so. We have made progress on Ore-Ida and Classico where we have addressed the value propositions while increasing marketing and innovation behind both brands.
We are taking similar action to drive Heinz Ketchup growth in the U.S. and I'm pleased with the response to our outreach in the Hispanic community where we are building penetration and trail through multilingual advertising and more affordable packaging like the $0.99 pouch. 
We continue to build excitement around our flagship product with new varieties like Balsamic Ketchup and Jalapeño Ketchup, which we are launching on Cyber Monday through a Facebook campaign. 
Additionally, to leverage our strong brand equity and reduce packaging material, we are also introducing new PET ketchup bottles that are inspired by our iconic 14-ounce glass bottles. The redesigned bottles are being offered in a range of sizes, which you will see on the shelf soon. This is a very clever refresh of our flagship ketchup product that will enhance our merchandising and marketing capabilities.
The U.S. team has also begun to make progress in alternate channels like drug and dollar stores through improved distribution and more targeted product offerings aimed at value-oriented consumers. 
It's important to note that our efforts to strengthen and improve our largest and most important business are being led by a significantly upgraded management team featuring a number of new appointments. Parenthetically, I am pleased to announce that, once again, Heinz has been ranked #1 in overall customer satisfaction among food manufacturers in the 2012 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all food manufacturers for the 13th consecutive year.
Europe had a somewhat more difficult quarter than we have experienced recently. However, on a relative basis, our results compared favorably to our peers, primarily due to strength in the U.K. behind solid innovation and great results in soup and the strength of our Russian business. In short, we are holding our own in Europe despite an extremely challenging economic environment that I will discuss in a minute.
Finally, I want to comment on one other second quarter highlight. This time a year ago, we were discussing challenges faced by our U.S. Foodservice and Australian businesses. And today, I'm pleased to advise you that the actions we took over the past year have significantly improved the results from these 2 businesses.
Our second quarter results keep Heinz on track to deliver our previously announced full year outlook for sales and profit. For the full year, we expect at least 4% organic sales growth, in line with our results for the first 6 months; constant currency EPS growth of 5% to 8% on a continuing operations basis, excluding special items in fiscal 2012; and strong operating free cash flow of $1 billion-plus. As a result, we are reaffirming our constant currency EPS outlook of $3.52 to $3.62. 
But before I turn the call over to Art, I want to share my perspective on the global economy and trends in consumer behavior. Obviously, we are carefully monitoring the Eurozone crisis, like our industry peers, and we are working to assess whether the current market dislocations are of a temporary nature or systemically long term. We are seeing signs that European consumers, in general, are altering their food shopping and dining habits as the continent struggles with the debt crisis, steep unemployment and a variety of austerity and tax regimes. Like their U.S. counterparts, they are adapting to new economic realities and they have developed a strong value mindset as a result. I have challenged our European businesses to see this as an opportunity rather than a roadblock and believe we will continue to resiliently and successfully adapt to the economic trends and new consumer behavior in their markets. 
Here in the U.S., I have seen some signs of modest economic recovery and improving consumer confidence although there is still great uncertainty as the fiscal cliff looms. I don't expect robust economic growth in the U.S. in 2013, but I am encouraged by the progress in our U.S. business as we invest in our leading brands to drive growth. 
We need to remind ourselves that we sell staple products that enhance the foods that people enjoy every day, and we can successfully adapt to the new value orientation if we're a bit more flexible and nimble in our thinking. I'm still very bullish about the growth in Emerging Markets where Heinz has grown at a robust 16% rate year-to-date. Importantly, we are redeploying talent and investment behind our Emerging Market businesses and aggressively searching for new opportunities while maintaining an appropriate level of investment in our key developed markets.
To win in this challenging environment, Heinz is focusing as never before on meeting the consumers' changing needs, accelerating innovation across our brands and delivering even greater value for our customers. With strong brands and a balanced global portfolio, I believe that we are as well positioned to deliver continued growth in the global economy as anyone. The economy remains challenging to say the least.
Our strategic continues to be focused on the long-term prize of a significantly larger Emerging Markets business and global leadership in the very profitable ketchup, condiments and sauces category. Reflecting our focus on driving global growth and shareholder value, I am pleased to announce that Frank Moison, Colgate's Chief Operating Officer, Emergent Markets and South Pacific, has been appointed to the Heinz Board of Directors. As the COO responsible for Colgate's fastest-growing global markets, Frank will bring a strong international perspective, a keen understanding of global consumer trends and extensive SAP implementation experience to our board. 
In summary, our company remains focused on operating discipline, appropriate investment levels and profitable growth. And I believe we have the brands, the businesses, the talent and the strategy to enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Art, and will be back later for your Q&A."
278212,224047292,390464,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 20, 2012",2012-11-20,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EP",1431,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. 
For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EPS growth from all angles. First, on a continuing operations basis, excluding prior year special items, results increased 11% to $0.90. And excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange, EPS increased 14%. On a total company reported basis, EPS increase was even stronger, up 23%, reflecting $0.08 of onetime productivity charges in Q2 of last fiscal year. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard. Foreign exchange reduced the top and bottom line by about 2.5%. Excluding this FX impact on a constant currency x items basis, sales grew 2.9%, driven by organic sales growth of 3.3%. Importantly, all of our segments posted positive organic sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin was up 40 basis points and constant currency gross profit grew 4.1%. We continue to increase our investment in marketing and in additional capabilities. Operating income was up slightly despite the increased P&L investments. And finally, as mentioned, EPS was up nearly 14%.
As projected during last quarter's call, Q2 EPS benefited from a favorable tax rate at about 10%. This largely reflects foreign tax planning initiatives. In short, we delivered solid top and bottom line growth while a favorable tax rate enabled us to make significant investments in the business.
Looking at the key components to revenue growth. Organic sales growth of 3.3% was driven by both volume and price. Volume growth of 1.4% was led by U.S. consumer products, the U.K., Brazil, Russia and China sauces, partially offset by declines in The Netherlands and Italy. Price improvements of 1.9% were led by Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, U.S. Foodservice and Continental Europe. Now excluding the impact of the prior year decisions to exit T.G.I. frozen meals and downsize our Long Fong frozen business in China, organic sales growth was 4.1% for the quarter. And finally, our top line was unfavorably impacted by 2 prior period divestitures and by foreign exchange.
Our 40 basis point improvement in gross margin was led by the U.S. businesses along with Russia, Australia and Brazil. Market inflation on commodities was about 4% in the quarter led by tomatoes, potatoes and sweeteners. And looking forward, we expect around 4% market inflation on the balance of the year, largely in line with our original projections.
Now let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each one of our key segments. In North American Consumer Product, we are encouraged at the progress the team is making to drive profitable growth. Organic sales were up slightly as volume increased 1.2% and net price decreased 0.8% since we optimized price points on the Ore-Ida and Classico brands. Excluding the impact of selling off the Boston Market license and the exit of T.G.I. frozen meals, U.S. retail sales grew by nearly 4%, our strongest performance in 9 quarters. Importantly, gross margin was up 70 basis points, driven by strong productivity while operating income reflected a significant increase in marketing spending.
Our U.S. Foodservice business posted excellent results for the quarter with sales up more than 4% and profit up almost 27%. Net price increased about 4%, driven by pricing actions taken in the second half of last year to offset inflation. And volume was roughly flat overall, reflecting current restaurant industry traffic trends. The business posted strong gross margin and operating income growth as a result of higher sales, effective cost management and the benefit from prior year productivity initiatives. 
Across the pond, constant currency results in Europe were about flat for the quarter. Organic sales were slightly positive as double-digit growth in Russia was enough to offset the impact of a weak economy and soft category sales in Italy. U.K. volume was up despite cool weather during barbecue season, but net price was down. Importantly, market share gains were achieved in our large soup, beans and ketchup businesses. Higher gross margin was driven by productivity improvements, which outpaced net commodity inflation. And constant currency operating income was flat to prior year, driven by a higher marketing investment, partially offset by lower SG&A spending.
Asia/Pacific posted very strong results with constant currency sales up 4% and profit up almost 27%. Organic sales growth was 4.1%. Emerging Markets continue to post strong growth while our developed markets also delivered organic sales growth in the quarter. Volume was up nearly 2%, led primarily by very strong growth in sauces in China and Indonesia, partially offset by Long Fong and the timing of Ramadan. Price was up more than 2%, driven by a double-digit increase in Indonesia to cover commodity inflation. The region achieved strong gross margin growth, up 130 basis points, driven by Australia, New Zealand and China. Both emerging and developed markets posted strong double-digit operating income growth.
And as Bill noted, we're very pleased with the turnaround in Australia. Operating income grew significantly this quarter, a result of the targeted actions we took to improve commercial capabilities, simplify the business, reduce costs and focus on better day-to-day execution.
Now turning to our Rest of World segment. We posted organic and constant currency sales growth of nearly 20% with all regions delivering double-digit organic sales growth. Volume increased by 6.5% led by Brazil where we achieved strong market share growth in vegetables, ketchup and pasta sauce. Notably, Quero recently became the #1 brand of vegetables in Brazil. Mexico also achieved strong volume growth in the quarter as our ketchup and baby food businesses attained record market shares in October. And net pricing increased by 13%, led by strong pricing in South America. Gross profit dollars increased, but gross margin decreased as a result of high inflation costs in Venezuela. And operating income reflects lower profitability in Venezuela and increased investments in marketing capabilities in Brazil.
Now moving to cash. Operating free cash flow was $155 million for the quarter, up $24 million, driven by higher net income and slightly lower capital spending. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $62 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year.
Now let's take a very brief look at the results for the first half. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales are up 3.5%, operating income up almost 3% and EPS up more than 14%. For the first half, organic sales were up 4%, gross margin has increased and we've continued to invest in both marketing and capabilities.
The year-to-date tax rate is about 14% and this helped drive EPS and fund our investments in the business. 
Now looking at the balance sheet scorecard. Capital spending is flat to prior year as a percentage of revenue. Cash conversion cycle improved significantly, down 6 days to 38 days, largely driven by better inventory management. Year-to-date cash flow of $131 million is below prior year due to the timing of receivable securitization and cash taxes. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt-to-EBITDA is flat to prior year and remains low at 2.1x. And ROIC has increased nearly 200 basis points, reflecting higher net income and the benefits from last year's productivity initiatives.
Now let's switch gears and I'd like to make a couple of comments on the second half of the fiscal year. As Bill said today, we are reaffirming our original top and bottom line outlook. In the second half, we expect increased innovation and 4%-plus organic sales growth, accelerating gross margin improvements, incremental investment in global marketing, Emerging Markets sales capabilities and the SAP program and a higher effective tax rate, which is anticipated to be in the low to mid-20s during the third quarter and a bit higher in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect a rate of around 20%. EPS should be at about the same level in Q3 and Q4 this year, which is in line with our full year constant currency outlook.
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment, driving strong top line growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands, delivering higher gross margin despite the difficult market environment and making significant investments in the business enabled by a favorable tax rate.
With that, we'll turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?"

Currently, what we're seeing is very strong performance on our breakfast business, good performance in some of our sides in terms of the snacks. And our base entrée business, we are not promoting as aggressively as maybe we could and that's a decision we've made. And so the focus has really been in frozen on getting Ore-Ida and our snacks business growing, which we did very successfully in the second quarter. So generally, Smart Ones was not as strong in the second quarter as I think we would have liked. We'll see how the season plays out. But my bigger issue, Alexia, continues to be the nutritional category where the industry has lost about 1/3 of its sales over the last 5 years. And so rather than chasing volume in a category that's still not sure where it's going, we're planning on innovation.

In other markets, I think we need to do a better job of getting a more prominent distribution. But generally, it's playing in line in most markets with where we thought it would be and the Hispanic market's doing much better. I think outside the U.S., DOYPACK continues to be an incredible boon to the business. In Indonesia, it's -- majority of our growth is coming in condiments and sauces, which is being led by DOYPACK; same thing in Russia. The launch in Mexico has been nothing more than a heroic success. In fact, we can't supply baby food in Mexico. We've just started up another line in Guadalajara, but we are literally out of stock. We launched 3 SKUs in baby food last year. We're now up to 5, soon to be 7 or 8. Our share is now in double digits. And the same thing on ketchup where we're now close to a 20 share in Mexico from 0, 3 or 4 years ago. And again, most of that is being driven by DOYPACK. We've launched it in the U.K. So DOYPACK is going to be a clear component of the company's success going forward, particularly given the price point. And in the U.S., I'm pleased with where we are in the Hispanic markets and I think we'll see more upside going forward from DOYPACK.

So the U.S. business is responding to the marketing, which is, frankly, a balance of promotion and media and traditional marketing support. And I think we feel pretty good about where we're headed from a volume standpoint once we get the noise of T.G.I.F. behind us and we do have to address the Smart Ones question that was raised earlier. I think from a profit standpoint, I would be very pleased this year with the U.S. company coming in plus or minus a few points versus last year. It will just depend on how much investment we make in the second half. We had a significant increase, and I want to underline the word significant in the second quarter. We don't break out marketing spending by business unit for a lot of obvious reasons. But it is not unreasonable to say marketing spending in the U.S. was up well into the double digits in the second quarter, the bulk of that behind ketchup and the Hispanic advertising and some advertising in the Southeast and Ore-Ida in addition to some stuff we have done on Classico and frankly on snacks. So I think I feel better about the prospects of the U.S. going forward from a top line standpoint and a share standpoint. The most recent share, as I said, 65% volume growth in my comments. But in the last 4 weeks, volume share growth was almost 78% of the total business, so we are seeing a response. But there's no doubt that we are intentionally pressuring profits in the U.S. this year as we work to restore the top line growth. Fortunately, we're able to do that not only because of the tax rate, but because of the strength of the Foodservice business and the strength of our Emerging Markets businesses in terms of growing the bottom line. So I think one of the benefits of running a portfolio company like we do is it gives us an enormous amount of flexibility in terms of where we reprioritize investment. And so I think you'll see significant investment increases in the U.S. as we continue to drive the top line."

And then we've got some interesting things over the longer term that you'll see over the next 6 to 12 months in Smart Ones. I certainly don't want to imply that we're walking away from the business because we're not. It's critically important to us. But I think you can read into that, that the dollars we're allocating for investment in the freezer case we're going to put first where we're getting our best return, which, in this case right now, is Ore-Ida and snacks and we'll manage the Smart Ones business the best way we can.

That's one of the reasons you saw the margin improve in the quarter because our investments behind our leading margin brands, which would be ketchup and Ore-Ida, gave us a good response in the quarter and I think so we're going to continue to balance it. And I've been very pleased with the turnaround in Ore-Ida. I continue to believe ketchup is still an opportunity in the U.S. I think the new package launch in the U.S. behind something we have an internal name for that basically leads to transforming the ketchup category is something that we're very excited about. We've launched 38- and 34-ounce sizes, and in specialty items in 14-ounce sizes the consumer response in research has been extraordinary. The Hispanic response in terms of where we are with our marketing efforts has been great. So what we're doing is we're choosing and prioritizing against where we think the greatest leverage is to the P&L and to the top line. And so yes, I mean, it's not necessarily an issue of triage, but it is going to be an issue who's going to give me the best return for incremental dollars."

Virtually every other business in the Rest of the World segment grew margin, including Brazil, which grew their margin significantly. It was an issue of Venezuela. And part of the issue in Venezuela relates to the timing of the elections and the trade backing off in terms of buying product and the inflation rate, which we have not been able to price up to in the Venezuelan market. So I think if you back Venezuela out of the Rest of the World, you'll see a dramatically different margin growth story, particularly in Brazil where I was very pleased; we grew margins 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter in Brazil. I think the second thing that you need to keep in mind is we are coming off in the Rest of the World an incredible quarter last year. We are up 150 basis point slam and a 150% last year on operating profit. And so we knew Rest of World from a bottom line standpoint was not going to have the kind of quarter we had last year. But I have to tell you the Brazilian business has been nothing more than a continued surprise to me in terms of how well it is doing. We're seeing continued growth in Mexico, great performance in the rest of Latin America x Venezuela and really strong results coming out of the Middle East. And so I feel pretty good about where we are. But Venezuela is the story of the Rest of World in the second quarter in terms of the dilution on margin. And that will address itself over time as they finish the elections in December on a state basis and then we get some clarity on what's going to happen going forward."

And I will tell you some of that marketing may be deployed a little differently in the second half of the year. We may put some back in promotion depending on the market and depending on where we are. But we are still on track for the investments, significant investments, and boots on the ground in the Emerging Markets. And it's really interesting, if you look at the 3 markets that benefited the most, China condiments and sauces, Russia and Brazil and so those are our 3 best-performing Emerging Market businesses along with Indonesia during the second quarter and through the first half of the year. I mean, Russia sales organically were up around 14%. Obviously, condiments and sauces that you saw in China up around 20% and Brazil up around 33%. So we're seeing a very good response from that. We've made significant investments in SAP, particularly in Canada and now in Europe. We've just turned Spain on following the success in Germany. So we continue to roll out those investments. Marketing spend, as I said, on a constant currency basis, is up 8% to 10% so far this year, very strong in the second quarter. So we're about where we thought we would be, David. I think the qualification I'll give you is in the second half, if we see better leverage on the promotions side that's where we'll go. Now having said that, I want to be clear that promotion spending as defined by deal spending for the company is not up year-on-year through the first half of the year. I won't be any more specific than that for a lot of reasons, but we are not up. So the opportunity to deploy differently will be predicated on the category, the country, the business and where the opportunities are. But we're still tracking for a double-digit increase in marketing spending on the year on a constant currency basis, which is how we defined it in May, and through a substantial improvement in capabilities around the company and we're seeing really good returns on that. Even SAP in Europe, we're starting to see a very positive response from the investments into Benelux a couple of years ago. Spain has gone in extremely well. Germany has gone in well and it allowed us to consolidate the German business into the rest of Continental Europe when we sold the Sonnen business earlier this year. So our plans have not changed. The prioritization of how those dollars are allocated may be modified a bit in the second half."

And so I think in that context, Rob, I don't want to be any more enlightened or enlightening in terms of how we're going to do that. The other thing you got to remember, I mean we're dealing with the world right now that we can't figure out. I mean, the turmoil in the world. You tell me how the fiscal cliff is going to be resolved. You tell me how Europe is going to be resolved. You tell me what's going to happen to currency in the second half of the year. You tell me what's going to happen to consumer confidence. And so right now we're sort of sitting pat until we get a better sense certainly as we approach the end of this calendar year and into the beginning of next calendar year how all this stuff unfolds. I mean right now in Europe you're dealing with various austerity and tax regimes that aren't working very well and the efficacy of those is being challenged. We've got consumer unhappiness throughout the European continent, but particularly in Southern Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula. We're seeing similar things happening in the U.S. as foodservice traffic now sort of reflects the anticipation of what's going to happen with the cliff. I don't share the confidence in our political process that others seem to be believing in. And so I think from our standpoint, we're just sitting until we know where we are. The other thing I will tell you, tax is never a certainty. While we feel pretty good about where we are, things happen and so I think we just want to keep where we are going and work from that. I'm pleased with the execution of the company. I'm pleased with where we're headed. I think Emerging Markets continue to look very promising. And if anything, I will continue to invest in more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets before I probably put more into specific marketing. I mean, the boots on the ground is giving us a very solid tangible return in all these markets. I'd like to see us do a little bit more in Indonesia and maybe a little bit more in India.

And now here, it's notable the first quarter, I believe, in a while where you've had a negative price mix in those, so you were moderating pricing, you've seen sequential improvement in volumes. So I wonder if -- it seems like broadly in the food industry now, consumers have reacted to brands lowering price by improving volume. That's what the data is telling us and is there -- do you expect a period where you're going to invest in price a little bit more to drive more volume? I know you've called out some categories that you don't think are worth it, but do you intend to keep that going and accelerate volume through?

But I think a lot of what we're doing is being driven by mix and the way the sizing, the price points in terms of smaller sizes and in terms of different kinds of recipes and so forth, Jonathan. But yes, I mean I think, as I said a few minutes ago, in response to David's question about marketing spend in the second half, if we believe we can generate a better return by leveraging more promotion as opposed to just generalized traditional marketing, that's the way we will go. But it will depend on the business. In ketchup right now in the U.S., we're getting a great response from very traditional advertising as we are in Ore-Ida after balancing where we needed to be on price. In the Emerging Markets, we're getting very good price and the thing you got to remember in those markets is you have general inflation, which is also being reflected in wages and so forth. So the consumer is not as put off by price and private label is not a big issue. But I think, generally, even in the developed world, private label's no longer showing the kind of growth they did and it's really going to be a function of creating value in the mind of the consumer whether that value manifests itself in terms of better innovation, premium product, superior performance or a combination of promoted volume and/or better price points. It's just going to depend on the category and on where we think we're getting the best return. And clearly, in some of these businesses, price is going to be a better lever than other businesses. Clearly, in other cases, marketing's going to be the better lever and what we're trying to do is evaluate on elasticity basis exactly where we get the greatest leverage."

We also have SAP investment coming in the second half of the year. And obviously, the finalization of the Innovation Center in Europe. So there's a fair amount of capital investment established in the second half the year. Frankly, my perspective is the lower I can keep that number, the happier I am as everybody who works for me knows. The reality is given the pressure we have on volume in the Emerging Markets, we have to provide capacity. As I said, we put a new pouch line into Mexico, we have a second one coming very shortly. We have a new pouch line going into Brazil. We're going to have a second one of those coming very shortly. We've got -- we are starting to produce ketchup in Brazil in the next 30 or 40 days. I think you've also got a fair amount of activity in the Asian markets, China, in particular, is an area we're going to have to continue to invest in, but -- so I think we'll be right around that number. To be honest with you, if I had my druthers, I'd try to bring it down. But right now given the SAP implementation and capacity needs I have in the business, I can't. The final thing is we're pretty much out of capacity on Dip & Squeeze. We're going to look at a fourth line on Dip & Squeeze. Where that line goes is yet to be determined. It'll be interesting to see where that line goes. I think you should not assume that line is automatically going into the U.S. but that is a line that we will have to start talking about in the second half of the year because we're out of capacity and the Emerging Markets are all yelling and screaming at me for Dip & Squeeze capabilities.

Secondly, innovation in the U.K. is up 50% year-on-year in the second half. We have a significant amount of innovation in the Emerging Markets, particularly behind pouch initiatives. We've got a significant amount of innovation coming in the U.S., more of which I'll detail at CAGNY. We have a lot of activity in other parts of Europe as well, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. So there's a significant amount of new product activity in the second half of the year and a significant response to the marketing spending that we've initiated in the first half the year, much of which really didn't begin until the second quarter and you'll see a follow-through in the third quarter. So I think in that context, I feel reasonably sanguine. Let me underline those 2 words, reasonably sanguine, about strong volume growth or strong organic sales growth in the second half of the year. The Emerging Markets, as I said, last year at this time, relative to the second half, should be much stronger in the second half of this year than they were in the first half of this year. We're seeing huge pickup in Brazil. Hopefully, the new ketchup line will be ready. We've launched Heinz tomato paste. It's doing very well. The enabling lines we've now put in Mexico will allow us to start shipping baby food more aggressively. What we're doing in Indonesia with the launches in the second half, which are all predominantly condiments and sauces launches; a lot of activity in terms of our expansion of our food -- of our condiments and sauces business in China, as well as some food service initiatives; and the focus on ketchup, the continued strength of ketchup in the European continent; and then just the general success of Russia should help us drive volume in the second half of the year. I feel pretty good about the third quarter. The fourth quarter is really where we're going to have the big measurement year-on-year. But the forecasts coming in from our operating teams are all pretty optimistic about volume growth. There is organic sales growth in the second half of the year. So right now we see no reason to back off that. And I'll remind you, we have generated about 4% through the first half this year and that's without the benefit of some of the marketing that you'll see in the second half."

We have a number of very close-in initiatives underway in the 3 markets I mentioned in my initial comments as well as other markets where I think we need to improve our footprint. For perspective, I just came back from a 15-day around-the-world trip where I was in various parts of Asia and various parts of Europe, and we are aggressively looking at and aggressively in the process of M&A activity. And yes, I will be very, very disappointed if we're not 30% before fiscal '16. I really will. And there's no guarantee obviously. People really don't care about my level of disappointment.

It wasn't much because we're just now in the process of getting it on the shelf, certainly in Dollar General and some of the other stores. Pharmacy is coming along quite well. We're still grossly underdeveloped in both channels. So I would say it's more a second half story than it is a first half story. And to be honest with you, I don't have any idea how much it was in the second quarter. I don't think it was very significant based on what I'm hearing from the operating team. So I think it's still going to be a second half and fiscal '14 story for the company. But we're so far behind where many of our peers are that it's still a big opportunity. And in terms of volume going forward, I mean, clearly -- and I assume you're talking the U.S. but if you're not, please let me know, I feel reasonably -- again, reasonably good about the activities we have in the second half of the year. I think the management team in the U.S. has done an excellent job on refocusing on innovation. I was at the Innovation Center in North America a week ago Friday and spent the whole afternoon with them reviewing a litany of the new product initiatives underway and some of the activities that will start hitting the market late in this fiscal year, which will add some benefit in Q4, but really should have the bulk of their benefit next year beyond pipeline fill. So again, a lot of -- excuse me, a lot of activity in potatoes, a lot of activity in sauces and a lot of activity in some other areas that I think will be interesting. If you look at our business, the strongest category growth in any of our businesses in developed markets is vinegar and barbecue sauce, and the U.S. Vinegar is growing as a category at a double-digit rate, as are we, and so we're going to leverage that and look for opportunities there as well. So again, I think there's some opportunities in the second half of the year to drive better volume than we did in the first half in the U.S. company."

The Republicans want to keep it at 15 points plus a 3.8%. So I think there's likely to be some kind of compromise on dividend tax. Secondly, most of our investors, Eric, are still telling us they'd prefer to see it in the form of dividends and share buybacks. And so our strategy continues to be, in terms of the deployment of cash, M&A, and as I said we have an aggressive pipeline full of M&A. A lot of initiatives underway, several of which I hope would get done sooner rather than later, but we'll see. As you know that's a tricky game. And then the second use would be cash and then obviously we'll continue to buy back stock in order to prevent dilution from outstanding shares. But right now we don't see a change. I don't know how the fiscal cliff is going to manifest itself, how it's going to manage out. Obviously, if we start hearing from our investors and we start seeing a dramatic shift, then we'll be flexible in terms of what's going to create the most value. It's just right now our belief is based on what we're hearing that dividends are still the best way for us to deploy cash back to our investors. That may change. And if it does, then obviously we'll modify our approach but right now that's where we are."

278212,224047292,390822,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 20, 2012",2012-11-20,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Meg, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. Starting with the second quarter. Heinz delivered EPS of $0.90",1698,"Thank you, Meg, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the company's full year outlook and my perspective on the global environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. Heinz delivered EPS of $0.90 from continuing operations with organic sales growth of between 3% and 4%, our 30th consecutive quarter of organic top line growth. These results reflect a nice balance between volume and pricing and strength in our 3 engines of growth: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Second quarter earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate that we leveraged to significantly increase investment in marketing and global capabilities to drive further growth. Importantly, we increased marketing spend by over 13% in the quarter on a constant currency basis with a particularly large increase in North America where I am encouraged by our recent momentum. We also continue to ramp up investments behind enhanced Emerging Markets capabilities and our global SAP implementation. 
Consistent with our efforts to improve global capabilities and enhanced innovation, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the completion of our European Innovation and Quality Center in The Netherlands, which will open shortly. 
Our business results, as I said a moment ago, were again led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands. Emerging Markets delivered organic sales growth of more than 13% and would have been up well over 14% were it not for the impact of the planned Long Fong downsizing. Global Ketchup grew 5%. And our Top 15 Brands grew almost 5% despite the exit from T.G.I.F. meals, which reduced organic sales by about 90 basis points. 
Emerging market results were led by Brazil, reflecting the strength of the Quero brand of tomatoes sauces, ketchup and vegetables and the launch of Heinz tomato paste in China behind the success of Foodstar. These 2 recently acquired businesses have performed well beyond our initial expectations and both appear to have considerable upside. Indonesia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East also grew quite strongly in the quarter. 
Taking a closer look at Brazil and China. Brazil delivered organic sales growth of 33% in the quarter with improved value shares in a number of categories, including ketchup, pasta sauces and vegetables. Importantly, we have commenced manufacturing Heinz tomato paste in Brazil and will begin producing Heinz Ketchup locally next month to accelerate its distribution and availability. 
In China, our ketchup, condiments and sauces business delivered strong organic growth of around 20%, driven by the momentum of our Master, Long Fong and Heinz brands. Our China sauce strategy is focused on these 3 core brands with significant growth potential as we continue to expand across the country. This will be enhanced upon the completion of the Shanghai factory, which will increase our soy sauce bottling capacity in China by nearly 2/3 to support continued growth in the world's largest soy sauce market. 
Overall, Emerging Markets generated 23% of the company's sales in the quarter. And given our success in Brazil, Russia and China, in particular, we are aggressively evaluating both organic and M&A growth initiatives in these markets.
Our second growth engine, Global Ketchup, also performed well in the quarter led by solid sales increases in the U.S., Brazil and Russia. We still have considerable opportunity in ketchup, condiments and sauces, which, as a category, is now approaching 50% of total Heinz sales. We are focused on driving usage and share in our core KC&S business in developed markets while simultaneously introducing millions of new middle class consumers in emerging markets to Heinz Ketchup and our core soy sauce brands. Marketing and M&A initiatives are being increasingly directed against a large opportunity in condiments and sauces where we have proven that we have a clear right to win. 
And finally, our Top 15 Brands delivered strong organic sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter, led by Heinz, Quero and ABC despite the aforementioned exit from T.G.I.F. meals. Notably, we have seen improvement in our U.S. business with around 65% of our consumer products portfolio now growing volume share. The share improvement reflects increased brand investment and better execution. As promised, we are taking significant action to return the U.S. to profitable growth and we'll continue to do so. We have made progress on Ore-Ida and Classico where we have addressed the value propositions while increasing marketing and innovation behind both brands.
We are taking similar action to drive Heinz Ketchup growth in the U.S. and I'm pleased with the response to our outreach in the Hispanic community where we are building penetration and trail through multilingual advertising and more affordable packaging like the $0.99 pouch. 
We continue to build excitement around our flagship product with new varieties like Balsamic Ketchup and Jalapeño Ketchup, which we are launching on Cyber Monday through a Facebook campaign. 
Additionally, to leverage our strong brand equity and reduce packaging material, we are also introducing new PET ketchup bottles that are inspired by our iconic 14-ounce glass bottles. The redesigned bottles are being offered in a range of sizes, which you will see on the shelf soon. This is a very clever refresh of our flagship ketchup product that will enhance our merchandising and marketing capabilities.
The U.S. team has also begun to make progress in alternate channels like drug and dollar stores through improved distribution and more targeted product offerings aimed at value-oriented consumers. 
It's important to note that our efforts to strengthen and improve our largest and most important business are being led by a significantly upgraded management team featuring a number of new appointments. Parenthetically, I am pleased to announce that, once again, Heinz has been ranked #1 in overall customer satisfaction among food manufacturers in the 2012 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all food manufacturers for the 13th consecutive year.
Europe had a somewhat more difficult quarter than we have experienced recently. However, on a relative basis, our results compared favorably to our peers, primarily due to strength in the U.K. behind solid innovation and great results in soup and the strength of our Russian business. In short, we are holding our own in Europe despite an extremely challenging economic environment that I will discuss in a minute.
Finally, I want to comment on one other second quarter highlight. This time a year ago, we were discussing challenges faced by our U.S. Foodservice and Australian businesses. And today, I'm pleased to advise you that the actions we took over the past year have significantly improved the results from these 2 businesses.
Our second quarter results keep Heinz on track to deliver our previously announced full year outlook for sales and profit. For the full year, we expect at least 4% organic sales growth, in line with our results for the first 6 months; constant currency EPS growth of 5% to 8% on a continuing operations basis, excluding special items in fiscal 2012; and strong operating free cash flow of $1 billion-plus. As a result, we are reaffirming our constant currency EPS outlook of $3.52 to $3.62. 
But before I turn the call over to Art, I want to share my perspective on the global economy and trends in consumer behavior. Obviously, we are carefully monitoring the Eurozone crisis, like our industry peers, and we are working to assess whether the current market dislocations are of a temporary nature or systemically long term. We are seeing signs that European consumers, in general, are altering their food shopping and dining habits as the continent struggles with the debt crisis, steep unemployment and a variety of austerity and tax regimes. Like their U.S. counterparts, they are adapting to new economic realities and they have developed a strong value mindset as a result. I have challenged our European businesses to see this as an opportunity rather than a roadblock and believe we will continue to resiliently and successfully adapt to the economic trends and new consumer behavior in their markets. 
Here in the U.S., I have seen some signs of modest economic recovery and improving consumer confidence although there is still great uncertainty as the fiscal cliff looms. I don't expect robust economic growth in the U.S. in 2013, but I am encouraged by the progress in our U.S. business as we invest in our leading brands to drive growth. 
We need to remind ourselves that we sell staple products that enhance the foods that people enjoy every day, and we can successfully adapt to the new value orientation if we're a bit more flexible and nimble in our thinking. I'm still very bullish about the growth in Emerging Markets where Heinz has grown at a robust 16% rate year-to-date. Importantly, we are redeploying talent and investment behind our Emerging Market businesses and aggressively searching for new opportunities while maintaining an appropriate level of investment in our key developed markets.
To win in this challenging environment, Heinz is focusing as never before on meeting the consumers' changing needs, accelerating innovation across our brands and delivering even greater value for our customers. With strong brands and a balanced global portfolio, I believe that we are as well positioned to deliver continued growth in the global economy as anyone. The economy remains challenging to say the least.
Our strategic continues to be focused on the long-term prize of a significantly larger Emerging Markets business and global leadership in the very profitable ketchup, condiments and sauces category. Reflecting our focus on driving global growth and shareholder value, I am pleased to announce that Frank Moison, Colgate's Chief Operating Officer, Emergent Markets and South Pacific, has been appointed to the Heinz Board of Directors. As the COO responsible for Colgate's fastest-growing global markets, Frank will bring a strong international perspective, a keen understanding of global consumer trends and extensive SAP implementation experience to our board. 
In summary, our company remains focused on operating discipline, appropriate investment levels and profitable growth. And I believe we have the brands, the businesses, the talent and the strategy to enhance shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Art, and will be back later for your Q&A."
278212,224047292,390822,"H. J. Heinz Company, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 20, 2012",2012-11-20,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EP",1431,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update on the first half and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year. 
For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EPS growth from all angles. First, on a continuing operations basis, excluding prior year special items, results increased 11% to $0.90. And excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange, EPS increased 14%. On a total company reported basis, EPS increase was even stronger, up 23%, reflecting $0.08 of onetime productivity charges in Q2 of last fiscal year. 
Turning to the P&L scorecard. Foreign exchange reduced the top and bottom line by about 2.5%. Excluding this FX impact on a constant currency x items basis, sales grew 2.9%, driven by organic sales growth of 3.3%. Importantly, all of our segments posted positive organic sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin was up 40 basis points and constant currency gross profit grew 4.1%. We continue to increase our investment in marketing and in additional capabilities. Operating income was up slightly despite the increased P&L investments. And finally, as mentioned, EPS was up nearly 14%.
As projected during last quarter's call, Q2 EPS benefited from a favorable tax rate at about 10%. This largely reflects foreign tax planning initiatives. In short, we delivered solid top and bottom line growth while a favorable tax rate enabled us to make significant investments in the business.
Looking at the key components to revenue growth. Organic sales growth of 3.3% was driven by both volume and price. Volume growth of 1.4% was led by U.S. consumer products, the U.K., Brazil, Russia and China sauces, partially offset by declines in The Netherlands and Italy. Price improvements of 1.9% were led by Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, U.S. Foodservice and Continental Europe. Now excluding the impact of the prior year decisions to exit T.G.I. frozen meals and downsize our Long Fong frozen business in China, organic sales growth was 4.1% for the quarter. And finally, our top line was unfavorably impacted by 2 prior period divestitures and by foreign exchange.
Our 40 basis point improvement in gross margin was led by the U.S. businesses along with Russia, Australia and Brazil. Market inflation on commodities was about 4% in the quarter led by tomatoes, potatoes and sweeteners. And looking forward, we expect around 4% market inflation on the balance of the year, largely in line with our original projections.
Now let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each one of our key segments. In North American Consumer Product, we are encouraged at the progress the team is making to drive profitable growth. Organic sales were up slightly as volume increased 1.2% and net price decreased 0.8% since we optimized price points on the Ore-Ida and Classico brands. Excluding the impact of selling off the Boston Market license and the exit of T.G.I. frozen meals, U.S. retail sales grew by nearly 4%, our strongest performance in 9 quarters. Importantly, gross margin was up 70 basis points, driven by strong productivity while operating income reflected a significant increase in marketing spending.
Our U.S. Foodservice business posted excellent results for the quarter with sales up more than 4% and profit up almost 27%. Net price increased about 4%, driven by pricing actions taken in the second half of last year to offset inflation. And volume was roughly flat overall, reflecting current restaurant industry traffic trends. The business posted strong gross margin and operating income growth as a result of higher sales, effective cost management and the benefit from prior year productivity initiatives. 
Across the pond, constant currency results in Europe were about flat for the quarter. Organic sales were slightly positive as double-digit growth in Russia was enough to offset the impact of a weak economy and soft category sales in Italy. U.K. volume was up despite cool weather during barbecue season, but net price was down. Importantly, market share gains were achieved in our large soup, beans and ketchup businesses. Higher gross margin was driven by productivity improvements, which outpaced net commodity inflation. And constant currency operating income was flat to prior year, driven by a higher marketing investment, partially offset by lower SG&A spending.
Asia/Pacific posted very strong results with constant currency sales up 4% and profit up almost 27%. Organic sales growth was 4.1%. Emerging Markets continue to post strong growth while our developed markets also delivered organic sales growth in the quarter. Volume was up nearly 2%, led primarily by very strong growth in sauces in China and Indonesia, partially offset by Long Fong and the timing of Ramadan. Price was up more than 2%, driven by a double-digit increase in Indonesia to cover commodity inflation. The region achieved strong gross margin growth, up 130 basis points, driven by Australia, New Zealand and China. Both emerging and developed markets posted strong double-digit operating income growth.
And as Bill noted, we're very pleased with the turnaround in Australia. Operating income grew significantly this quarter, a result of the targeted actions we took to improve commercial capabilities, simplify the business, reduce costs and focus on better day-to-day execution.
Now turning to our Rest of World segment. We posted organic and constant currency sales growth of nearly 20% with all regions delivering double-digit organic sales growth. Volume increased by 6.5% led by Brazil where we achieved strong market share growth in vegetables, ketchup and pasta sauce. Notably, Quero recently became the #1 brand of vegetables in Brazil. Mexico also achieved strong volume growth in the quarter as our ketchup and baby food businesses attained record market shares in October. And net pricing increased by 13%, led by strong pricing in South America. Gross profit dollars increased, but gross margin decreased as a result of high inflation costs in Venezuela. And operating income reflects lower profitability in Venezuela and increased investments in marketing capabilities in Brazil.
Now moving to cash. Operating free cash flow was $155 million for the quarter, up $24 million, driven by higher net income and slightly lower capital spending. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $62 million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the year.
Now let's take a very brief look at the results for the first half. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales are up 3.5%, operating income up almost 3% and EPS up more than 14%. For the first half, organic sales were up 4%, gross margin has increased and we've continued to invest in both marketing and capabilities.
The year-to-date tax rate is about 14% and this helped drive EPS and fund our investments in the business. 
Now looking at the balance sheet scorecard. Capital spending is flat to prior year as a percentage of revenue. Cash conversion cycle improved significantly, down 6 days to 38 days, largely driven by better inventory management. Year-to-date cash flow of $131 million is below prior year due to the timing of receivable securitization and cash taxes. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year, consistent with our typical annual phasing. Net debt-to-EBITDA is flat to prior year and remains low at 2.1x. And ROIC has increased nearly 200 basis points, reflecting higher net income and the benefits from last year's productivity initiatives.
Now let's switch gears and I'd like to make a couple of comments on the second half of the fiscal year. As Bill said today, we are reaffirming our original top and bottom line outlook. In the second half, we expect increased innovation and 4%-plus organic sales growth, accelerating gross margin improvements, incremental investment in global marketing, Emerging Markets sales capabilities and the SAP program and a higher effective tax rate, which is anticipated to be in the low to mid-20s during the third quarter and a bit higher in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect a rate of around 20%. EPS should be at about the same level in Q3 and Q4 this year, which is in line with our full year constant currency outlook.
So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment, driving strong top line growth in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands, delivering higher gross margin despite the difficult market environment and making significant investments in the business enabled by a favorable tax rate.
With that, we'll turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?"

Currently, what we're seeing is very strong performance on our breakfast business, good performance in some of our sides in terms of the snacks. And our base entrée business, we are not promoting as aggressively as maybe we could and that's a decision we've made. And so the focus has really been in frozen on getting Ore-Ida and our snacks business growing, which we did very successfully in the second quarter. So generally, Smart Ones was not as strong in the second quarter as I think we would have liked. We'll see how the season plays out. But my bigger issue, Alexia, continues to be the nutritional category where the industry has lost about 1/3 of its sales over the last 5 years. And so rather than chasing volume in a category that's still not sure where it's going, we're planning on innovation.

And so I would say it's been a key component of our success in this market. It's moved into the top 10 SKUs that we sell in those areas. In other markets, I think we need to do a better job of getting a more prominent distribution. But generally, it's playing in line in most markets with where we thought it would be and the Hispanic market's doing much better. I think outside the U.S., DOYPACK continues to be an incredible boon to the business. In Indonesia, it's -- majority of our growth is coming in condiments and sauces, which is being led by DOYPACK; same thing in Russia. The launch in Mexico has been nothing more than a heroic success. In fact, we can't supply baby food in Mexico. We've just started up another line in Guadalajara, but we are literally out of stock. We launched 3 SKUs in baby food last year. We're now up to 5, soon to be 7 or 8. Our share is now in double digits. And the same thing on ketchup where we're now close to a 20 share in Mexico from 0, 3 or 4 years ago. And again, most of that is being driven by DOYPACK. We've launched it in the U.K. So DOYPACK is going to be a clear component of the company's success going forward, particularly given the price point. And in the U.S., I'm pleased with where we are in the Hispanic markets and I think we'll see more upside going forward from DOYPACK. And I think the other thing you can count on is a lot more DOYPACK initiatives around the company, both in developed and emerging markets, going beyond just ketchup."

So the U.S. business is responding to the marketing, which is, frankly, a balance of promotion and media and traditional marketing support. And I think we feel pretty good about where we're headed from a volume standpoint once we get the noise of T.G.I.F. behind us and we do have to address the Smart Ones question that was raised earlier. I think from a profit standpoint, I would be very pleased this year with the U.S. company coming in plus or minus a few points versus last year. It will just depend on how much investment we make in the second half. We had a significant increase, and I want to underline the word significant in the second quarter. We don't break out marketing spending by business unit for a lot of obvious reasons. But it is not unreasonable to say marketing spending in the U.S. was up well into the double digits in the second quarter, the bulk of that behind ketchup and the Hispanic advertising and some advertising in the Southeast and Ore-Ida in addition to some stuff we have done on Classico and frankly on snacks. So I think I feel better about the prospects of the U.S. going forward from a top line standpoint and a share standpoint. The most recent share, as I said, 65% volume growth in my comments. But in the last 4 weeks, volume share growth was almost 78% of the total business, so we are seeing a response. But there's no doubt that we are intentionally pressuring profits in the U.S. this year as we work to restore the top line growth. Fortunately, we're able to do that not only because of the tax rate, but because of the strength of the Foodservice business and the strength of our Emerging Markets businesses in terms of growing the bottom line. So I think one of the benefits of running a portfolio company like we do is it gives us an enormous amount of flexibility in terms of where we reprioritize investment. And so I think you'll see significant investment increases in the U.S. as we continue to drive the top line."

And so as a consequence of that, we'll put the investments behind where we're seeing the growth. If I put a lot of investment behind Smart Ones and I'm chasing a declining market, there's just not going to be the return I want. So as I said, breakfast is doing well. You continue to see us focus on breakfast. We've got a lot of new activity coming during the season in terms of innovation and some new products. And then we've got some interesting things over the longer term that you'll see over the next 6 to 12 months in Smart Ones. I certainly don't want to imply that we're walking away from the business because we're not. It's critically important to us. But I think you can read into that, that the dollars we're allocating for investment in the freezer case we're going to put first where we're getting our best return, which, in this case right now, is Ore-Ida and snacks and we'll manage the Smart Ones business the best way we can.

I continue to believe ketchup is still an opportunity in the U.S. I think the new package launch in the U.S. behind something we have an internal name for that basically leads to transforming the ketchup category is something that we're very excited about. We've launched 38- and 34-ounce sizes, and in specialty items in 14-ounce sizes the consumer response in research has been extraordinary. The Hispanic response in terms of where we are with our marketing efforts has been great. So what we're doing is we're choosing and prioritizing against where we think the greatest leverage is to the P&L and to the top line.

So I think if you back Venezuela out of the Rest of the World, you'll see a dramatically different margin growth story, particularly in Brazil where I was very pleased; we grew margins 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter in Brazil. I think the second thing that you need to keep in mind is we are coming off in the Rest of the World an incredible quarter last year. We are up 150 basis point slam and a 150% last year on operating profit. And so we knew Rest of World from a bottom line standpoint was not going to have the kind of quarter we had last year. But I have to tell you the Brazilian business has been nothing more than a continued surprise to me in terms of how well it is doing. We're seeing continued growth in Mexico, great performance in the rest of Latin America x Venezuela and really strong results coming out of the Middle East. And so I feel pretty good about where we are. But Venezuela is the story of the Rest of World in the second quarter in terms of the dilution on margin.

And it's really interesting, if you look at the 3 markets that benefited the most, China condiments and sauces, Russia and Brazil and so those are our 3 best-performing Emerging Market businesses along with Indonesia during the second quarter and through the first half of the year. I mean, Russia sales organically were up around 14%. Obviously, condiments and sauces that you saw in China up around 20% and Brazil up around 33%. So we're seeing a very good response from that. We've made significant investments in SAP, particularly in Canada and now in Europe. We've just turned Spain on following the success in Germany. So we continue to roll out those investments. Marketing spend, as I said, on a constant currency basis, is up 8% to 10% so far this year, very strong in the second quarter. So we're about where we thought we would be, David. I think the qualification I'll give you is in the second half, if we see better leverage on the promotions side that's where we'll go. Now having said that, I want to be clear that promotion spending as defined by deal spending for the company is not up year-on-year through the first half of the year. I won't be any more specific than that for a lot of reasons, but we are not up. So the opportunity to deploy differently will be predicated on the category, the country, the business and where the opportunities are. But we're still tracking for a double-digit increase in marketing spending on the year on a constant currency basis, which is how we defined it in May, and through a substantial improvement in capabilities around the company and we're seeing really good returns on that. Even SAP in Europe, we're starting to see a very positive response from the investments into Benelux a couple of years ago. Spain has gone in extremely well. Germany has gone in well and it allowed us to consolidate the German business into the rest of Continental Europe when we sold the Sonnen business earlier this year. So our plans have not changed. The prioritization of how those dollars are allocated may be modified a bit in the second half."

And so I think in that context, Rob, I don't want to be any more enlightened or enlightening in terms of how we're going to do that. The other thing you got to remember, I mean we're dealing with the world right now that we can't figure out. I mean, the turmoil in the world. You tell me how the fiscal cliff is going to be resolved. You tell me how Europe is going to be resolved. You tell me what's going to happen to currency in the second half of the year. You tell me what's going to happen to consumer confidence. And so right now we're sort of sitting pat until we get a better sense certainly as we approach the end of this calendar year and into the beginning of next calendar year how all this stuff unfolds. I mean right now in Europe you're dealing with various austerity and tax regimes that aren't working very well and the efficacy of those is being challenged. We've got consumer unhappiness throughout the European continent, but particularly in Southern Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula. We're seeing similar things happening in the U.S. as foodservice traffic now sort of reflects the anticipation of what's going to happen with the cliff. I don't share the confidence in our political process that others seem to be believing in. And so I think from our standpoint, we're just sitting until we know where we are. The other thing I will tell you, tax is never a certainty. While we feel pretty good about where we are, things happen and so I think we just want to keep where we are going and work from that. I'm pleased with the execution of the company. I'm pleased with where we're headed. I think Emerging Markets continue to look very promising. And if anything, I will continue to invest in more boots on the ground in Emerging Markets before I probably put more into specific marketing. I mean, the boots on the ground is giving us a very solid tangible return in all these markets. I'd like to see us do a little bit more in Indonesia and maybe a little bit more in India. And then we have a lot of other initiatives in place."

When I look over the past 4 years, it's been -- did you see some significant volume declines across basically Europe, certainly Foodservice, and North America. And now here, it's notable the first quarter, I believe, in a while where you've had a negative price mix in those, so you were moderating pricing, you've seen sequential improvement in volumes. So I wonder if -- it seems like broadly in the food industry now, consumers have reacted to brands lowering price by improving volume. That's what the data is telling us and is there -- do you expect a period where you're going to invest in price a little bit more to drive more volume? I know you've called out some categories that you don't think are worth it, but do you intend to keep that going and accelerate volume through? It seems like these price investments are working in that direction."

But I think a lot of what we're doing is being driven by mix and the way the sizing, the price points in terms of smaller sizes and in terms of different kinds of recipes and so forth, Jonathan. But yes, I mean I think, as I said a few minutes ago, in response to David's question about marketing spend in the second half, if we believe we can generate a better return by leveraging more promotion as opposed to just generalized traditional marketing, that's the way we will go. But it will depend on the business. In ketchup right now in the U.S., we're getting a great response from very traditional advertising as we are in Ore-Ida after balancing where we needed to be on price. In the Emerging Markets, we're getting very good price and the thing you got to remember in those markets is you have general inflation, which is also being reflected in wages and so forth. So the consumer is not as put off by price and private label is not a big issue. But I think, generally, even in the developed world, private label's no longer showing the kind of growth they did and it's really going to be a function of creating value in the mind of the consumer whether that value manifests itself in terms of better innovation, premium product, superior performance or a combination of promoted volume and/or better price points. It's just going to depend on the category and on where we think we're getting the best return. And clearly, in some of these businesses, price is going to be a better lever than other businesses. Clearly, in other cases, marketing's going to be the better lever and what we're trying to do is evaluate on elasticity basis exactly where we get the greatest leverage."

We have started the Foshan, China baby food factory, which we're going to try to have open in 2015. We've got a lot of investment going into India. We also have SAP investment coming in the second half of the year. And obviously, the finalization of the Innovation Center in Europe. So there's a fair amount of capital investment established in the second half the year. Frankly, my perspective is the lower I can keep that number, the happier I am as everybody who works for me knows. The reality is given the pressure we have on volume in the Emerging Markets, we have to provide capacity. As I said, we put a new pouch line into Mexico, we have a second one coming very shortly. We have a new pouch line going into Brazil. We're going to have a second one of those coming very shortly. We've got -- we are starting to produce ketchup in Brazil in the next 30 or 40 days. I think you've also got a fair amount of activity in the Asian markets, China, in particular, is an area we're going to have to continue to invest in, but -- so I think we'll be right around that number. To be honest with you, if I had my druthers, I'd try to bring it down. But right now given the SAP implementation and capacity needs I have in the business, I can't. The final thing is we're pretty much out of capacity on Dip & Squeeze. We're going to look at a fourth line on Dip & Squeeze. Where that line goes is yet to be determined. It'll be interesting to see where that line goes. I think you should not assume that line is automatically going into the U.S. but that is a line that we will have to start talking about in the second half of the year because we're out of capacity and the Emerging Markets are all yelling and screaming at me for Dip & Squeeze capabilities. So it's mainly about SAP implementation and about adding capacity in the Emerging Markets where we're getting significant growth."

Secondly, innovation in the U.K. is up 50% year-on-year in the second half. We have a significant amount of innovation in the Emerging Markets, particularly behind pouch initiatives. We've got a significant amount of innovation coming in the U.S., more of which I'll detail at CAGNY. We have a lot of activity in other parts of Europe as well, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. So there's a significant amount of new product activity in the second half of the year and a significant response to the marketing spending that we've initiated in the first half the year, much of which really didn't begin until the second quarter and you'll see a follow-through in the third quarter. So I think in that context, I feel reasonably sanguine. Let me underline those 2 words, reasonably sanguine, about strong volume growth or strong organic sales growth in the second half of the year. The Emerging Markets, as I said, last year at this time, relative to the second half, should be much stronger in the second half of this year than they were in the first half of this year. We're seeing huge pickup in Brazil. Hopefully, the new ketchup line will be ready. We've launched Heinz tomato paste. It's doing very well. The enabling lines we've now put in Mexico will allow us to start shipping baby food more aggressively. What we're doing in Indonesia with the launches in the second half, which are all predominantly condiments and sauces launches; a lot of activity in terms of our expansion of our food -- of our condiments and sauces business in China, as well as some food service initiatives; and the focus on ketchup, the continued strength of ketchup in the European continent; and then just the general success of Russia should help us drive volume in the second half of the year. I feel pretty good about the third quarter. The fourth quarter is really where we're going to have the big measurement year-on-year. But the forecasts coming in from our operating teams are all pretty optimistic about volume growth. There is organic sales growth in the second half of the year. So right now we see no reason to back off that. And I'll remind you, we have generated about 4% through the first half this year and that's without the benefit of some of the marketing that you'll see in the second half."

And to be honest with you, I don't have any idea how much it was in the second quarter. I don't think it was very significant based on what I'm hearing from the operating team. So I think it's still going to be a second half and fiscal '14 story for the company. But we're so far behind where many of our peers are that it's still a big opportunity. And in terms of volume going forward, I mean, clearly -- and I assume you're talking the U.S. but if you're not, please let me know, I feel reasonably -- again, reasonably good about the activities we have in the second half of the year. I think the management team in the U.S. has done an excellent job on refocusing on innovation. I was at the Innovation Center in North America a week ago Friday and spent the whole afternoon with them reviewing a litany of the new product initiatives underway and some of the activities that will start hitting the market late in this fiscal year, which will add some benefit in Q4, but really should have the bulk of their benefit next year beyond pipeline fill. So again, a lot of -- excuse me, a lot of activity in potatoes, a lot of activity in sauces and a lot of activity in some other areas that I think will be interesting. If you look at our business, the strongest category growth in any of our businesses in developed markets is vinegar and barbecue sauce, and the U.S. Vinegar is growing as a category at a double-digit rate, as are we, and so we're going to leverage that and look for opportunities there as well. So again, I think there's some opportunities in the second half of the year to drive better volume than we did in the first half in the U.S. company."

I mean, I think right now, if you go back to the Senate bill, the Senate bill capped dividend tax at 20% plus a 3.8% Medicare tax. The President wants to take it through ordinary income tax. The Republicans want to keep it at 15 points plus a 3.8%. So I think there's likely to be some kind of compromise on dividend tax. Secondly, most of our investors, Eric, are still telling us they'd prefer to see it in the form of dividends and share buybacks. And so our strategy continues to be, in terms of the deployment of cash, M&A, and as I said we have an aggressive pipeline full of M&A. A lot of initiatives underway, several of which I hope would get done sooner rather than later, but we'll see. As you know that's a tricky game. And then the second use would be cash and then obviously we'll continue to buy back stock in order to prevent dilution from outstanding shares. But right now we don't see a change. I don't know how the fiscal cliff is going to manifest itself, how it's going to manage out. Obviously, if we start hearing from our investors and we start seeing a dramatic shift, then we'll be flexible in terms of what's going to create the most value. It's just right now our belief is based on what we're hearing that dividends are still the best way for us to deploy cash back to our investors. That may change. And if it does, then obviously we'll modify our approach but right now that's where we are."
