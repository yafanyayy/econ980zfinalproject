Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 4 in the slide deck.
Quarter one was a story of great earnings growth on good, but uneven sales results. On the sales front in a continued uncertain environment, we were pleased with 8% year-over-year organic growth. But there were mixed results by region. Europe, the region you might expect to be the weakest, was strong. And Asia, the region you would expect to be strong, was the weakest. I believe that during this period of moderating sales growth rates, we will continue to see mixed growth rates by region, as uncertain economic conditions, solutions, lumpiness and prior year comparisons have a greater impact on growth rates. 
Earnings per share in the quarter increased 22% compared to Q1 last year, which is pretty remarkable, given sales growth of 8%. Don't expect earnings conversion that strong every quarter, but we'll take credit for at this time. And return on invested capital, on an after-tax basis, continues to be very strong at 31.5%. 
On balance, I call it a very good start to the fiscal year. That was a quick summary. So let me share some highlights of the quarter, a few other highlights of the quarter. It was another great quarter in Latin America. The team there continues to successfully execute our growth and performance strategy, mining and oil and gas opportunities remain strong, and we are on track to start up production at our new facility in Brazil in the fourth quarter. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions, we had 13% sales growth in EMEA in quarter 1. About 4 points of this growth is from our recent acquisitions, which are performing well. We continue to see a divergence in the economic climate between Northern and Southern Europe, but we are well-positioned throughout the region to outperform the underlying markets. 
On the other side of the coin, Asia sales were flat in the quarter. Some of that was due to tough comps from quarter 1 last year and some from the hole that we dug in our solutions business with the great fourth quarter that we put on the board. 
In emerging Asia, in quarter 1, inflation concerns in liquidity issues dampened investment. However, quarter growth in the quarter outpaced sales growth, and we did build backlog in our solutions businesses. We are optimistic that China and India will take action to stimulate growth in the remainder of the year. So even though underlying growth rates have slowed, we remain confident that over the long term, emerging Asia will be the highest growth automation market, and we will continue to invest there. 
I was really pleased to see 22% growth in process this quarter. We are gaining traction with plant DAX and are winning larger process orders across a broad spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity, and we are executing well. 
Orders were very good in the quarter, and the book to bill in our solutions business was almost 1.3. I don't talk to investors a lot about our operations and engineering services organization, but they are doing a great job. We have a number of metrics to assess their performance on dimensions, light, on-time delivery, productivity and quality, and they are delivering on all fronts. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions to improving our customer's experience, which leads directly to higher levels of customer loyalty, and customer loyalty is the one of the most important measures of our success.
Let me share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. The global economic picture is still cloudy. Economic indicators in the U.S. are mixed and forecast for Europe are deteriorating. Growth rates in emerging markets are moderating. Customers CapEx spending vary widely across industries and regions. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With one quarter behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic conditions, we are not changing our sales outlook for the year. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, we are reaffirming fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45. Although we may see uneven results throughout the year, sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. I am pleased by how well our ecosystem, that is our partners, businesses, functions, regions and cultures, that they all come together to serve our customers and deliver great business performance. We know how to be flexible and collaborative and responsive to customer needs. That is what will enable us to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"
300504,145843180,210436,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slide that have been posted on the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,474 billion, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to",1280,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slide that have been posted on the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,474 billion, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about one point, and we experienced about a one point contribution from acquisitions. 
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 28% compared to $222 million a year ago. General corporate net expense was $20.9 million compared to $15.7 million in Q1 last year. General Corporate net expense was lower in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 22% increase compared to $1.04 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.9 million. And we purchased approximately 122,000 shares in the first quarter at a cost of about $8 million.
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year sales increase in Q1 was 8%. Sales declined sequentially by 11%. Currency translation accounted for about 2 points of that sequential decline. 
It's pretty typical for us to experience a sequential decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, but the 9% decline excluding currency is more significant than usual. We had unusually strong sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the solutions businesses. And as we discussed at the last earnings call, and as Keith mentioned, that created something of a hole in shipments for us in the first quarter. 
If you eliminate the currency impact, a normalized Q1 for the unusually strong fourth quarter shipments, you get to a more typical sequential decline. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart, a very significant improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expanded by 3 points. The margin improvement reflects a very strong contribution from volume leverage. We also experienced lower performance-based compensation expense year-over-year. We talked about the tailwind from that when we provided guidance in November. We realized a modest positive impact from price, pretty much as we expected. And these improvements were partially offset by increased spending. 
Conversion margins for the quarter was 57%, and that's extraordinarily good. But to echo Keith's comments, don't get too excited, this is likely to be the best quarter in the year for convergent margin. As we expected, lower performance-based compensation expense helped to boost the conversion margin. But also, in the first quarter, currency effects improved conversion margin. Currency cost a one point sales decline, but with a small positive net operating earnings contribution. 
The quarterly earnings impact at currency variations can be very valuable, and this was an unusually good quarter. You might recall, we had a couple of quarters last year where currency was a drag on our conversion performance. 
Spending did increase at the rate that we have reflected in our guidance. That was another important factor in the conversion performance. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting lower conversion margin based on increased spending, less favorable mix going forward and a more typical impact for currency effects. 
On a different note, though it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.5%. 
Now please turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased 6% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by one point. Sales were down 5% sequentially, but currency accounted for about 2 points of that decline. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 28.6%. That's up 3.7 points from Q1 last year. A very strong incremental margin performance, basically reflecting the items that I discussed on the previous slides, but also a more favorable sales mix in this segment compares to first quarter last year. 
The next slide 8 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 10% compared to last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about one point reduction due to currency. The product portion of Control Products & Solutions grew year-over-year at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment. the solutions and services businesses grew about 11%, excluding currency and acquisitions. 
Sales declined 15% sequentially, about 2 points due to currency and with Solutions & Services declining substantially more than products as expected given the very high solutions shipments in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Segment operating earnings increased 42% year-over-year with a related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin.
Switching to the next slide, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. 
A very good growth in the U.S. and Canada at 8% and 11%, respectively, and continued high growth in Latin America at 14%. EMEA came in at 13%. That would be 9%, excluding acquisitions. And this was the old lady region significantly affected by acquisitions this quarter. 
And then very unusual to see Asia basically flat year-over-year. Looking across the regions. I think it would be fair to say that Canada and EMEA outperformed expectations in Q1. EMEA especially, given the macro economic challenges in that market. And Asia-Pacific underperform. Keith talked about some of the reasons for the underperformance in his comments. Maybe the one thing I would reinforce is that we do expect to see improvement in Asia-Pacific sales performance in the balance of the year, and in the longer term, we continue to believe that the emerging markets in Asia remain one of our best growth opportunities.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of cash of $211 million that included a $300 million pretax discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension trust. We want is typically weaker cash flow the quarter. First quarter this year was particularly low, due to the pension contribution and the payout of a larger-than-normal performance-based compensation that was earned in expense in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line on this statement. 
Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the discretionary pension contribution, and we would expect conversion to be about 100% excluding the pension contribution. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. As Keith mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that revenue range represents growth for the full year between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce growth by about one point for the full year. That's the same as our previous guidance. However, if rates remain, if currency rates remains at the current level for the balance of the year, we have some risk to the sales outlook. 
In that case, we would expect to face an additional sales headwind of about one more point. We still expect segment margin to be about 18%, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate of about 24%. And finally, we continue to expect general corporate net expense be about $86 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi."

And so, what we're seeing there is, let me just start with some of the microeconomic to just characterize it a little bit. The BMI there, which is a sentiment indicator over the last quarter and a little over a quarter has been hovering right around the 50, which means basically, the growth. And so I think what we're seeing is we're now starting to feel the reflection of that in DC. And certainly, that's something that we've talked about and obviously, what else is going on there is still a bit of the tightening of the fiscal and monetary policies that are create -- that has a negative impact on growth, and now we see the government talking about changing that around to reignite their industries. So we continue to see good strength in the automotive sector. We continue to see positive OEM business in China. And certainly, oil and gas is a growth area going forward. So I would say it's a combination of some of their activities in transportation and then a few of the more heavy industries are well. But we're also seeing a slowdown in some of the government specter, government spending areas, the infrastructure, and some of the metals and cements. So in some of those areas, less optimism, but continued strength in some of the core areas for Rockwell, which is why we believe the remainder of the year will drive growth in China and in emerging Asia."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 4 in the slide deck.
Quarter 1 was a story of great earnings growth on good but uneven sales results. On the sales front, in a continued uncertain global environments, we were pleased with 8% year-over-year organic growth. But there were mixed results by region. Europe, the region you might expect to be the weakest, was strong. And Asia, the region you would expect to be strong, was the weakest. I believe that during this period of moderating sales growth rates, we will continue to see mixed growth rates by region, as uncertain economic conditions, solutions, lumpiness and prior-year comparisons have a greater impact on growth rates. 
Earnings per share in the quarter increased 22% compared to Q1 last year, which is pretty remarkable given sales growth of 8%. Don't expect earnings conversion that strong every quarter, but we'll take credit for it this time. And return on invested capital, on an after-tax basis, continues to be very strong at 31.5%. On balance, I call it a very good start to the fiscal year. That was a quick summary. 
So let me share some highlights of the quarter, a few other highlights of the quarter. It was another great quarter in Latin America. The team there continues to successfully execute our growth and performance strategy, mining and oil and gas opportunities remain strong, and we are on track to start up production at our new facility in Brazil in the fourth quarter. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions, we had 13% sales growth in EMEA in quarter 1. About 4 points of this growth is from our recent acquisitions, which are performing well. We continue to see a divergence in the economic climate between Northern and Southern Europe, but we are well positioned throughout the region to outperform the underlying markets. 
On the other side of the coin, Asia sales were flat in the quarter. Some of that was due to tough comps from quarter 1 last year and some from the hole that we dug in our solutions business with a great fourth quarter that we put on the board. 
In emerging Asia, in quarter 1, inflation concerns and liquidity issues dampened investment. However, quarter growth in the quarter outpaced sales growth, and we did build backlog in our solutions businesses. We are optimistic that China and India will take action to stimulate growth in the remainder of the year. So even though underlying growth rates have slowed, we remain confident that over the long term, emerging Asia will be the highest growth automation market, and we will continue to invest there. 
I was really pleased to see 22% growth in process this quarter. We are gaining traction with PlantPAx and are winning larger process orders across the broad spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity and we are executing well. 
Orders were very good in the quarter, and the book to bill in our solutions business was almost 1.3. I don't talk to investors a lot about our operations and engineering services organization, but they are doing a great job. We have a number of metrics to assess their performance on dimensions like on-time delivery, productivity, and quality, and they are delivering on all fronts. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions to improving our customer's experience, which leads directly to higher levels of customer loyalty. And customer loyalty is the one of the most important measures of our success.
Let me share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. The global economic picture is still cloudy. Economic indicators in the U.S. are mixed and forecast for Europe are deteriorating. Growth rates in the emerging markets are moderating. Customers CapEx spending plans vary widely across industries and regions. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With one quarter behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic conditions, we are not changing our sales outlook for the year. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, we are reaffirming fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45. Although we may see uneven results throughout the year, sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. I am pleased by how well our ecosystem, that is our partners, businesses, functions, regions and cultures, how they all come together to serve our customers and deliver great business performance. We know how to be flexible and collaborative and responsive to customer needs. That is what will enable us to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"
300504,145843180,210577,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slide that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,474 billion, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to",1283,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slide that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,474 billion, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The That year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced the sales by about 1 point, and we experienced about a 1 point contribution from acquisitions. 
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 28% compared to $222 million a year ago. General corporate net expense was $20.9 million compared to $15.7 million in Q1 last year. General Corporate net expense was lower in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 22% increase compared to $1.04 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.9 million. And we purchased approximately 122,000 shares in the first quarter at a cost of about $8 million.
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, they year-over-year sales increase in Q1 was 8%. Sales declined sequentially by 11%. Currency translation accounted for about 2 points of that sequential decline. 
It's pretty typical for us to experience a sequential decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, but the 9% decline excluding currency is more significant than usual. We had unusually strong sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the solutions businesses. And as we've discussed at the last earnings call, and as Keith mentioned, that created something of a hole in shipments for us in the first quarter. 
If you eliminate the currency impact and normalized Q1 for the unusually strong fourth quarter shipments, you get to a more typical sequential decline. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart, a very significant improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expanded by 3 points. The margin improvement reflects a very strong contribution from volume leverage. We also experienced lower performance-based compensation expense year-over-year. We talked about the tailwind from that when we provided guidance in November. We realized a modest positive impact from price, pretty much as we expected. And these improvements were partially offset by increased spending. 
Conversion margins for the quarter was 57%, and that's extraordinarily good. But to echo Keith's comment, don't get too excited, this is likely to be the best quarter of the year for conversion margins. As we expected, lower performance-based compensation expense helped to boost the conversion margin. But also, in the first quarter, currency effects improved conversion margin. Currency cost a 1 point sales decline, but with a small positive net operating earnings contribution. 
The quarterly earnings impact at currency variations can be very variable, and this was an unusually good quarter. You might recall, we had a couple of quarters last year where currency was a drag on our conversion performance. 
Spending did increase at the rate that we have reflected in our guidance. That was another important factor in the conversion performance. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting lower conversion margin based on increased spending, less favorable mix going forward and a more typical impact for currency effects. On a different note, though it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.5%. 
Now please turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased 6% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by 1 point. Sales were down 5% sequentially, but currency accounted for about 2 points of that decline. 
Operating margins for the quarter was 28.6%. That's up 3.7 points from Q1 last year, a very strong incremental margin performance, basically reflecting the items that I discussed on the previous slide, but also a more favorable sales mix in this segment compared to fourth -- first quarter last year. 
The next slide, 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 10% compared to last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about 1 point reduction due to currency. The product portion of Control Products & Solutions grew year-over-year at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment. The solutions and services businesses grew about 11%, excluding currency and acquisitions. 
Sales declined 15% sequentially about 2 points due to currency and with solutions and services declining substantially more than products as expected given the very high solutions shipments in the fourth quarter of last year. Segment operating earnings increased 42% year-over-year with a related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin.
Switching to the next slide, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. 
A very good growth in the U.S. and Canada at 8%, 11% respectively, and continued high growth in Latin America at 14%. EMEA came in at 13%, that would be 9% excluding acquisitions. And this was the only region significantly affected by acquisitions this quarter. And then very unusual to see Asia basically flat year-over-year. 
Looking across the regions. I think it would be fair to say that Canada and EMEA outperformed expectations in Q1; EMEA, especially given the macro economic challenges in that market, and Asia-Pacific underperformed. Keith talked about some of the reasons for the underperformance in his comments. Maybe the one thing I would reinforce is that we do expect to see improvement in Asia-Pacific sales performance in the balance of the year, and in the longer term, we continue to believe that the emerging markets in Asia remain one of our best growth opportunities.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of cash of $211 million that included a $300 million pretax discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension trust. Q1 is typically weaker cash flow quarter. First quarter this year was particularly low due to the pension contribution and the payout of a larger-than-normal performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line on this statement. 
Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the discretionary pension contribution, and we would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. As Keith mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that revenue range represents growth for the full year between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce growth by about 1 point for the full year. That's the same as our previous guidance. However, if rates remain and if currency rates remain at the current level for the balance of the year, we have some risk to the sales outlook. 
In that case, we would expect to face an additional sales headwind of about one more point. We still expect segment margin to be about 18%, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. We continue to expect the full year tax rate of about 24%. And finally, we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be about $86 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi."

And so what we're seeing there is -- let me just start with some of the macroeconomic to just characterize it a little bit. The PMI there, which is a sentiment indicator, over the last quarter and a little over a quarter has been hovering right around 50%, which means basically limited growth. And so I think what we're seeing is we're now starting to feel the reflection of that in indices. And certainly, that's something that we've talked about, and obviously, what else is going on there is a little bit of the tightening of the fiscal and monetary policies that are create -- that has a negative impact on growth. And now we see the government talking about changing that around to reignite their industries. So we continue to see good strength in the automotive sector. We continue to see positive OEM business in China. And certainly, oil and gas is a growth area going forward. So I would say it's a combination of some of their activities in transportation and then a few of the more heavy industries are well. But we're also seeing a slowdown in some of the government specter, government spending areas, the infrastructure, and some of the metals and cements.

And I certainly don't believe the exporting power of Europe and Germany is core to the, I think, the bigger issues inside of particularly emerging Asia, which really boils down to the inflation and tightening of the money supply or I should say, raising interest rates. I think they've managed to slow growth, and I think that was the strategy. And they've been successful. And now their concern is perhaps they went too far. And I think at least we're hearing the conversations of more stimulus and more government intervention, particularly in China, less so in India, but it's a similar situation. So I think it's more of those financial and economic areas that are impacting emerging Asia at this point in time. And then your other question was with respect to market share. We do believe we are growing share in the machine OEM market in Europe. And I think our growth in both our controllers and our motion of platforms, as well as the continued expansion of our customer base there, is a positive sign of that, and basically, a continuation of the strategy that we started a couple of years ago.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 4 in the slide deck.
Quarter 1 was a story of great earnings growth on good but uneven sales results. On the sales front, in a continued uncertain global environment, we were pleased with 8% year-over-year organic growth. But there were mixed results by region. Europe, the region you might expect to be the weakest, was strong. And Asia, the region you would expect to be strong, was the weakest. I believe that during this period of moderating sales growth rates, we will continue to see mixed growth rates by region, as uncertain economic conditions, solutions, lumpiness and prior year comparisons have a greater impact on growth rates. 
Earnings per share in the quarter increased 22% compared to Q1 last year, which is pretty remarkable given sales growth of 8%. Don't expect earnings conversion that strong every quarter, but we'll take credit for it this time. And return on invested capital, on an after-tax basis, continues to be very strong at 31.5%. On balance, I call it a very good start to the fiscal year. That was a quick summary. 
So let me share some highlights of the quarter, a few other highlights of the quarter. It was another great quarter in Latin America. The team there continues to successfully execute our growth and performance strategy, mining and oil and gas opportunities remain strong, and we are on track to start up production at our new facility in Brazil in the fourth quarter. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions, we had 13% sales growth in EMEA in quarter 1. About 4 points of this growth is from our recent acquisitions, which are performing well. We continue to see a divergence in the economic climate between Northern and Southern Europe, but we are well positioned throughout the region to outperform the underlying markets. 
On the other side of the coin, Asia sales were flat in the quarter. Some of that was due to tough comps from quarter 1 last year and some from the hole that we dug in our solutions business with the great fourth quarter that we put on the board. 
In emerging Asia, in quarter 1, inflation concerns and liquidity issues dampened investment. However, quarter growth in the quarter outpaced sales growth, and we did build backlog in our solutions businesses. We are optimistic that China and India will take action to stimulate growth in the remainder of the year. So even though underlying growth rates have slowed, we remain confident that over the long term, emerging Asia will be the highest growth automation market, and we will continue to invest there. 
I was really pleased to see 22% growth in process this quarter. We are gaining traction with PlantPAx and are winning larger process orders across a broad spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity and we are executing well. 
Orders were very good in the quarter, and the book to bill in our solutions business was almost 1.3. I don't talk to investors a lot about our operations and engineering services organization, but they are doing a great job. We have a number of metrics to assess their performance on dimensions like on-time delivery, productivity and quality, and they are delivering on all fronts. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions to improving our customer's experience, which leads directly to higher levels of customer loyalty. And customer loyalty is one of the most important measures of our success.
Let me share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. The global economic picture is still cloudy. Economic indicators in the U.S. are mixed and forecasts for Europe are deteriorating. Growth rates in the emerging markets are moderating. Customers’ CapEx spending plans vary widely across industries and regions. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With one quarter behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic conditions, we are not changing our sales outlook for the year. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, we are reaffirming fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45. Although we may see uneven results throughout the year, sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. I am pleased by how well our ecosystem, that is our partners, businesses, functions, regions and cultures, how they all come together to serve our customers and deliver great business performance. We know how to be flexible and collaborative and responsive to customer needs. That is what will enable us to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"
300504,145843180,210612,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,474,000,000, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to",1284,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,474,000,000, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 1 point, and we experienced about a 1 point contribution from acquisitions. 
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 28% compared to $222 million a year ago. General corporate net expense was $20.9 million compared to $15.7 million in Q1 last year. General Corporate net expense was lower in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 22% increase compared to $1.04 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.9 million. And we purchased approximately 122,000 shares in the first quarter at a cost of about $8 million.
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year sales increase in Q1 was 8%. Sales declined sequentially by 11%. Currency translation accounted for about 2 points of that sequential decline. 
It's pretty typical for us to experience a sequential decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, but the 9% decline excluding currency is more significant than usual. We had unusually strong sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the solutions businesses. And as we've discussed at the last earnings call, and as Keith mentioned, that created something of a hole in shipments for us in the first quarter. 
If you eliminate the currency impact and normalize Q1 for the unusually strong fourth quarter shipments, you get to a more typical sequential decline. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart, a very significant improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expanded by 3 points. The margin improvement reflects a very strong contribution from volume leverage. We also experienced lower performance-based compensation expense year-over-year. We talked about the tailwind from that when we provided guidance in November. We realized a modest positive impact from price, pretty much as we expected. And these improvements were partially offset by increased spending. 
Conversion margins for the quarter was 57%, and that's extraordinarily good. But to echo Keith's comments, don't get too excited, this is likely to be the best quarter of the year for conversion margin. As we expected, lower performance-based compensation expense helped to boost the conversion margin. But also, in the first quarter, currency effects improved conversion margin. Currency caused a 1-point sales decline but with a small positive net operating earnings contribution. 
The quarterly earnings impact of currency variations can be very variable, and this was an unusually good quarter. You might recall, we had a couple of quarters last year where currency was a drag on our conversion performance. 
Spending didn’t increase at the rate that we had reflected in our guidance. That was another important factor in the conversion performance. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting lower conversion margin based on increased spending, less favorable mix going forward and a more typical impact from currency effects. On a different note, though it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.5%. 
Now please turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased 6% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by 1 point. Sales were down 5% sequentially, but currency accounted for about 2 points of that decline. 
Operating margins for the quarter was 28.6%. That's up 3.7 points from Q1 last year, a very strong incremental margin performance, basically reflecting the items that I discussed on the previous slide, but also a more favorable sales mix in this segment compared to fourth -- first quarter last year. 
The next slide, 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 10% compared to last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about 1 point reduction due to currency. The product portion of Control Products & Solutions grew year-over-year at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment. The solutions and services businesses grew about 11%, excluding currency and acquisitions. 
Sales declined 15% sequentially, about 2 points due to currency, and with solutions and services declining substantially more than products as expected given the very high solutions shipments in the fourth quarter of last year. Segment operating earnings increased 42% year-over-year with a related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin.
Switching to the next slide, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. 
A very good growth in the U.S. and Canada at 8% and 11%, respectively, and continued high growth in Latin America at 14%. EMEA came in at 13%, that would be 9% excluding acquisitions. And this was the only region significantly affected by acquisitions this quarter. And then very unusual to see Asia basically flat year-over-year. 
Looking across the regions. I think it would be fair to say that Canada and EMEA outperformed expectations in Q1; EMEA especially, given the macro economic challenges in that market, and Asia Pacific underperformed. Keith talked about some of the reasons for the underperformance in his comments. Maybe the one thing I would reinforce is that we do expect to see improvement in Asia Pacific sales performance in the balance of the year, and in the longer term, we continue to believe that the emerging markets in Asia remain one of our best growth opportunities.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of cash of $211 million that included a $300 million pretax discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension trust. Q1 is typically a weaker cash flow quarter. First quarter this year was particularly low due to the pension contribution and the payout of a larger-than-normal performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line on this statement. 
Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the discretionary pension contribution, and we would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. As Keith mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that revenue range represents growth for the full year of between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce growth by about 1 point for the full year. That's the same as our previous guidance. However, if rates remain and if currency rates remain at the current level for the balance of the year, we have some risk to the sales outlook. 
In that case, we would expect to face an additional sales headwind of about one more point. We still expect segment margin to be about 18%, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And finally, we continue to expect General Corporate net expense to be about $86 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi."

Well, as we said, and as you commented, China was a tough comparison in particular in the quarter because of the 40% growth that we had last year. And so what we're seeing there is -- let me just start with some of the macroeconomic to just characterize it a little bit. The PMI there, which is a sentiment indicator, over the last quarter and a little over a quarter has been hovering right around 50%, which means basically limited growth. And so I think what we're seeing is we're now starting to feel the reflection of that indice [ph]. And certainly, that's something that we've talked about, and obviously, what else is going on there is a little bit of a tightening of the fiscal and monetary policies that are create -- that have a negative impact on growth. And now we see the government talking about changing that around to reignite their industry. So we continue to see good strength in the automotive sector. We continue to see positive OEM business in China. And certainly, oil and gas is a growth area going forward. So I would say it's a combination of some of their activities in transportation and then a few of the more heavy industries are well. But we're also seeing a slowdown in some of the government specter, government spending areas, the infrastructure, and some of the metals and cements. So in some of those areas, less optimism, but continued strength in some of the core areas for Rockwell, which is why we believe the remainder of the year will drive growth in China and in emerging Asia."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 4 in the slide deck.
Quarter 1 was a story of great earnings growth on good but uneven sales results. On the sales front, in a continued uncertain global environment, we were pleased with 8% year-over-year organic growth. But there were mixed results by region. Europe, the region you might expect to be the weakest, was strong. And Asia, the region you would expect to be strong, was the weakest. I believe that during this period of moderating sales growth rates, we will continue to see mixed growth rates by region, as uncertain economic conditions, solutions, lumpiness and prior year comparisons have a greater impact on growth rates. 
Earnings per share in the quarter increased 22% compared to Q1 last year, which is pretty remarkable given sales growth of 8%. Don't expect earnings conversion that strong every quarter, but we'll take credit for it this time. And return on invested capital, on an after-tax basis, continues to be very strong at 31.5%. On balance, I call it a very good start to the fiscal year. That was a quick summary. 
So let me share some highlights of the quarter, a few other highlights of the quarter. It was another great quarter in Latin America. The team there continues to successfully execute our growth and performance strategy, mining and oil and gas opportunities remain strong, and we are on track to start up production at our new facility in Brazil in the fourth quarter. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions, we had 13% sales growth in EMEA in quarter 1. About 4 points of this growth is from our recent acquisitions, which are performing well. We continue to see a divergence in the economic climate between Northern and Southern Europe, but we are well positioned throughout the region to outperform the underlying markets. 
On the other side of the coin, Asia sales were flat in the quarter. Some of that was due to tough comps from quarter 1 last year and some from the hole that we dug in our solutions business with the great fourth quarter that we put on the board. 
In emerging Asia, in quarter 1, inflation concerns and liquidity issues dampened investment. However, quarter growth in the quarter outpaced sales growth, and we did build backlog in our solutions businesses. We are optimistic that China and India will take action to stimulate growth in the remainder of the year. So even though underlying growth rates have slowed, we remain confident that over the long term, emerging Asia will be the highest growth automation market, and we will continue to invest there. 
I was really pleased to see 22% growth in process this quarter. We are gaining traction with PlantPAx and are winning larger process orders across a broad spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity and we are executing well. 
Orders were very good in the quarter, and the book to bill in our solutions business was almost 1.3. I don't talk to investors a lot about our operations and engineering services organization, but they are doing a great job. We have a number of metrics to assess their performance on dimensions like on-time delivery, productivity and quality, and they are delivering on all fronts. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions to improving our customer's experience, which leads directly to higher levels of customer loyalty. And customer loyalty is one of the most important measures of our success.
Let me share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. The global economic picture is still cloudy. Economic indicators in the U.S. are mixed and forecasts for Europe are deteriorating. Growth rates in the emerging markets are moderating. Customers’ CapEx spending plans vary widely across industries and regions. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With one quarter behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic conditions, we are not changing our sales outlook for the year. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, we are reaffirming fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45. Although we may see uneven results throughout the year, sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company. 
I'd like to close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. I am pleased by how well our ecosystem, that is our partners, businesses, functions, regions and cultures, how they all come together to serve our customers and deliver great business performance. We know how to be flexible and collaborative and responsive to customer needs. That is what will enable us to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?"
300504,145843180,210685,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,474,000,000, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to",1284,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,474,000,000, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 1 point, and we experienced about a 1 point contribution from acquisitions. 
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 28% compared to $222 million a year ago. General corporate net expense was $20.9 million compared to $15.7 million in Q1 last year. General Corporate net expense was lower in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the sale of an investment. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 22% increase compared to $1.04 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.9 million. And we purchased approximately 122,000 shares in the first quarter at a cost of about $8 million.
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year sales increase in Q1 was 8%. Sales declined sequentially by 11%. Currency translation accounted for about 2 points of that sequential decline. 
It's pretty typical for us to experience a sequential decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, but the 9% decline excluding currency is more significant than usual. We had unusually strong sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the solutions businesses. And as we've discussed at the last earnings call, and as Keith mentioned, that created something of a hole in shipments for us in the first quarter. 
If you eliminate the currency impact and normalize Q1 for the unusually strong fourth quarter shipments, you get to a more typical sequential decline. 
Moving to the earnings side of the chart, a very significant improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expanded by 3 points. The margin improvement reflects a very strong contribution from volume leverage. We also experienced lower performance-based compensation expense year-over-year. We talked about the tailwind from that when we provided guidance in November. We realized a modest positive impact from price, pretty much as we expected. And these improvements were partially offset by increased spending. 
Conversion margins for the quarter was 57%, and that's extraordinarily good. But to echo Keith's comments, don't get too excited, this is likely to be the best quarter of the year for conversion margin. As we expected, lower performance-based compensation expense helped to boost the conversion margin. But also, in the first quarter, currency effects improved conversion margin. Currency caused a 1-point sales decline but with a small positive net operating earnings contribution. 
The quarterly earnings impact of currency variations can be very variable, and this was an unusually good quarter. You might recall, we had a couple of quarters last year where currency was a drag on our conversion performance. 
Spending didn’t increase at the rate that we had reflected in our guidance. That was another important factor in the conversion performance. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting lower conversion margin based on increased spending, less favorable mix going forward and a more typical impact from currency effects. On a different note, though it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.5%. 
Now please turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased 6% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by 1 point. Sales were down 5% sequentially, but currency accounted for about 2 points of that decline. 
Operating margins for the quarter was 28.6%. That's up 3.7 points from Q1 last year, a very strong incremental margin performance, basically reflecting the items that I discussed on the previous slide, but also a more favorable sales mix in this segment compared to fourth -- first quarter last year. 
The next slide, 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 10% compared to last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about 1 point reduction due to currency. The product portion of Control Products & Solutions grew year-over-year at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment. The solutions and services businesses grew about 11%, excluding currency and acquisitions. 
Sales declined 15% sequentially, about 2 points due to currency, and with solutions and services declining substantially more than products as expected given the very high solutions shipments in the fourth quarter of last year. Segment operating earnings increased 42% year-over-year with a related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin.
Switching to the next slide, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. 
A very good growth in the U.S. and Canada at 8% and 11%, respectively, and continued high growth in Latin America at 14%. EMEA came in at 13%, that would be 9% excluding acquisitions. And this was the only region significantly affected by acquisitions this quarter. And then very unusual to see Asia basically flat year-over-year. 
Looking across the regions. I think it would be fair to say that Canada and EMEA outperformed expectations in Q1; EMEA especially, given the macro economic challenges in that market, and Asia Pacific underperformed. Keith talked about some of the reasons for the underperformance in his comments. Maybe the one thing I would reinforce is that we do expect to see improvement in Asia Pacific sales performance in the balance of the year, and in the longer term, we continue to believe that the emerging markets in Asia remain one of our best growth opportunities.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of cash of $211 million that included a $300 million pretax discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension trust. Q1 is typically a weaker cash flow quarter. First quarter this year was particularly low due to the pension contribution and the payout of a larger-than-normal performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line on this statement. 
Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the discretionary pension contribution, and we would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. As Keith mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that revenue range represents growth for the full year of between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce growth by about 1 point for the full year. That's the same as our previous guidance. However, if rates remain and if currency rates remain at the current level for the balance of the year, we have some risk to the sales outlook. 
In that case, we would expect to face an additional sales headwind of about one more point. We still expect segment margin to be about 18%, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And finally, we continue to expect General Corporate net expense to be about $86 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi."

Well, as we said, and as you commented, China was a tough comparison in particular in the quarter because of the 40% growth that we had last year. And so what we're seeing there is -- let me just start with some of the macroeconomic to just characterize it a little bit. The PMI there, which is a sentiment indicator, over the last quarter and a little over a quarter has been hovering right around 50%, which means basically limited growth. And so I think what we're seeing is we're now starting to feel the reflection of that indice [ph]. And certainly, that's something that we've talked about, and obviously, what else is going on there is a little bit of a tightening of the fiscal and monetary policies that are create -- that have a negative impact on growth. And now we see the government talking about changing that around to reignite their industry. So we continue to see good strength in the automotive sector. We continue to see positive OEM business in China. And certainly, oil and gas is a growth area going forward. So I would say it's a combination of some of their activities in transportation and then a few of the more heavy industries are well. But we're also seeing a slowdown in some of the government specter, government spending areas, the infrastructure, and some of the metals and cements.

And I think at least we're hearing the conversations of more stimulus and more government intervention, particularly in China, less so in India, but it's a similar situation. So I think it's more of those financial and economic areas that are impacting emerging Asia at this point in time. And then your other question was with respect to market share. We do believe we are growing share in the machine OEM market in Europe. And I think our growth in both our controllers and our motion platforms, as well as the continued expansion of our customer base there, is a positive sign of that, and basically, a continuation of the strategy that we started a couple of years ago. And our team in Europe is executing very well in that regard."

I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. 
The first portion of my remarks will cover some highlights for the quarter and a summary of our performance in the first half of the year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. 
We have solid 8% growth, excluding currency in Q2, and 7% organic growth. I was really pleased to see solid organic growth in every region. North American market conditions have remained healthy. Our reported sales growth in the U.S. was 5% this quarter. But because of an unusually large project that shift in quarter 2 last year, we believe that understates the strength of market conditions in the U.S. 
We carved that large project out, growth in the U.S. would have been several points higher. Canada was a standout with 25% growth. We are successfully capitalizing on the strength of resource-based industries there. 
Europe had another strong quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. Our team there is executing very well in a difficult environment. 
I was encouraged to see Asia return to double-digit growth in the quarter. China improved to high single-digit growth, and we are optimistic that market conditions will continue to improve in the second half of the year. 
Our outlook for India is more cautious. Sales in India were flat in the quarter, and we have yet to see evidence of improvement in the economy. 
Lastly, while Latin America organic sales were only up 4% in the quarter, they have difficult comparison to a great quarter last year. Orders were strong in the quarter, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year.
I hope that regional color was helpful. I have a few other second quarter highlights this year before I move on to the first half. 
Our process business continue to gain traction and delivered another quarter of over 20% sales growth. We continue to extend our integrated network, which is enabling us to pursue a broader spectrum of applications in all regions. 
Process remains our greatest growth opportunity, and we are executing well. We introduced 2 new Logix mid-range controller platforms that improves scalability and even connectivity, plus enhanced motion for our OEM customers. 
For the fourth time, we were recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. This award is a real tribute to the efforts of all of our employees and the importance of ethics in our culture. Ted will provide more detail on second quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'd like to provide a few highlights on the first half of the fiscal year.
I am pleased with our year-over-year performance through the end of March. Sales grew over 8%, excluding currency. Operating margin expanded 1.7 points and segment conversion margin was over 40%. 
Earnings per share in the first half grew 12%, in spite of a pretty significant headwind from taxes. And we continue to generate best-in-class return on invested capital. 
So far, the year has played out a little differently than we thought it would. Developed market have been a bit stronger, and emerging markets weaker than we originally expected. But overall, at the halfway of the year, we're pretty much where we expected to be and we are well-positioned as we enter the second half. 
So this is how we're thinking about the second half. We expect sequential sales growth in all regions and across our product and solutions and services businesses. We had a good first half in developed markets, and we expect those markets to remain solid for the rest of the year. 
In Emerging markets, we expect stronger growth in the second half of the  year. Our outlook for China and Latin America is strong. We expect to return to double-digit growth in the second half. But we are more cautious on India, as we had yet to see signs of economic improvement there.
Despite some mid signals in the environment, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With 2 quarters behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we are maintaining the mid-point of both our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year and narrowing the ranges. The narrowed range for earnings per share guidance is $5.10 to $5.40. Sales and earnings within our guidance ranges will represent another record year for the company. Ted will provide more color the assumptions in our guidance in his remarks. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. We are executing our growth and performance strategy well, and that will enable us to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, I'll now hand it over to Ted."

I'll be referencing the slides on the website, and I'll start with Slide #5, which is titled Second Quarter Results Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,561,000,000, up 7% compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about one point and the contribution from acquisitions increased sales by about a point. 
Segment operating earnings were $268 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago. General Corporate net was $25.1 million compared to $20.5 million in Q2 last year. The increase was due to a $7 million legacy environmental charge related to former Rockwell International sites. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.9%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up a bit from last year. While we have reasonable increase in segment operating earnings, the combination of our legacy environmental charge and higher tax rate reduced EPS by about $0.13. 
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $144.7 million. And during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 508,000 shares at a cost of about $41 million. 
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the second quarter. As I noted on a prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales in Q2 was 7%. Sales increased by 6% sequentially. 
On the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings were $268 million, up 10% compared to Q2 last year, with segment operating margin at 17.2%, up by 0.5 point by last year. The year-over-year margin expansion is due primarily to volume leverage and a favorable contribution from price, partially offset by increased spending. 
It's a similar year-over-year margin cost in both segments. Sequentially, operating earnings declined by about 5% and segment operating margin was 2 points lower. 
Last quarter, we talked about Q1 being an unusually strong margin quarter and we said that we expected lower operating margins in the balance of the year. All the factors we said would cause margins to be lower in the balance of the year came into play in the second quarter, and that was less favorable mix, the normal January wage and salary increases, other increased spending and a less favorable impact from currency. 
As Keith pointed out, we're pleased with the first half performance, including margins, segment operating margins for the first half was 18.2%, up 1.7 points compared to the first half of last year and with the related conversion margin of 42%.
Although it's not shown on the slide, our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 30.5%. I'll turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q2 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales increased 7% year-over-year, reaching $665 million. Currency translation reduced sales by about 1 point. 
Sales increased 2% sequentially in the segment. Operating margins for the quarter was 25.2%, up 8/10 of a point from Q2 last year. And year-to-date, operating margin in Architecture & Software is 26.9%, up 2.2 points from last year.
On Slide 8, you'll see the results for our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to Q2 last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a one point reduction due to currency. And with particularly strong growth in the solutions and services businesses. 
Sales increased 9% sequentially in control products and solutions. Segment operating earnings were $101 million, with segment operating margin up 2/10 of a point from the same quarter last year. 
Year-to-date, Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.4 points compared to last year. 
Switching to the next slide, this is a look at regional sales performance. You can see here the growth rates by region, both as reported and excluding currency effects. Keith covered most of the regional highlights in his comments. So perhaps, I'll provide just a bit more color for EMEA. 
EMEA continue to deliver very good results with 12% currency unusual growth. You can see that on the far right column. EMEA was the only region with a significant impact from acquisitions in the quarter. But excluding the effect of acquisitions, EMEA still had a very healthy 7% increase year-over-year. 
I'll turn now to Slide #10, the free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million, that's about 137% conversion on net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, and that includes the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter. 
We would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. 
This slide provides a comparison of first half results to the full year guidance. Looking at the first pass results, as I mentioned, we are pleased with the gross insults, the margin performance and the EPS performance and we're pretty much very expected to be at the midyear point. 
As Keith mentioned, with 2 quarters behind us, we have narrowed the guidance. We now expect sales for the full year in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. That compares to the previous guidance of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. 
We expect currency translation to reduce sales by 2 points for the full year. Our previous guidance assumes a one point decreased due to currency. 
Last quarter, you may remember, we identified currency as a risk to the full year sales confidence with another quarter of experience behind us, we're are now building that into the guidance. Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of between 6% and 9%. Previous guidance was 5% to 9%. 
The $50 million drop at the top end of the sales range primarily reflects the increased negative impact due to currency. At the bottom end of the sales range, we're absorbing the negative currency impact, but increasing our expectation for full year organic growth by about one point. 
We still expect segment margin to be around 18%, probably a little better. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date. And we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.40. The $0.05 reduction at the high end of the EPS range includes the more negative impact of currency. 
We continue to expect the full year tax rate of about 24%. And finally, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year. That's up from the previous guidance of $86 million. And the increase reflects the legacy environmental charges that were incurred in Q2. 
And with that, I'll turn this back over to Rondi."

The continuing debt crisis in the South impacting a little bit. Stronger into Spain and Italy now. And the North, being more of the exporting region, goes back to my earlier comments. And then the last point I'd make with respect to Europe would be that emerging aspects, which for us would be areas like Russia and Turkey, they continue to perform well in the second quarter, equally strong, almost equally as strong as they were in our first quarter.

Your comments about, and specifically, to the U.S., and the expansion into large scale chemical complexes, I would say that is one of the places that is not Rockwell Automation's sweet spot. That is very similar to what we talked about in the oil and gas segment being refining, the bulk chemical projects, the majority of our applications there and where we do have and where we are capable and will participate is in the intelligent motor control aspects of that business with our medium voltage drives and motor control centers and our safety systems from a process standpoint. And there, we will become a significant participant and to work with the companies that are starting that up, that are talking about those new facility. But when you look at the main process control, that is an area that while we have capabilities, that would not be our historical strength.

As far as the penetration, we continue to expand the opportunities for Logix. So we have not -- and when I say that I mean, we're expanding that serve market for Logix.

The addition of safety, the addition of broader Internet capabilities, all of this is expanding the's scalability, and therefore, the serve market for Logix. So our penetration, in one way, you can say it keeps going down because we keep expanding the market. So we believe we still have one way to grow Logix as we go forward.

What are we seeing that's different? Well, I think, a couple of things. First, our team there is doing a very good job at uncovering new customers and new applications. And that does take a little bit of time, and that's why sometimes you get a dwell period, particularly when the economy is slowing. And we have seen that in China. And I think all of the statistics point to that, which is something that you've seen. As -- where are we seeing this now? I think we're starting to see some of the liquidity problems working their way through the system. We would hope that, that is going to be a continuing thing as we go through the year, which is why we believe the uptake will come up. And we see a split really between large customers and smaller customers yet. The larger companies are getting stronger and investing more. And we still see some of the pain at those smaller customers at this point. And that's really driven because of the liquidity problems that I talked about. The other reason we think we're going to see a better second half is our front load activity has picked up, and that really goes back to the earlier comments I made about our sales organization is working very aggressively. We believe OEMs continue to be strong for us, to be able to create new OEM to take time to work with them in the design phase and the design cycle. So we're expecting a pickup with OEMs as we go forward. And just the ongoing maturity of our distributors and our system integrators will help, and should always help, provide some tailwind as well. But that's also a long-term process for us as well. So I think those would be the thoughts that we have with respect to China, both current and why we feel we will expect to see an acceleration in the second half."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover some highlights for the quarter and a summary of our performance in the first half of the year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. We had solid 8% growth excluding currency in Q2 and 7% organic growth. 
I was really pleased to see solid organic growth in every region. North American market conditions have remained healthy. Our reported sales growth in the U.S. was 5% this quarter. But because of an unusually large project that shift in quarter 2 last year, we believe that understates the strength of market conditions in the U.S. If we carve that large project out, growth in the U.S. would have been several points higher. Canada was a standout with 25% growth. We are successfully capitalizing on the strength of resource-based industries there. 
Europe had another strong quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. Our team there is executing very well in a difficult environment. 
I was encouraged to see Asia return to double-digit growth in the quarter. China improved to high single-digit growth, and we are optimistic that market conditions will continue to improve in the second half of the year. Our outlook for India is more cautious. Sales in India were flat in the quarter, and we have yet to see evidence of improvement in the economy. 
Lastly, while Latin America organic sales were only up 4% in the quarter, they have difficult comparison to a great quarter last year. Orders were strong in the quarter, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. I hope that regional color was helpful. I have a few other second quarter highlights this year before I move on to the first half. 
Our Process business continued to gain traction and delivered another quarter of over 20% sales growth. We continue to expand our integrated network, which is enabling us to pursue a broader spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity, and we are executing well. We introduced 2 new Logix mid-range controller platforms that improves scalability and Ethernet connectivity, plus enhanced motion for our OEM customers. 
For the fourth time, we were recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. This award is a real tribute to the efforts of all of our employees and the importance of ethics in our culture. 
Ted will provide more detail on second quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'd like to provide a few highlights on the first half of the fiscal year. 
I am pleased with our year-over-year performance through the end of March. Sales grew over 8%, excluding currency. Operating margin expanded 1.7 points, and segment conversion margin was over 40%.  Earnings per share in the first half grew 12% in spite of a pretty significant headwind from taxes, and we continue to generate best-in-class return on invested capital. 
So far, the year has played out a little differently than we thought it would. Developed markets have been a bit stronger, and emerging markets weaker than we originally expected. But overall, at the halfway point of the year, we're pretty much where we expected to be and we're well positioned as we enter the second half. 
So this is how we're thinking about the second half. We expect sequential sales growth in all regions and across our Product & Solutions and services businesses. We had a good first half in developed markets, and we expect those markets to remain solid for the rest of the year. 
In emerging markets, we expect stronger growth in the second half of the  year. Our outlook for China and Latin America is strong. We expect to return to double-digit growth in the second half. But we are more cautious on India, as we had yet to see signs of economic improvement there.
Despite some mixed signals in the macro environment, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With 2 quarters behind us and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we are maintaining the midpoint of both our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year and narrowing the ranges. The narrowed range for earnings per share guidance is $5.10 to $5.40. Sales and earnings within our guidance ranges would represent another record year for the company. Ted will provide more color on the assumptions in our guidance in his remarks. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. We are executing our growth and performance strategy well, and that will enable us to deliver superior returns to our share owners. 
With that, I'll now hand it over to Ted."

I'll be referencing the slides on the website, and I'll start with Slide #5, which is titled Second Quarter Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,561,000,000, up 7% compared to the second q",1128,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody out there. I'll be referencing the slides on the website, and I'll start with Slide #5, which is titled Second Quarter Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,561,000,000, up 7% compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about one point and the contribution from acquisitions increased sales by about a point. 
Segment operating earnings were $268 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago. General corporate net was $25.1 million compared to $20.5 million in Q2 last year. The increase was due to a $7 million legacy environmental charge related to former Rockwell International sites. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.9%. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up a bit from last year. While we had a reasonable increase in segment operating earnings, the combination of our legacy environmental charge and a higher tax rate reduced EPS by about $0.13. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 144.7 million, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 508,000 shares at a cost of about $41 million. 
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the second quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q2 was 7%. Sales increased by 6% sequentially. 
On the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings were $268 million, up 10% compared to Q2 last year, with segment operating margin at 17.2%, up by 0.5 point from last year. The year-over-year margin expansion is due primarily to volume leverage and a favorable contribution from price, partly offset by increased spending. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in both segments. Sequentially, operating earnings declined by about 5% and segment operating margin was 2 points lower. 
Last quarter, we talked about Q1 being an unusually strong margin quarter and we said that we expected lower operating margins in the balance of the year. All the factors we said would cause margins to be lower in the balance of the year came into play in the second quarter, and that was less favorable mix, the normal January wage and salary increases, other increased spending and less favorable impact from currency. 
As Keith pointed out, we're pleased with the first half performance, including margins. Segment operating margin for the first half was 18.2%, up 1.7 points compared to the first half of last year and with a related conversion margin of 42%. Although it's not shown on the slide, our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 30.5%. 
I'll turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q2 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales increased 7% year-over-year, reaching $665 million. Currency translation reduced sales by about 1 point. Sales increased 2% sequentially in the segment. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 25.2%, up 0.8 point from Q2 last year. And year-to-date, operating margin in Architecture & Software is 26.9%, up 2.2 points from last year.
On Slide 8, you'll see the results for our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to Q2 last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 1 point reduction due to currency and with particularly strong growth in the Solutions and services businesses. Sales increased 9% sequentially in Control Products & Solutions. 
Segment operating earnings were $101 million, with segment operating margin up 0.2 point from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.4 points compared to last year. 
Switching to the next slide. This is a look at regional sales performance. You can see here the growth rates by region, both as reported and excluding currency effects. Keith covered most of the regional highlights in his comments. So perhaps, I'll provide just a bit more color for EMEA. 
EMEA continue to deliver very good results with 12% currency-neutral growth. You can see that on the far right column. EMEA was the only region with a significant impact from acquisitions in the quarter. But excluding the effect of acquisitions, EMEA still had a very healthy 7% increase year-over-year. 
I'll turn now to Slide #10, the free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million, that's about 137% conversion on net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, and that includes the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter. We would expect conversion to be about 100% excluding the pension contribution. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. This slide provides a comparison of first half results to the full year guidance. Looking at the first half results, as I mentioned, we're pleased with the growth in sales, the margin performance and the EPS performance, and we're pretty much where we expected to be at the midyear point. 
As Keith mentioned, with 2 quarters behind us, we have narrowed the guidance. We now expect sales for the full year in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. That compares to the previous guidance of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. We expect currency translation to reduce sales by 2 points for the full year. Our previous guidance assumed a 1 point decrease due to currency. 
Last quarter, you may remember, we identified currency as a risk to the full year sales guidance. With another quarter of experience behind us, we're now building that into the guidance. Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of between 6% and 9%. Previous guidance was 5% to 9%. 
The $50 million drop at the top end of the sales range primarily reflects the increased negative impact due to currency. At the bottom end of the sales range, we're absorbing the negative currency impact, but increasing our expectation for full year organic growth by about one point. 
We still expect segment margin to be around 18%, probably a little better. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.40. The $0.05 reduction at the high end of the EPS range includes the more negative impact of currency. We continue to expect the full year tax rate of about 24%. 
And finally, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year. That's up from the previous guidance of $86 million, and the increase reflects the legacy environmental charges that were incurred in the Q2. 
And with that, I'll turn this back over to Rondi."

Tire has been a very strong market over the last, probably, 12 to 18 months now. While we're not seeing the growth there, tire is continuing to stay at the high level with just a little bit of shift of where and who's doing the investing, but the market itself continues to perform well. Oil and gas is strong pretty much across the board, and that is pretty much a continuation. Water wastewater, strong in the U.S. Mining, strong in Latin America, Canada and the South Africa, Middle East region for us, with respect to EMEA. The consumer products, consumer is a little bit mixed. When you look at it in total, the food and beverage market, a lot of the investment there is primarily in emerging markets as we go forward. Life sciences becoming a little stronger in EMEA. And then the one that's probably a little weaker within consumer is the home and personal care market at this point in time.

Then we also have the phenomenon between north and south. I'll call it Western Europe, if you will. The continuing debt crisis in the south impacting a little bit stronger into Spain and Italy now, and the north being more of the exporting region goes back to my earlier comments. And then the last point I'd make with respect to Europe would be that emerging aspects, which, for us, would be areas like Russia and Turkey, they continue to perform well in the second quarter, equally strong -- almost equally as strong as they were in our first quarter.

Well, certainly, let's take the near-end look and that's for the remainder of the year. We would expect Logix to grow at a growth rate above the company average, and that's certainly what we're planning on. With respect to penetration, that's a larger -- well, let me guess, and we expect to see a really solid high single, low double-digit growth rate for the year in Logix. As far as the penetration, we continue to expand the opportunities for Logix. So we have not -- and when I say that, I mean, we're expanding the served market for Logix, and that's what I talked about the new 2 controllers that came out. That's expanding the market that we have had -- that we cover going into OEMs, going in the process, the addition of safety, the addition of broader Ethernet capabilities, all of this is expanding the scalability, and therefore, the served market for Logix. So our penetration -- in one way, you can say it keeps going down because we keep expanding the market. So we believe we still have runway to grow Logix as we go forward, and certainly, that's one of the reasons we continue to invest in it, to be able to continue to expand the served market and, therefore, be able to continue to drive that higher growth that I talked about. And this year, for the first time, we expect Logix sales to be over $1 billion. So -- and we see no reason we can't continue to grow that above the company average into the -- certainly, the short and midterm future."

And certainly, we don't see it as a limitation from the standpoint of we continually grow and develop it. And we talked about it, particular in Process, one of the reasons we are growing at the rate we are is that we continue to expand the integrator network, and to your point, very much so in the emerging markets. And I think the challenge is more of finding competent, talented integrators in some of the emerging markets that can support the technology and have the domain expertise to grow into some of these new markets. So I think it's more the availability issue and having the competence to continue to expand. But we are constantly evolving and growing that partner network throughout the world."

Do they want to work with a local integrator, or do they want to work with a Rockwell Automation who can probably provide more commonality, more standardization globally than a local system integrator could. So we try to look at that as the best of both worlds and how do we balance the growth of local integrators versus continuing to expand our solutions capability and the domain expertise in the emerging markets."

I think the gap that we talked about is mainly because of the -- excuse me, that slow start we had, particularly in Asia in emerging markets, in our first quarter and the hole we dug with the expanded shipments we had in our fourth quarter last year. And as we rebuild that pipeline with orders, we're just seeing that order flow now come through in the second half of the year. So we're seeing some moderating in Product, but a normal expansion in our Solutions business. And we don't see that as an indication at this point yet of a movement towards end of cycle large projects in heavy industries. But the other part of that is, we're naturally growing our Process business. So we are seeing some of that as just the -- as far as just the natural evolution of our strategy as we go forward. So we would expect more larger projects, more in the heavy industries, particularly in the emerging markets, and some of that is just the natural evolution following our growth and performance strategy.

I'm sorry, this quarter, excuse me. And that was up from negative growth last quarter. What are we seeing that's different? Well, I think a couple of things. First, our team there is doing a very good job at uncovering new customers and new applications. And that does take a little bit of time, and that's why sometimes you get a dwell period, particularly when the economy is slowing. And we have seen that in China, and I think all of the statistics point to that, which is something that you've seen. As where are we seeing this now? I think we're starting to see some of the liquidity problems working their way through the system. We would hope that, that is going to be a continuing theme as we go through the year, which is why we believe the uptake will come up. And we see a split, really, between large customers and smaller customers yet. The larger companies are getting stronger and investing more. And we still see some of the pain at those smaller customers at this point, and that's really driven because of the liquidity problems that I talked about. The other reason we think we're going to see a better second half is our front-log activity has picked up, and that really goes back to the earlier comments I made about our sales organization is working very aggressively. We believe OEMs continue to be strong for us, to be able to create new OEM, to take time to work with them in the design phase and the design cycle. So we're expecting a pickup with OEMs as we go forward. And just the ongoing maturity of our distributors and our system integrators will help and should always help provide some tailwind as well. But that's a -- that's also a long-term process for us as well. So I think those would be the thoughts that we have with respect to China, both current, and why we feel we will expect to see an acceleration in the second half."

If you look at the PMI, depending upon which one you look at, the third-party one, which tends to be most of the multinationals, is still under 50% and has been under 50% for, I think, maybe 6 or more months now. So that tells you that manufacturing is slowing. If you look at the data that they communicate, they just recently lowered their growth rates another 0.5 point. And so their exports have been impacted to some degree. So I would say the majority of our success has been us working it as opposed to the continued growth or -- at a high level of -- while the growth rates are still strong, they're declining from where they were. So it isn't like the overall businesses is pulling us along with it. I think we're having to work harder, and we're having to create more of our opportunities and grow more customers. And that's why I'm complimenting our team in China because it's -- while that might have been stronger market growth previously, we have certainly strong growth, but our performance, I think, indicates that the team is outperforming the underlying market there as well."

Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year, as well as some full year outlook commentary. Then Ted will provide more details around the second quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2012, and we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. 
We know it's been a busy earnings week for all of you, so we appreciate you dialing in today. We expect the call to take about an hour, maybe a little bit less. 
As is always the case on these calls, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.
So with that, I'll hand over the call to Keith."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover some highlights for the quarter and a summary of our performance",827,"Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover some highlights for the quarter and a summary of our performance in the first half of the year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. We had solid 8% growth excluding currency in Q2 and 7% organic growth. 
I was really pleased to see solid organic growth in every region. North American market conditions have remained healthy. Our reported sales growth in the U.S. was 5% this quarter. But because of an unusually large project that shipped in quarter 2 last year, we believe that understates the strength of market conditions in the U.S. If we carved that large project out, growth in the U.S. would have been several points higher. Canada was a standout with 25% growth. We are successfully capitalizing on the strength of resource-based industries there. 
Europe had another strong quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. Our team there is executing very well in a difficult environment. 
I was encouraged to see Asia return to double-digit growth in the quarter. China improved to high single-digit growth, and we are optimistic that market conditions will continue to improve in the second half of the year. Our outlook for India is more cautious. Sales in India were flat in the quarter, and we have yet to see evidence of improvement in the economy. 
Lastly, while Latin America organic sales were only up 4% in the quarter, they have difficult comparison to a great quarter last year. Orders were strong in the quarter, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. I hope that regional color was helpful. I have a few other second quarter highlights to share before I move on to the first half. 
Our Process business continued to gain traction and delivered another quarter of over 20% sales growth. We continue to expand our integrator network, which is enabling us to pursue a broader spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity, and we are executing well. We introduced 2 new Logix mid-range controller platforms that improved scalability and Ethernet connectivity, plus enhanced motion for our OEM customers. 
For the fourth time, we were recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. This award is a real tribute to the efforts of all of our employees and the importance of ethics in our culture. 
Ted will provide more detail on second quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'd like to provide a few highlights on the first half of the fiscal year. 
I am pleased with our year-over-year performance through the end of March. Sales grew over 8%, excluding currency. Operating margin expanded 1.7 points, and segment conversion margin was over 40%. Earnings per share in the first half grew 12% in spite of a pretty significant headwind from taxes, and we continue to generate best-in-class return on invested capital. 
So far, the year has played out a little differently than we thought it would. Developed markets have been a bit stronger and emerging markets weaker than we originally expected. But overall, at the halfway point of the year, we're pretty much where we expected to be, and we're well positioned as we enter the second half. 
So this is how we're thinking about the second half. We expect sequential sales growth in all regions and across our Product & Solutions and services businesses. We had a good first half in developed markets, and we expect those markets to remain solid for the rest of the year. 
In emerging markets, we expect stronger growth in the second half of the year. Our outlook for China and Latin America is strong. We expect to return to double-digit growth in the second half. But we are more cautious on India, as we have yet to see signs of economic improvement there.
Despite some mixed signals in the macro environment, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. 
With 2 quarters behind us and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we are maintaining the midpoint of both our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year and narrowing the ranges. The narrowed range for earnings per share guidance is $5.10 to $5.40. Sales and earnings within our guidance ranges would represent another record year for the company. Ted will provide more color on the assumptions in our guidance in his remarks. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. We are executing our growth and performance strategy well, and that will enable us to deliver superior returns to our share owners. 
With that, I'll now hand it over to Ted."

I'll be referencing the slides on the website, and I'll start with Slide #5, which is titled Second Quarter Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,561,000,000, up 7% compared to the second q",1125,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody out there. I'll be referencing the slides on the website, and I'll start with Slide #5, which is titled Second Quarter Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,561,000,000, up 7% compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 1 point, and the contribution from acquisitions increased sales by about 1 point. 
Segment operating earnings were $268 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago. General corporate net was $25.1 million compared to $20.5 million in Q2 last year. The increase was due to a $7 million legacy environmental charge related to former Rockwell International sites. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.9%. 
Diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up a bit from last year. While we had a reasonable increase in segment operating earnings, the combination of our legacy environmental charge and a higher tax rate reduced EPS by about $0.13. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 144.7 million, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 508,000 shares at a cost of about $41 million. 
Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the second quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q2 was 7%. Sales increased by 6% sequentially. 
On the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings were $268 million, up 10% compared to Q2 last year, with segment operating margin at 17.2%, up by 0.5 point from last year. The year-over-year margin expansion is due primarily to volume leverage and a favorable contribution from price, partly offset by increased spending. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in both segments. Sequentially, operating earnings declined by about 5%, and segment operating margin was 2 points lower. 
Last quarter, we talked about Q1 being an unusually strong margin quarter, and we said that we expected lower operating margins in the balance of the year. All the factors we said would cause margins to be lower in the balance of the year came into play in the second quarter, and that was less favorable mix, the normal January wage and salary increases, other increased spending and less favorable impact from currency. 
As Keith pointed out, we're pleased with the first half performance, including margins. Segment operating margin for the first half was 18.2%, up 1.7 points compared to the first half of last year and with a related conversion margin of 42%. Although it's not shown on the slide, our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 30.5%. 
I'll turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q2 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales increased 7% year-over-year, reaching $665 million. Currency translation reduced sales by about 1 point. Sales increased 2% sequentially in the segment. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 25.2%, up 0.8 point from Q2 last year. And year-to-date, operating margin in Architecture & Software is 26.9%, up 2.2 points from last year.
On Slide 8, you'll see the results for our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to Q2 last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 1-point reduction due to currency and with particularly strong growth in the Solutions and services businesses. Sales increased 9% sequentially in Control Products & Solutions. 
Segment operating earnings were $101 million, with segment operating margin up 0.2 point from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.4 points compared to last year. 
Switching to the next slide. This is a look at regional sales performance. You can see here the growth rates by region, both as reported and excluding currency effects. Keith covered most of the regional highlights in his comments. So perhaps, I'll provide just a bit more color for EMEA. 
EMEA continued to deliver very good results with 12% currency-neutral growth. You can see that in the far right column. EMEA was the only region with a significant impact from acquisitions in the quarter. But excluding the effect of acquisitions, EMEA still had a very healthy 7% increase year-over-year. 
I'll turn now to Slide #10, the free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million. That's about 137% conversion on net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, and that includes the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter. We would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. 
And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. This slide provides a comparison of first half results to the full year guidance. Looking at the first half results, as I mentioned, we're pleased with the growth in sales, the margin performance and the EPS performance, and we're pretty much where we expected to be at the midyear point. 
As Keith mentioned, with 2 quarters behind us, we have narrowed the guidance. We now expect sales for the full year in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. That compares to the previous guidance of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. We expect currency translation to reduce sales by 2 points for the full year. Our previous guidance assumed a 1-point decrease due to currency. 
Last quarter, you may remember, we identified currency as a risk to the full year sales guidance. With another quarter of experience behind us, we're now building that into the guidance. Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of between 6% and 9%. Previous guidance was 5% to 9%. 
The $50 million drop at the top end of the sales range primarily reflects the increased negative impact due to currency. At the bottom end of the sales range, we're absorbing the negative currency impact but increasing our expectation for full year organic growth by about 1 point. 
We still expect segment margin to be around 18%, probably a little better. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.40. The $0.05 reduction at the high end of the EPS range includes the more negative impact of currency. We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. 
And finally, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year. That's up from the previous guidance of $86 million, and the increase reflects the legacy environmental charges that were incurred in Q2. 
And with that, I'll turn this back over to Rondi."

Then we also have the phenomenon between north and south, I'll call it, Western Europe, if you will. The continuing debt crisis in the south impacting a little bit stronger into Spain and Italy now, and the north being more of the exporting region goes back to my earlier comments. And then the last point I'd make with respect to Europe would be that emerging aspects, which, for us, would be areas like Russia and Turkey, they continue to perform well in the second quarter, equally strong -- almost equally as strong as they were in our first quarter. So we see continued growth there, and then the Western Europe would be back to the earlier comments I made."

That is very similar to what we talk about in the oil and gas segment, being refining, the bulk chemical projects. The majority of our applications there and where we do have and where we are capable and will participate is in the intelligent motor control aspects of that business, with our medium-voltage drives and motor control centers and our safety systems from a process standpoint. And there, we will become a significant participant and to work with the companies that are starting that up, that are talking about those new facilities.

I'm sorry, this quarter, excuse me. And that was up from negative growth last quarter. What are we seeing that's different? Well, I think a couple of things. First, our team there is doing a very good job at uncovering new customers and new applications. And that does take a little bit of time, and that's why sometimes you get a dwell period, particularly when the economy is slowing. And we have seen that in China, and I think all of the statistics point to that, which is something that you've seen. As where are we seeing this now? I think we're starting to see some of the liquidity problems working their way through the system. We would hope that, that is going to be a continuing theme as we go through the year, which is why we believe the uptake will come up. And we see a split, really, between large customers and smaller customers yet. The larger companies are getting stronger and investing more. And we still see some of the pain at those smaller customers at this point, and that's really driven because of the liquidity problems that I talked about. The other reason we think we're going to see a better second half is our front-log activity has picked up, and that really goes back to the earlier comment I made about our sales organization is working very aggressively. We believe OEMs continue to be strong for us. To be able to create new OEMs, it takes time to work with them in the design phase and the design cycle. So we're expecting a pickup with OEMs as we go forward. And just the ongoing maturity of our distributors and our system integrators will help and should always help provide some tailwind as well. But that's a -- that's also a long-term process for us as well. So I think those would be the thoughts that we have with respect to China, both current, and why we feel we will expect to see an acceleration in the second half."

If you look at the PMI, depending upon which one you look at, the third-party one, which tends to be most of the multinationals, is still under 50% and has been under 50% for, I think, maybe 6 or more months now. So that tells you that manufacturing is slowing. If you look at the data that they communicate, they just recently lowered their growth rates another 0.5 point. And so their exports have been impacted to some degree. So I would say the majority of our success has been us working it as opposed to the continued growth or -- at a high level of -- while the growth rates are still strong, they're declining from where they were. So it isn't like the overall business is pulling us along with it. I think we're having to work harder, and we're having to create more of our opportunities and grow more customers.

We delivered solid 7% organic growth in the third quarter with organic growth in all region. Operating margin expanded almost 1 point and earnings per share grew 9% or 13%, if you exclude the headwind from a higher tax rate. So overall, a good quarter in the midst of a more challenging macroeconomic environment.
Let me give you some color on sales in the quarter.
Generally, all regions came in at the lower end of our growth rate expectation, reflecting a slowing of market demand. The U.S. was stable, with 6% organic growth, and Canada had another robust quarter of 24% growth.
EMEA held up reasonably well with 3% organic growth in spite of deteriorating macroeconomic condition. While parts of Western Europe declined in the quarter, the emerging EMEA had very strong double-digit growth. 
In Asia, we actually saw stronger growth in mature countries than in emerging. While China did grow sequentially, 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter was below our expectation. The government's stimulus action have yet to jumpstart economic growth. We continue to believe that China will rebound to higher growth rate, but it now appears more likely to happen after our Q4.
India remained weak and sales were down in the quarter. We have yet to see evidence of improvement in their economy. 
Lastly, Latin America organic sales growth of 5% in the quarter fell considerably short of our expectation. Most of the sales shortfall was in Brazil, which is experiencing an economic slowdown and has led to delays in customer spending. Mexico, on the other hand, was a bright spot, with over 30% growth. 
I have a few other third quarter highlights. Our process business delivered another good quarter of sales growth at 15%. On a year-to-date basis, sales are up 20% in process. In June, the Board approved a new 1 billion share repurchase authorization and we increased the dividend by 11%. Both of these actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
Ted will provide more detail on third quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'll move on to our revised outlook.
Every quarter, we do an extensive review with our sales and business leaders, as well as a pulse check with our channel partners and key customers to try to get a read on current and future business condition. Although none of us has a crystal ball, we use this feedback, along with macro indicators and our recent performance, to develop our outlook for the remainder of the year. So what is all of this telling us? 
On the macroeconomic side, whether you look at GDP, industrial production growth or PMI, most of the indicators have weakened from one quarter ago. Customer and channel sentiment is generally less positive than one quarter ago. Most of the signs point to a flattening of cluster demand, at least in the short term. And although sales growth was solid in Q3, we started to see more projects getting pushed out. While there are project delays in every quarter, they seem to pick up in the third quarter.
So keeping all of this in mind, along with an increasing headwind of currency, we are reducing our sales outlook for the fiscal year to about $6.2 billion. Correspondingly, we are revising our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance range to $5 to $5.20, with about $0.05 of the reduction coming from currency. Even with the guidance revision, sales and earnings in this range represents another record year for the company.
It is clear that we are in an environment of considerable macroeconomic and political uncertainty. We are closely monitoring market condition and are focused on how the fourth quarter will play out. We have proven we know how to be nimble in times of economic uncertainty and will continue to balance near-term financial performance with growth opportunity.
At the end of the day, automation remains a great market, and our competitive differentiation positions us well to outgrow the underlying market. This historical cyclical patterns have any relevant, we would expect to see at least another 2 years in the cycle. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and domain expertise is core to our value proposition per customer. That is what will enable us to continue to gain market share and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2012. Ted?"
300504,213996641,330044,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000, that's up 3% compared to the third quarter of l",1107,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000, that's up 3% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 4 points. That's a much more negative impact from currency than earlier this year and more negative than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The decline of the euro compared to the U.S. dollars causing the largest part of that difference.
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago. General Corporate net was $90 million, that compares to $22.3 million in Q3 last year. This Q3 was somewhat lower than average quarter for General Corporate net expense, primarily just timing. We still expect the full year General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.1%. There were some discreet items that reduced the rate in the quarter. Year-to-date, the effective rate was 23.8%. So through 9 months, we're running very close to our full year expectation of 24%. Last year in Q3, the tax rate was 19.1%, also lower due to the recognition of discreet items.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.33, up $0.09 compared to Q3 last year. And despite the higher tax rate, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.5 million, that's down about 2.4 million shares from the average of Q3 last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million of shares at a cost of about $121 million. Year-to-date, through the end of June, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of about $170 million.
The increased rate of repurchases in Q3 is generally consistent with the intentions that we outlined in the earnings call at the end of April. 
Moving to Slide 6, this is a more graphical representation of total company results for the third quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q3 was 3%, 7% ex-currency. Reported sales were flat sequentially, but up about 1 point, excluding currency translation.
On the right side of the slide, you can see a healthy increase in segment operating earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially. Segment operating margin was 18.2% in the quarter, up 0.08 points compared to last year and up 1 point sequentially. The year-over-year margin expansion reflects volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending an unfavorable mix. We also benefited in Q3 from lower incentive compensation expense, including year-to-date adjustments related to reduced expectations for full year sales and earnings. It's a similar year-over-year margin cost in each of the segments.
Through 3 quarters, segment operating margin is 18.2%, up 1.4 points from the same 9 months of last year. 
Let's move to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q3 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales were $664 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by about 4 points, so organic sales growth was approximately 3%. Sales were flat sequentially.
Operating margin for the quarter was 27.5%, up 1.4 points compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date operating margin in Architecture & Software is 27.1 points or 27.1%, up almost 2 points from the same period last year.
Let's turn to slide 8, results for the Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales were $897 million in the quarter, up 6% compared to Q3 last year. The increase included about one point contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 5-point reduction due to currency. So an organic sales increase of 10%. 
Solutions and services businesses grew about 16% organically year-over-year, contributing the lion share of the dollar growth. Sales in this segment were flat sequentially. Segment operating earnings were $102 million, an increase of 16% compared to Q3 last year, with segment operating margin at 11.3%, up almost a full point from a year ago.
Year-to-date, control products and solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.3 points compared to last year.
The next slide provides a look at regional sales performance. Keith provided a good deal of color on the regional sales performance, so I won't repeat that. Perhaps just a couple of comments. 
Looking at the difference between the growth rates in the middle column, that's the at reported year-over-year comparison and far right column, which is ex-currency. You'll note that significant negative impact from currency, particularly in EMEA and Latin America, and the largest impact in Latin America coming from Brazil. 
In EMEA, with ex-currency growth of 5%, we benefited from about a 2-point contribution from acquisitions year-over-year. And to reinforce a point that Keith made maybe the most positive message from this slide is the organic growth in all regions.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $232 million, that's about 122% of net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in quarter one. We would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding that pension contribution.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for the full year. As Keith mentioned, we'll reduce the narrowed sales and earnings guidance. We now expect sales for the full year of about $6.2 billion. Think of that as a range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion, and that compares to the previous guidance of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. We now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3 points for the full year, previous guidance assumed a 2-point decrease due to currency. Across the sales guidance range, there's about a $50 million negative impact from currency compared to the prior guidance.
Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of about 6% to 7%, previous guidance was 6% to 9%. We still expect segment margin to be a little over 18%. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date. And we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20. 
As Keith mentioned, currency effects are reducing EPS across the guidance range by about $0.05 compared to the prior guidance.
We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

In the U.S., we are seeing some project, I'll say, really front log pushouts, particularly in paper and metals. The ongoing small project business is good in the U.S. So little difference there in the fact that it's really the front log of pushout that we're seeing. Probably, where the most significant changes are occurring, and all of this is based upon our expectations where, in particular in Asia, we were expecting to see some acceleration of projects in the second half of the year, and that's not occurring. And so we're seeing both backlog and frontlog pushouts in projects in Asia. We associate a lot of that with just the market conditions, the macroeconomic conditions, mainly in China and India, and the liquidity issues in both of those countries as well. And it just, in particular in China, we weren't expecting anything in India. But in China, we thought we would see that deceleration, and in fact, we have not. So from our expectation, it's been lower, even though we had growth in China. In Latin America, probably the biggest impact is what we're seeing in Brazil, and that's not so much -- in Latin America, it's not so much in the large projects, such as the oil and gas and mining projects, which tend to be very long-term investments, and those don't really move much at the end of the day. It's more in the shorter-term projects, particularly in Brazil, where there's struggling with both the high interest rates and also the real currency that is making some of their exporting manufacturing less competitive. So that tends to be a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the project delays as we go forward."

There's not really a slowdown with respect to particularly oil and gas has been very strong. And also, some of the metals markets in the Middle East continue to be strong. And once again, these are generally large projects that don't get moved simply because of a short-term issue. They tend to be longer-term, decade type investments, and they tend to continue to move forward. And we haven't seen any delay in that. In Europe, the delay is more of it has been able, what I will call, some of the consumer industries, auto, as all of you know, is struggling more in Europe with the overcapacity. You've seen recent print -- recent articles about the taking off-line of some of their capacity. And so we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown there. But Europe, in automotive, is probably not as strong for us as any other region in the world. So it's probably less of an impact to us. But along that line, tire goes pretty close with automotive, and we're seeing slowdowns there, which does impact some of the OEM activity in Europe. And then food and beverage, the consumer products areas are also starting to see more slowdown and pushouts of projects. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the European front."

And so, obviously, the most recent memory that we have is the, back in '08. And I think there's some meaningful differences than what we saw at that point in time. For example, back in '08, we had, at least in the U.S., we had 2 major car companies on the verge of bankruptcy. We had a very strong bubble in the housing sector, and we were getting close to but not yet in the financial crisis that occurred later in the fall. And at this point, and today, we don't see any of those. And more importantly, most company's balance sheets are very strong. So they have an ability to, I think, ease your right through a slowdown and yet continue to spend in the appropriate areas if that makes sense. So we really aren't, at this point, seen similarities to '08 other than what we talked about earlier, which is there is some project delays.

But certainly, given the macro and political environment, at this point, we feel that that's just a normal course of action that we would expect company to be taking. So we're obviously very focused on Q4 and to get a better read of what's occurring, and that's one of the reasons we want to be careful with our spending at this point in time. But we're still expecting growth, and we are expecting that the cycle will continue, although we don't know the shape of it at this point in time."

And certainly, what we're seeing in July is consistent with what we've outlined in the guidance. So really, no fundamental change other than the slowing of growth, particularly in some of the key emerging markets that we didn't anticipate. We talked about China accelerating. We're not seeing anything unique in India that we did expect. But China, not as faster growth than we covered it. And Brazil, in a  worse situation than we would have -- than we certainly had anticipated in the previous quarters. So other than those new ones, not new ones, those areas, in general, just a slowing and just the rate of increase was different than we anticipated at the start of the quarter."

There is a selling cycle. There is a build cycle that has to come in to play and an order cycle that comes into that as well. So we wouldn't see that quick of a reaction. We believe that the performance in Europe is really because of what we've done the last couple of years to build and to focus on OEMs. And in particular, the success we see is good and less by the currency and more by the strength of exporting OEMs. And certainly, if you look at the performance of the machine rebuilders in Europe, the domestic market is very weak, and what has been supporting it the last couple of quarters, supporting the industry in the last couple of quarters, has been exporting. And exporting to the U.S. and exporting to Latin America with a somewhat of a decline in the exports. Asia, particularly China, and the domestic market has weakened. So it's played to our strength. And more importantly, played to the areas that we focused on in the last couple of years. And we believe that's been one of the areas that we've been able to create share gains and one of the reasons why we've been able to continue to grow in a very, very difficult economy there."

But more importantly, that's what gives us the competitive differentiation. And quite frankly, it's one of the reasons we came out of the last downturn as strong as we did. So we want to make sure we continue to maintain the proper investment levels and deal with the current economic situation appropriately, but not at the expense of prolonging the recoveries and the benefits of new products and new customers in the upturn. And quite frankly, we never experienced the speed and depth of the decline that we saw in 2009.

And we see it across many regions with the exception of EMEA. The heavy industries, there, we would expect to see some performance flattening. We think oil and gas will maintain the strength that it has. But as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some forward sentiment in metals and mining that appears to be more cautious now than it was previously, although we don't see that as a big impact in Q4.

And the other area was simply the liquidity issue. Many small midsized customers, distributors, system integrators. It was tough for them to get money.

And certainly, we think emerging markets is where we will again see ongoing spending for capacity expansion and new investments, then I should say new capacity, simply because of the ongoing expansion of the economy, as well as the growing middle-class and disposable income.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. My remarks will cover highlights for the quarter, our assessment of business condition and an updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck.
We delivered solid 7% organic growth in the third quarter with organic growth in all region. Operating margin expanded almost 1 point and the earnings per share grew 9% or 13%, if you exclude the headwind from a higher tax rate. So overall, a good quarter in the midst of a more challenging macroeconomic environment.
Let me give you some color on sales in the quarter.
Generally, all regions came in at the lower end of our growth rate expectation, reflecting a slowing of market demand. The U.S. was stable, with 6% organic growth, and Canada had another robust quarter of 24% growth.
EMEA held up reasonably well with 3% organic growth in spite of deteriorating macroeconomic condition. While parts of Western Europe declined in the quarter, emerging EMEA had very strong double-digit growth. 
In Asia, we actually saw a stronger growth in mature countries than in emerging. While China did grow sequentially, 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter was below our expectation. The government's stimulus action have yet to jumpstart economic growth. We continue to believe that China will rebound to higher growth rate, but it now appears more likely to happen after our Q4.
India remained weak and sales were down in the quarter. We have yet to see evidence of improvement in their economy. 
Lastly, Latin America organic sales growth of 5% in the quarter fell considerably short of our expectation. Most of the sales shortfall was in Brazil, which is experiencing an economic slowdown and has led to delays in customer spending. Mexico, on the other hand, was a bright spot, with over 30% growth. 
I have a few other third quarter highlights. Our Process business delivered another good quarter of sales growth at 15%. On a year-to-date basis, sales are up 20% in Process. In June, the board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we increased the dividend by 11%. Both of these actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
Ted will provide more detail on third quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'll move on to our revised outlook.
Every quarter, we do an extensive review with our sales and business leaders, as well as a pulse check with our channel partners and key customers to try to get a read on current and future business condition. Although none of us has a crystal ball, we use this feedback, along with macro indicators and our recent performance, to develop our outlook for the remainder of the year. So what is all of this telling us? 
On the macroeconomic side, whether you look at GDP, industrial production growth or PMI, most of the indicators have weakened from 1 quarter ago. Customer and channel sentiment is generally less positive than 1 quarter ago. Most of the signs point to a flattening of cluster demand, at least, in the short term. And although sales growth was solid in Q3, we started to see more projects getting pushed out. While there are project delays in every quarter, they seemed to pick up in the third quarter.
So keeping all of this in mind, along with an increasing headwind of currency, we are reducing our sales outlook for the fiscal year to about $6.2 billion. Correspondingly, we are revising our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance range to $5 to $5.20, with about $0.05 of the reduction coming from currency. Even with the guidance revision, sales and earnings in this range represents another record year for the company.
It is clear that we are in an environment of considerable macroeconomic and political uncertainty. We are closely monitoring market condition and are focused on how the fourth quarter will play out. We have proven we know how to be nimble in times of economic uncertainty and will continue to balance near-term financial performance with growth opportunity.
At the end of the day, automation remains a great market, and our competitive differentiation positions us well to outgrow the underlying market. This historical cyclical patterns have any relevance, we would expect to see at least another 2 years in this cycle. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and domain expertise is core to our value proposition for customers. That is what will enable us to continue to gain market share and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2012. Ted?"
300504,213996641,330305,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000, that's up 3% compared to the third quarter of l",1111,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000, that's up 3% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 4 points. That's a much more negative impact from currency than earlier this year and more negative than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The decline of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar is causing the largest part of that difference.
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago. General Corporate net was $19 million, that compares to $22.3 million in Q3 last year. This Q3 was somewhat lower than average quarter for General Corporate net expense, primarily just timing. We still expect the full year General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.1%. There were some discreet items that reduced the rate in the quarter. Year-to-date, the effective rate was 23.8%. So through 9 months, we're running very close to our full year expectation of 24%. Last year in Q3, the tax rate was 19.1%, also lower due to the recognition of discreet items.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.33, up $0.09 compared to Q3 last year. And despite the higher tax rate, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.5 million, that's down about $2.4 million shares from the average of Q3 last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million of shares at a cost of about $121 million. Year-to-date, through the end of June, we've repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of about $170 million.
The increased rate of repurchases in Q3 is generally consistent with the intentions that we outlined in the earnings call at the end of April. 
Moving to Slide 6, this is a more graphical representation of total company results for the third quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q3 was 3%, 7% ex currency. Reported sales were flat sequentially, but up about 1 point, excluding currency translation.
On the right side of the slide, you can see a healthy increase in segment operating earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially. Segment operating margin was 18.2% in the quarter, up 0.8 points compared to last year and up 1 point sequentially. The year-over-year margin expansion reflects volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending and unfavorable mix. We also benefited in Q3 from lower incentive compensation expense, including year-to-date adjustments related to reduced expectations for full year sales and earnings. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in each of the segments.
Through 3 quarters, segment operating margin is 18.2%, up 1.4 points from the same 9 months of last year. 
Let's move to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q3 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales were $664 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by about 4 points, so organic sales growth was approximately 3%. Sales were flat sequentially.
Operating margin for the quarter was 27.5%, up 1.4 points compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date operating margin in Architecture & Software is 27.1 points -- or 27.1%, up almost 2 points from the same period last year.
Let's turn to Slide 8 results for the Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales were $897 million in the quarter, up 6% compared to Q3 last year. The increase included about 1 point contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 5-point reduction due to currency. So an organic sales increase of 10%. 
Solutions and services businesses grew about 16% organically year-over-year, contributing the lion's share of the dollar growth. Sales in this segment were flat sequentially. Segment operating earnings were $102 million, an increase of 16% compared to Q3 last year, with segment operating margin at 11.3%, up almost a full point from a year ago.
Year-to-date, Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.3 points compared to last year.
The next slide provides a look at regional sales performance. Keith provided a good deal of color on the regional sales performance, so I won't repeat that. Perhaps just a couple of comments. 
Looking at the difference between the growth rates in the middle column, that's the as reported year-over-year comparison and in far right column, which is ex-currency, you'll note the significant negative impact from currency, particularly in EMEA and Latin America, and the largest impact in Latin America coming from Brazil. 
In EMEA, with ex-currency growth at 5%, we benefited from about a 2-point contribution from acquisitions year-over-year. And to reinforce a point that Keith made, maybe the most positive message from this slide is the organic growth in all regions.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $232 million, that's about 122% of net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in quarter 1. We would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding that pension contribution.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for the full year. As Keith mentioned, we've reduced the narrowed sales and earnings guidance. We now expect sales for the full year of about $6.2 billion. Think of that as a range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion, and that compares to the previous guidance of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. We now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3 points for the full year. Previous guidance assumed a 2-point decrease due to currency. Across the sales guidance range, there's about a $50 million negative impact from currency compared to the prior guidance.
Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of about 6% to 7%, previous guidance was 6% to 9%. We still expect segment margin to be a little over 18%. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date. And we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20. As Keith mentioned, currency effects are reducing EPS across the guidance range by about $0.05 compared to the prior guidance.
We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

Even though reported sales were down slightly, there was positive organic growth, and that had some attractive conversion. We also had somewhat better mix sequentially. We talked about the unfavorable mix in Q2. And the incentive comp that I mentioned also favorably impacted margin sequentially a bit. So I mean, that kind of explains the A&S margin performance in the quarter. As it relates to incrementals in Q4, especially when you get small sales changes and negative changes, the incrementals start to get a little funky. But basically, I would say, if you think about the sequential performance from Q3 to Q4, that we're going to get a little bit -- at mid-point, a little bit of organic volume growth. And that's going to be offset largely by unfavorable mix."

In the U.S., we are seeing some project, I'll say, really front-log pushouts, particularly in paper and metals. The ongoing small project business is good in the U.S. So little different there in the fact that it's really the front-log pushout that we're seeing. Probably, where the most significant changes are occurring, and all of this is based upon our expectations where, in particular, in Asia, we were expecting to see some acceleration of projects in the second half of the year, and that's not occurring. And so we're seeing both backlog and front-log pushouts in projects in Asia. We associate a lot of that with just the market conditions, the macroeconomic conditions, mainly in China and India, and the liquidity issues in both of those countries as well. And it just -- in particular in China, we weren't expecting anything in India. But in China, we thought we would see that deceleration, and in fact, we have not. So from our expectation, it's been lower, even though we had growth in China. In Latin America, probably the biggest impact is what we're seeing in Brazil, and that's not so much -- in Latin America, it's not so much in the large projects, such as the oil and gas and the mining projects, which tend to be very long-term investments, and those don't really move much at the end of the day. It's more in the shorter-term projects, particularly, in Brazil, where they're struggling with both the high interest rates and also the real currency that is making some of their exporting, manufacturing less competitive. So that tends to be a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the project delays as we go forward here."

I mean, it's 3%. But the fact that we're still growing in a very, very tough environment is very encouraging for us, and we're very pleased with the team's work there to make this happen. We are seeing the slowdown in Western Europe. Some of the countries are seeing a much more difficult environment. As you would expect, Southern Europe is -- it's tougher than it was in the earlier part of the year. But we are seeing the growth in emerging Europe, and we see projects continuing to be moving forward. There's not really a slowdown with respect to -- particularly, oil and gas has been very strong. And also, some of the metals markets in the Middle East continue to be strong. And once again, these are generally large projects that don't get moved simply because of a short-term issue. They tend to be longer-term, decade-type investments, and they tend to continue to move forward. And we haven't seen any delay in that. In Europe, the delay is -- more of it has been in, what I would call, some of the consumer industries. Auto, as all of you know, is struggling more in Europe with the overcapacity. You've seen recent print -- recent articles about the taking offline of some of their capacity. And so we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown there. But Europe, in automotive, is probably not as strong for us as any other region in the world. So it's probably less of an impact to us. But along that line, tire goes pretty close with automotive, and we're seeing slowdowns there, which does impact some of the OEM activity in Europe. And then food and beverage, the consumer products areas are also starting to see more slowdown and pushout of projects. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the European front."

But certainly for us, this feels more like a pause and a slowing of growth as opposed to a fundamental downturn at this point in time. And so, obviously, the most recent memory that we have is the -- back in '08. And I think there's some meaningful differences than what we saw at that point in time. For example, back in '08, we had, at least, in the U.S., we had 2 major car companies on the verge of bankruptcy. We had a very strong bubble in the housing sector, and we were getting close to but not yet in the financial crisis that occurred later in the fall. And at this point -- and today, we don't see any of those. And more importantly, most companies' balance sheets are very strong. So they have an ability to, I think, ease you right through a slowdown and yet continue to spend in the appropriate areas if that makes sense. So we really aren't, at this point, seeing similarities to '08 other than what we talked about earlier, which is there are some project delays. And while a lot of that is normal, we did see a little push-up of that, a push-up of that in the third quarter. But certainly, given the macro and political environment, at this point, we just feel that that's just a normal course of action that we would expect companies to be taking. So we're obviously very focused on Q4 and to get a better read of what's occurring, and that's one of the reasons we want to be careful with our spending at this point in time. But we're still expecting growth, and we are expecting that the cycle will continue, although we don't know the shape of it at this point in time."

And certainly, what we're seeing in July is consistent with what we've outlined in the guidance. So really, no fundamental change other than the slowing of growth, particularly in some of the key emerging markets that we did anticipate. We talked about China accelerating. We're not seeing anything unique in India that we didn't expect. But China, not as faster growth than we covered it. And Brazil, in a  worse situation than we would have -- than we certainly had anticipated in the previous quarters.

There is a selling cycle. There is a build cycle that has to come in to play and an order cycle that comes into that as well. So we wouldn't see that quick of a reaction. We believe that the performance in Europe is really because of what we've done in the last couple of years to build and to focus on OEMs. And in particular, the success we see is driven less by the currency and more by the strength of exporting OEMs. And certainly, if you look at the performance of the machine rebuilders in Europe, the domestic market is very weak, and what has been supporting it in the last couple of quarters -- supporting the industry in the last couple of quarters has been exporting. And exporting to the U.S. and exporting to Latin America with a somewhat of a decline in the exports. Asia, particularly China, and the domestic market has weakened. So it's played to our strength, and more importantly, played to the areas that we focused on in the last couple of years.

So we want to make sure we continue to maintain the proper investment levels and deal with the current economic situation appropriately, but not at the expense of prolonging the recovery and the benefits of new products and new customers in the upturn.

And if you look at the one that probably grew below the Rockwell average, it would have been the consumer industries on a global basis. As far as the outlook, we would expect transportation, in particular, auto, to continue to be a healthy grower. And we like the front log that we see in transportation and particularly, automotive. And we see it across many regions with the exception of EMEA. The heavy industries there, we would expect to see some performance flattening. We think oil and gas will maintain the strength that it has. But as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some forward sentiment in metals and mining that appears to be more cautious now than it was previously, although we don't see that as a big impact in Q4. And then the consumer is basically flat. We think the spending there is really focused in emerging markets and then process optimization in some of the mature markets.

And so I think, as far where were the areas that we saw the softness, well, I think, for the quarter, it was really in a couple of activities. And the most important was probably the stimulus did not ramp up or did not get executed as fast as we thought, particularly in some of the municipal projects, which tend to be the area they go to quickly to drive investment and improve spending. And the other area was simply the liquidity issue. Many small, mid-sized customers, distributors, system integrators, it was tough for them to get money.

So we think safety, we think compliance, we think cost reduction and productivity plays very well in a slowing economy. And certainly, we think emerging markets is where we will, again, see ongoing spending for capacity expansion and new investments and, I should say, new capacity, simply because of the ongoing expansion of the economy, as well as the growing middle-class and disposable income. And certainly, if you look at historical, the '06 to '08 period, we still grew at an average of 7.5%. So we -- I think we believe we can outgrow the market. And if it's a slower growth environment, we still expect to be able to grow at a faster pace. And quite candidly, that's, I think, one of the beauties of the automation market. It's an area and an industry that companies need what we do, not just in good times, but in bad times as well.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. My remarks will cover highlights for the quarter, our assessment of business conditions and an updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck.
We delivered solid 7% organic growth in the third quarter with organic growth in all regions. Operating margin expanded almost 1 point, and the earnings per share grew 9% or 13%, if you exclude the headwind from a higher tax rate. So overall, a good quarter in the midst of a more challenging macroeconomic environment.
Let me give you some color on sales in the quarter.
Generally, all regions came in at the lower end of our growth rate expectation, reflecting a slowing of market demand. The U.S. was stable, with 6% organic growth, and Canada had another robust quarter of 24% growth.
EMEA held up reasonably well with 3% organic growth in spite of deteriorating macroeconomic condition. While parts of Western Europe declined in the quarter, emerging EMEA had very strong double-digit growth. 
In Asia, we actually saw stronger growth in mature countries than in emerging. While China did grow sequentially, 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter was below our expectation. The government's stimulus actions have yet to jump start economic growth. We continue to believe that China will rebound to higher growth rate, but it now appears more likely to happen after our Q4.
India remained weak, and sales were down in the quarter. We have yet to see evidence of improvement in their economy. 
Lastly, Latin America organic sales growth of 5% in the quarter fell considerably short of our expectation. Most of the sales shortfall was in Brazil, which is experiencing an economic slowdown and has led to delays in customer spending. Mexico, on the other hand, was a bright spot, with over 30% growth. 
I have a few other third quarter highlights. Our Process business delivered another good quarter of sales growth at 15%. On a year-to-date basis, sales are up 20% in Process. In June, the board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we increased the dividend by 11%. Both of these actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
Ted will provide more detail on third quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'll move on to our revised outlook.
Every quarter, we do an extensive review with our sales and business leaders as well as a pulse check with our channel partners and key customers to try to get a read on current and future business condition. Although none of us has a crystal ball, we use this feedback along with macro indicators and our recent performance to develop our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
So what is all of this telling us?  On the macroeconomic side, whether you look at GDP, industrial production growth or PMI, most of the indicators have weakened from 1 quarter ago. Customer and channel sentiment is generally less positive than 1 quarter ago. Most of the signs point to a flattening of cluster demand, at least in the short term. And although sales growth was solid in Q3, we started to see more projects getting pushed out. While there are project delays in every quarter, they seemed to pick up in the third quarter.
So keeping all of this in mind, along with an increasing headwind of currency, we are reducing our sales outlook for the fiscal year to about $6.2 billion. Correspondingly, we are revising our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance range to $5 to $5.20, with about $0.05 of the reduction coming from currency. Even with the guidance revision, sales and earnings in this range represent another record year for the company.
It is clear that we are in an environment of considerable macroeconomic and political uncertainty. We are closely monitoring market condition and are focused on how the fourth quarter will play out. We have proven we know how to be nimble in times of economic uncertainty and will continue to balance near-term financial performance with growth opportunity.
At the end of the day, automation remains a great market, and our competitive differentiation positions us well to outgrow the underlying market. If historical cyclical patterns have any relevance, we would expect to see at least another 2 years in this cycle. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and domain expertise is core to our value proposition for customers. That is what will enable us to continue to gain market share and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2012. Ted?"

My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000.  That's up 3% compared to the third quarter of",1111,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000.  That's up 3% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 4 points. That's a much more negative impact from currency than earlier this year and more negative than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The decline of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar is causing the largest part of that difference.
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago. General Corporate net was $19 million, that compares to $22.3 million in Q3 last year. This Q3 was somewhat lower than average quarter for General Corporate net expense, primarily just timing. We still expect the full year General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.1%. There were some discrete items that reduced the rate in the quarter. Year-to-date, the effective rate was 23.8%. So through 9 months, we're running very close to our full year expectation of 24%. Last year in Q3, the tax rate was 19.1%, also lower due to the recognition of discrete items.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.33, up $0.09 compared to Q3 last year and despite the higher tax rate.  Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 143.5 million, that's down about 2.4 million shares from the average of Q3 last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million of shares at a cost of about $121 million. Year-to-date, through the end of June, we've repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of about $170 million.
The increased rate of repurchases in Q3 is generally consistent with the intentions that we outlined in the earnings call at the end of April. 
Moving to Slide 6, this is a more graphical representation of total company results for the third quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q3 was 3%, 7% x currency. Reported sales were flat sequentially but up about 1 point, excluding currency translation.
On the right side of the slide, you can see a healthy increase in segment operating earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially. Segment operating margin was 18.2% in the quarter, up 0.8 points compared to last year and up 1 point sequentially. The year-over-year margin expansion reflects volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending and unfavorable mix. We also benefited in Q3 from lower incentive compensation expense, including year-to-date adjustments related to reduced expectations for full year sales and earnings. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in each of the segments.  Through 3 quarters, segment operating margin is 18.2%, up 1.4 points from the same 9 months of last year. 
Let's move to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q3 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales were $664 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by about 4 points, so organic sales growth was approximately 3%. Sales were flat sequentially.
Operating margin for the quarter was 27.5%, up 1.4 points compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date operating margin in Architecture & Software is 27.1 points -- or 27.1%, up almost 2 points from the same period last year.
Let's turn to Slide 8 results for the Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales were $897 million in the quarter, up 6% compared to Q3 last year. The increase included about 1 point contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 5-point reduction due to currency. So an organic sales increase of 10%. 
Solutions and services businesses grew about 16% organically year-over-year, contributing the lion's share of the dollar growth. Sales in this segment were flat sequentially. Segment operating earnings were $102 million, an increase of 16% compared to Q3 last year, with segment operating margin at 11.3%, up almost a full point from a year ago.
Year-to-date, Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.3 points compared to last year.
The next slide provides a look at regional sales performance. Keith provided a good deal of color on the regional sales performance, so I won't repeat that. Perhaps just a couple of comments. 
Looking at the difference between the growth rates in the middle column, that's the as-reported year-over-year comparison, and in far right column, which is x currency, you'll note the significant negative impact from currency, particularly in EMEA and Latin America, and the largest impact in Latin America coming from Brazil. 
In EMEA, with ex-currency growth at 5%, we benefited from about a 2-point contribution from acquisitions year-over-year. And to reinforce a point that Keith made, maybe the most positive message from this slide is the organic growth in all regions.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $232 million, that's about 122% of net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in quarter 1. We would expect conversion to be about 100% excluding that pension contribution.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for the full year. As Keith mentioned, we've reduced the narrowed sales and earnings guidance. We now expect sales for the full year of about $6.2 billion. Think of that as a range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion, and that compares to the previous guidance of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. We now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3 points for the full year. Previous guidance assumed a 2-point decrease due to currency. Across the sales guidance range, there's about a $50 million negative impact from currency compared to the prior guidance.
Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of about 6% to 7%.  Previous guidance was 6% to 9%. We still expect segment margin to be a little over 18%. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date. And we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20. As Keith mentioned, currency effects are reducing EPS across the guidance range by about $0.05 compared to the prior guidance.
We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

Even though reported sales were down slightly, there was positive organic growth, and that had some attractive conversion. We also had somewhat better mix sequentially. We've talked about the unfavorable mix in Q2. And the incentive comp that I mentioned also favorably impacted margins sequentially a bit. So I mean, that kind of explains the A&S margin performance in the quarter. As it relates to incrementals in Q4, especially when you get small sales changes and negative changes, the incrementals start to get a little funky. But basically, I would say if you think about the sequential performance from Q3 to Q4 that we're going to get a little bit -- at mid-point, a little bit of organic volume growth. And that's going to be offset largely by unfavorable mix."

In the U.S., we are seeing some project, I'll say, really front-log pushouts, particularly in paper and metals. The ongoing small project business is good in the U.S. So little different there in the fact that it's really the front-log pushout that we're seeing. Probably where the most significant changes are occurring -- and all of this is based upon our expectations where, in particular, in Asia, we were expecting to see some acceleration of projects in the second half of the year, and that's not occurring. And so we're seeing both backlog and front-log pushouts in projects in Asia. We associate a lot of that with just the market conditions, the macroeconomic conditions, mainly in China and India and the liquidity issues in both of those countries as well. And it just, in particular, in China -- we weren't expecting anything in India. But in China, we thought we would see that acceleration, and in fact, we have not. So from our expectation, it's been lower, even though we had growth in China. In Latin America, probably the biggest impact is what we're seeing in Brazil, and that's not so much -- in Latin America, it's not so much in the large projects such as the oil and gas and the mining projects, which tend to be very long-term investments, and those don't really move much at the end of the day. It's more in the shorter-term projects, particularly, in Brazil, where they're struggling with both the high interest rates and also the real currency that is making some of their exporting manufacturing less competitive. So that tends to be a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the project delays as we go forward here."

I mean, it's 3%. But the fact that we're still growing in a very, very tough environment is very encouraging for us, and we're very pleased with the team's work there to make this happen. We are seeing the slowdown in Western Europe. Some of the countries are seeing a much more difficult environment. As you would expect, Southern Europe is -- it's tougher than it was in the earlier part of the year. But we are seeing the growth in emerging Europe, and we see projects continuing to be moving forward. There's not really a slowdown with respect to -- particularly, oil and gas has been very strong. And also, some of the metals markets in the Middle East continue to be strong. And once again, these are generally large projects that don't get moved simply because of a short-term issue. They tend to be longer-term, decade-type investments, and they tend to continue to move forward. And we haven't seen any delay in that. In Europe, the delay is -- more of it has been in what I would call some of the consumer industries. Auto, as all of you know, is struggling more in Europe with the overcapacity. You've seen recent print -- recent articles about the taking offline of some of their capacity. And so we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown there. But Europe, in automotive, is probably not as strong for us as any other region in the world. So it's probably less of an impact to us. But along that line, tire goes pretty close with automotive, and we're seeing slowdowns there, which does impact some of the OEM activity in Europe. And then food and beverage, the consumer products areas are also starting to see more slowdown and pushout of projects. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the European front."

But certainly for us, this feels more like a pause and a slowing of growth as opposed to a fundamental downturn at this point in time. And so, obviously, the most recent memory that we have is-- back in '08. And I think there's some meaningful differences than what we saw at that point in time. For example, back in '08, we had, at least in the U.S., we had 2 major car companies on the verge of bankruptcy. We had a very strong bubble in the housing sector, and we were getting close to but not yet in the financial crisis that occurred later in the fall. And at this point -- and today, we don't see any of those. And more importantly, most companies' balance sheets are very strong. So they have an ability to, I think, easier ride through a slowdown and yet continue to spend in the appropriate areas that make sense. So we really aren't, at this point, seeing similarities to '08 other than what we talked about a little earlier, which is there are some project delays. And while a lot of that is normal, we did see a little push-up of that, a push-up of that in our third quarter. But certainly, given the macro and political environment, at this point, we just feel that that's just a normal course of action that we would expect companies to be taking. So we're obviously very focused on Q4 and to get a better read of what's occurring, and that's one of the reasons we want to be careful with our spending at this point in time. But we're still expecting growth, and we are expecting that the cycle will continue, although we don't know the shape of it at this point in time."

So other than those nuance -- not nuances, those areas, in general, just the slowing and just the rate of increase was different than we anticipated at the start of the quarter."

And that's -- and it's not so much because of the currency. Those types of -- that doesn't cause a reaction as quick in the marketplace as just the change of the rates in 1 quarter. There is a selling cycle. There is a build cycle that has to come into play and an order cycle that comes into that as well. So we wouldn't see that quick of a reaction. We believe that the performance in Europe is really because of what we've done in the last couple of years, to build and to focus on OEMs. And in particular, the success we see is driven less by the currency and more by the strength of exporting OEMs. And certainly, if you look at the performance of the machinery builders in Europe, the domestic market is very weak, and what has been supporting it in the last couple of quarters -- supporting the industry in the last couple of quarters has been exporting. And exporting to the U.S. and exporting to Latin America with a somewhat of a decline in the exports. Asia, particularly China, and the domestic market has weakened. So it's played to our strength, and more importantly, played to the areas that we focused on in the last couple of years. And we believe that's been one of the areas that we've been able to create share gain and one of the reasons why we've been able to continue to grow in a very, very difficult economy there."

We definitely understand the need to respond to the short-term environment that we're operating in. On the other hand, we also understand that, as a technology company, we need to continue to make investments, particularly in our core platforms and in our customer-facing resources. And while we may not add there, we certainly want to maintain at a very meaningful level the investments that we're making, particularly in emerging markets, where we have to continue to build our capabilities and, certainly, in the core technologies that our customers are counting on. But more importantly, that's what gives us the competitive differentiation. And quite frankly, it's one of the reasons we came out of the last downturn as strong as we did. So we want to make sure we continue to maintain the proper investment levels and deal with the current economic situation appropriately, but not at the expense of prolonging the recovery and the benefits of new products and new customers in the upturn. And quite frankly, we never experienced the speed and depth of the decline that we saw in 2009. So the decrementals that you talked about were probably much higher than I guess I would call normal, although, as I said earlier to one of the questions, I don't know if there is a normal anymore.

As far as the outlook, we would expect transportation, in particular, auto, to continue to be a healthy grower. And we like the front log that we see in transportation and, particularly, automotive. And we see it across many regions with the exception of EMEA. The heavy industries there, we would expect to see some performance flattening. We think oil and gas will maintain the strength that it has. But as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some forward sentiment in metals and mining that appears to be more cautious now than it was previously, although we don't see that as a big impact in Q4. And then the consumer is basically flat. We think the spending there is really focused in emerging markets and then process optimization in some of the mature markets.

So we expect the liquidity situation to get better as well as the stimulus. And so I think as far where were the areas that we saw the softness, well, I think for the quarter, it was really in a couple of activities. And the most important was probably the stimulus did not ramp up or did not get executed as fast as we thought, particularly in some of the municipal projects, which tend to be the area they go to quickly to drive investment and improve spending. And the other area was simply the liquidity issue. Many small-, mid-sized customers, distributors, system integrators, it was tough for them to get money. And I think that is what caused some of the project delays that we referred to that impacted us in China. So it was the small- and mid-sized companies and then projects and a little bit associated with a slow implementation of the stimulus that got announced earlier in the year."

So we think safety, we think compliance, we think cost reduction and productivity plays very well in a slowing economy. And certainly, we think emerging markets is where we will, again, see ongoing spending for capacity expansion and new investments and, I should say, new capacity, simply because of the ongoing expansion of the economy as well as the growing middle-class and disposable income. And certainly, if you look at historical, the '06 to '08 period, we still grew at an average of 7.5%. So we -- I think we believe we can outgrow the market. And if it's a slower-growth environment, we still expect to be able to grow at a faster pace. And, quite candidly, that's, I think, one of the beauties of the automation market.

So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. My remarks will cover highlights for the quarter, our assessment of business conditions and an updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck.
We delivered solid 7% organic growth in the third quarter with organic growth in all regions. Operating margin expanded almost 1 point, and the earnings per share grew 9% or 13%, if you exclude the headwind from a higher tax rate. So overall, a good quarter in the midst of a more challenging macroeconomic environment.
Let me give you some color on sales in the quarter.
Generally, all regions came in at the lower end of our growth rate expectation, reflecting a slowing of market demand. The U.S. was stable, with 6% organic growth, and Canada had another robust quarter of 24% growth.
EMEA held up reasonably well with 3% organic growth in spite of deteriorating macroeconomic condition. While parts of Western Europe declined in the quarter, emerging EMEA had very strong double-digit growth. 
In Asia, we actually saw stronger growth in mature countries than in emerging. While China did grow sequentially, 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter was below our expectation. The government's stimulus actions have yet to jump start economic growth. We continue to believe that China will rebound to higher growth rate, but it now appears more likely to happen after our Q4.
India remained weak and sales were down in the quarter. We have yet to see evidence of improvement in their economy. 
Lastly, Latin America organic sales growth of 5% in the quarter fell considerably short of our expectation. Most of the sales shortfall was in Brazil, which is experiencing an economic slowdown and has led to delays in customer spending. Mexico, on the other hand, was a bright spot, with over 30% growth. 
I have a few other third quarter highlights. Our Process business delivered another good quarter of sales growth at 15%. On a year-to-date basis, sales are up 20% in Process. In June, the board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we increased the dividend by 11%. Both of these actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.
Ted will provide more detail on third quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'll move on to our revised outlook.
Every quarter, we do an extensive review with our sales and business leaders as well as a pulse check with our channel partners and key customers to try to get a read on current and future business condition. Although none of us has a crystal ball, we use this feedback along with macro indicators and our recent performance to develop our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
So what is all of this telling us?  On the macroeconomic side, whether you look at GDP, industrial production growth or PMI, most of the indicators have weakened from 1 quarter ago. Customer and channel sentiment is generally less positive than 1 quarter ago. Most of the signs point to a flattening of cluster demand, at least in the short term. And although sales growth was solid in Q3, we started to see more projects getting pushed out. While there are project delays in every quarter, they seemed to pick up in the third quarter.
So keeping all of this in mind, along with an increasing headwind of currency, we are reducing our sales outlook for the fiscal year to about $6.2 billion. Correspondingly, we are revising our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance range to $5 to $5.20, with about $0.05 of the reduction coming from currency. Even with the guidance revision, sales and earnings in this range represent another record year for the company.
It is clear that we are in an environment of considerable macroeconomic and political uncertainty. We are closely monitoring market condition and are focused on how the fourth quarter will play out. We have proven we know how to be nimble in times of economic uncertainty and will continue to balance near-term financial performance with growth opportunity.
At the end of the day, automation remains a great market, and our competitive differentiation positions us well to outgrow the underlying market. If historical cyclical patterns have any relevance, we would expect to see at least another 2 years in this cycle. 
Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and domain expertise is core to our value proposition for customers. That is what will enable us to continue to gain market share and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. 
Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2012. Ted?"
300504,213996641,331635,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000.  That's up 3% compared to the third quarter of",1111,"Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.
Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000.  That's up 3% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 4 points. That's a much more negative impact from currency than earlier this year and more negative than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The decline of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar is causing the largest part of that difference.
Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago. General Corporate net was $19 million, that compares to $22.3 million in Q3 last year. This Q3 was somewhat lower than average quarter for General Corporate net expense, primarily just timing. We still expect the full year General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.1%. There were some discrete items that reduced the rate in the quarter. Year-to-date, the effective rate was 23.8%. So through 9 months, we're running very close to our full year expectation of 24%. Last year in Q3, the tax rate was 19.1%, also lower due to the recognition of discrete items.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.33, up $0.09 compared to Q3 last year and despite the higher tax rate.  Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 143.5 million, that's down about 2.4 million shares from the average of Q3 last year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million of shares at a cost of about $121 million. Year-to-date, through the end of June, we've repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of about $170 million.
The increased rate of repurchases in Q3 is generally consistent with the intentions that we outlined in the earnings call at the end of April. 
Moving to Slide 6, this is a more graphical representation of total company results for the third quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q3 was 3%, 7% x currency. Reported sales were flat sequentially but up about 1 point, excluding currency translation.
On the right side of the slide, you can see a healthy increase in segment operating earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially. Segment operating margin was 18.2% in the quarter, up 0.8 points compared to last year and up 1 point sequentially. The year-over-year margin expansion reflects volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending and unfavorable mix. We also benefited in Q3 from lower incentive compensation expense, including year-to-date adjustments related to reduced expectations for full year sales and earnings. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in each of the segments.  Through 3 quarters, segment operating margin is 18.2%, up 1.4 points from the same 9 months of last year. 
Let's move to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q3 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales were $664 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by about 4 points, so organic sales growth was approximately 3%. Sales were flat sequentially.
Operating margin for the quarter was 27.5%, up 1.4 points compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date operating margin in Architecture & Software is 27.1 points -- or 27.1%, up almost 2 points from the same period last year.
Let's turn to Slide 8 results for the Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales were $897 million in the quarter, up 6% compared to Q3 last year. The increase included about 1 point contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 5-point reduction due to currency. So an organic sales increase of 10%. 
Solutions and services businesses grew about 16% organically year-over-year, contributing the lion's share of the dollar growth. Sales in this segment were flat sequentially. Segment operating earnings were $102 million, an increase of 16% compared to Q3 last year, with segment operating margin at 11.3%, up almost a full point from a year ago.
Year-to-date, Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.3 points compared to last year.
The next slide provides a look at regional sales performance. Keith provided a good deal of color on the regional sales performance, so I won't repeat that. Perhaps just a couple of comments. 
Looking at the difference between the growth rates in the middle column, that's the as-reported year-over-year comparison, and in far right column, which is x currency, you'll note the significant negative impact from currency, particularly in EMEA and Latin America, and the largest impact in Latin America coming from Brazil. 
In EMEA, with ex-currency growth at 5%, we benefited from about a 2-point contribution from acquisitions year-over-year. And to reinforce a point that Keith made, maybe the most positive message from this slide is the organic growth in all regions.
I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $232 million, that's about 122% of net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in quarter 1. We would expect conversion to be about 100% excluding that pension contribution.
And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for the full year. As Keith mentioned, we've reduced the narrowed sales and earnings guidance. We now expect sales for the full year of about $6.2 billion. Think of that as a range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion, and that compares to the previous guidance of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. We now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3 points for the full year. Previous guidance assumed a 2-point decrease due to currency. Across the sales guidance range, there's about a $50 million negative impact from currency compared to the prior guidance.
Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of about 6% to 7%.  Previous guidance was 6% to 9%. We still expect segment margin to be a little over 18%. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date. And we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20. As Keith mentioned, currency effects are reducing EPS across the guidance range by about $0.05 compared to the prior guidance.
We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A."

Even though reported sales were down slightly, there was positive organic growth, and that had some attractive conversion. We also had somewhat better mix sequentially. We've talked about the unfavorable mix in Q2. And the incentive comp that I mentioned also favorably impacted margins sequentially a bit. So I mean, that kind of explains the A&S margin performance in the quarter. As it relates to incrementals in Q4, especially when you get small sales changes and negative changes, the incrementals start to get a little funky. But basically, I would say if you think about the sequential performance from Q3 to Q4 that we're going to get a little bit -- at mid-point, a little bit of organic volume growth. And that's going to be offset largely by unfavorable mix."

In the U.S., we are seeing some project, I'll say, really front-log pushouts, particularly in paper and metals. The ongoing small project business is good in the U.S. So little different there in the fact that it's really the front-log pushout that we're seeing. Probably where the most significant changes are occurring, and all of this is based upon our expectations where, in particular, in Asia, we were expecting to see some acceleration of projects in the second half of the year, and that's not occurring. And so we're seeing both backlog and front-log pushouts in projects in Asia. We associate a lot of that with just the market conditions, the macroeconomic conditions, mainly in China and India, and the liquidity issues in both of those countries as well. And it just, in particular, in China -- we weren't expecting anything in India. But in China, we thought we would see that acceleration, and in fact, we have not. So from our expectation, it's been lower, even though we had growth in China. In Latin America, probably the biggest impact is what we're seeing in Brazil, and that's not so much -- in Latin America, it's not so much in the large projects such as the oil and gas and the mining projects, which tend to be very long-term investments, and those don't really move much at the end of the day. It's more in the shorter-term projects, particularly, in Brazil, where they're struggling with both the high interest rates and also the real currency that is making some of their exporting manufacturing less competitive. So that tends to be a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the project delays as we go forward here."

I mean, it's 3%. But the fact that we're still growing in a very, very tough environment is very encouraging for us, and we're very pleased with the team's work there to make this happen. We are seeing the slowdown in Western Europe. Some of the countries are seeing a much more difficult environment. As you would expect, Southern Europe is -- it's tougher than it was in the earlier part of the year. But we are seeing the growth in emerging Europe, and we see projects continuing to be moving forward. There's not really a slowdown with respect to -- particularly, oil and gas has been very strong. And also, some of the metals markets in the Middle East continue to be strong. And once again, these are generally large projects that don't get moved simply because of a short-term issue. They tend to be longer-term, decade-type investments, and they tend to continue to move forward. And we haven't seen any delay in that. In Europe, the delay is -- more of it has been in what I would call some of the consumer industries. Auto, as all of you know, is struggling more in Europe with the overcapacity. You've seen recent print -- recent articles about the taking offline of some of their capacity. And so we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown there. But Europe, in automotive, is probably not as strong for us as any other region in the world. So it's probably less of an impact to us. But along that line, tire goes pretty close with automotive, and we're seeing slowdowns there, which does impact some of the OEM activity in Europe. And then food and beverage, the consumer products areas are also starting to see more slowdown and pushout of projects. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the European front."

But certainly for us, this feels more like a pause and a slowing of growth as opposed to a fundamental downturn at this point in time. And so, obviously, the most recent memory that we have is-- back in '08. And I think there's some meaningful differences than what we saw at that point in time. For example, back in '08, we had, at least in the U.S., we had 2 major car companies on the verge of bankruptcy. We had a very strong bubble in the housing sector, and we were getting close to but not yet in the financial crisis that occurred later in the fall. And at this point -- and today, we don't see any of those. And more importantly, most companies' balance sheets are very strong. So they have an ability to, I think, easier ride through a slowdown and yet continue to spend in the appropriate areas that make sense. So we really aren't, at this point, seeing similarities to '08 other than what we talked about a little earlier, which is there are some project delays. And while a lot of that is normal, we did see a little push-up of that, a push-up of that in our third quarter. But certainly, given the macro and political environment, at this point, we just feel that that's just a normal course of action that we would expect companies to be taking. So we're obviously very focused on Q4 and to get a better read of what's occurring, and that's one of the reasons we want to be careful with our spending at this point in time. But we're still expecting growth, and we are expecting that the cycle will continue, although we don't know the shape of it at this point in time."

And certainly, what we're seeing in July is consistent with what we've outlined in the guidance. So really, no fundamental change other than the slowing of growth, particularly in some of the key emerging markets that we did anticipate. We talked about China accelerating. We're not seeing anything unique in India that we didn't expect. But China, not as fast a growth in recovery. And Brazil in a  worse situation than we would have -- than we certainly had anticipated in the previous quarters. So other than those nuance -- not nuances, those areas, in general, just the slowing and just the rate of increase was different than we anticipated at the start of the quarter."

There is a selling cycle. There is a build cycle that has to come into play and an order cycle that comes into that as well. So we wouldn't see that quick of a reaction. We believe that the performance in Europe is really because of what we've done in the last couple of years, to build and to focus on OEMs. And in particular, the success we see is driven less by the currency and more by the strength of exporting OEMs. And certainly, if you look at the performance of the machinery builders in Europe, the domestic market is very weak, and what has been supporting it in the last couple of quarters -- supporting the industry in the last couple of quarters has been exporting. And exporting to the U.S. and exporting to Latin America with a somewhat of a decline in the exports. Asia, particularly China, and the domestic market has weakened. So it's played to our strength, and more importantly, played to the areas that we focused on in the last couple of years.

But more importantly, that's what gives us the competitive differentiation. And quite frankly, it's one of the reasons we came out of the last downturn as strong as we did. So we want to make sure we continue to maintain the proper investment levels and deal with the current economic situation appropriately, but not at the expense of prolonging the recovery and the benefits of new products and new customers in the upturn. And quite frankly, we never experienced the speed and depth of the decline that we saw in 2009.

If you look at the ones that would be about at our average, the verticals would be tire, life sciences. And if you look at the one that probably grew below the Rockwell average, it would have been the consumer industries on a global basis. As far as the outlook, we would expect transportation, in particular, auto, to continue to be a healthy grower. And we like the front log that we see in transportation and, particularly, automotive. And we see it across many regions with the exception of EMEA. The heavy industries there, we would expect to see some performance flattening. We think oil and gas will maintain the strength that it has. But as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some forward sentiment in metals and mining that appears to be more cautious now than it was previously, although we don't see that as a big impact in Q4. And then the consumer is basically flat. We think the spending there is really focused in emerging markets and then process optimization in some of the mature markets. So that's a little bit of a feel for the forward-looking picture on our verticals."

So we expect the liquidity situation to get better as well as the stimulus. And so I think as far where were the areas that we saw the softness, well, I think for the quarter, it was really in a couple of activities. And the most important was probably the stimulus did not ramp up or did not get executed as fast as we thought, particularly in some of the municipal projects, which tend to be the area they go to quickly to drive investment and improve spending. And the other area was simply the liquidity issue. Many small-, mid-sized customers, distributors, system integrators, it was tough for them to get money. And I think that is what caused some of the project delays that we referred to that impacted us in China. So it was the small- and mid-sized companies and then projects and a little bit associated with a slow implementation of the stimulus that got announced earlier in the year."

So we think safety, we think compliance, we think cost reduction and productivity plays very well in a slowing economy. And certainly, we think emerging markets is where we will, again, see ongoing spending for capacity expansion and new investments and, I should say, new capacity, simply because of the ongoing expansion of the economy, as well as the growing middle-class and disposable income. And certainly, if you look at historical, the '06 to '08 period, we still grew at an average of 7.5%. So we -- I think we believe we can outgrow the market. And if it's a slower-growth environment, we still expect to be able to grow at a faster pace. And, quite candidly, that's, I think, one of the beauties of the automation market. It's an area and an industry that companies need what we do not just in good times, but in bad times as well.

Let me start by saying to anyone affected by last week's hurricane and its aftermath that I appreciate your efforts to join our call today. I hope you were able to stay out of harms way. I'll start with highlights for the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 4 of the Slide deck. I was pleased with 5% organic growth especially given the tough comparison to last year's very strong fourth quarter. Growth rates continue to moderate during the difficult economic environment but once again, we had organic growth in all regions. Emerging markets grew 11% in the quarter with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. Most of the growth this quarter came from our solutions businesses as our products businesses were essentially flat compared to last year. Process had another great quarter with 18% growth. In the quarter, we initiated restructuring actions with corresponding charges of about $13 million. We're calling this out because the charges are considerably higher than a normal run rate for pay-as-you-go actions. These restructuring actions provide us with some headroom to rebalance investments in 2013. Earnings per share were $1.38 about, $0.01 lower than last year. Restructuring charges reduced EPS by about $0.07. Cash flow in the quarter was strong and we repurchased another 1.4 million shares. So overall, a good end to a very solid year. I'll make a few comments on the full year before I move to our outlook. We entered 2012 in the midst of global economic uncertainty and that is still the prevailing environment. The prospects of a fiscal cliff in the U.S., the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the slowdown in key emerging markets all weighed on economic growth this year.  Despite that, we delivered organic growth of 6% for the full year and ended the year with record sales of up over $6.2 billion. Canada had very strong growth of 20%, impacted continued strength in the resource based industry, Mexico also grew 20% and industrial activity there remains strong but our European region was the real standout with 6% organic growth in the face of a recession. I was encouraged that we grew in both developed and emerging EMEA and I want to our knowledge that EMEA leadership team who executed very well within difficult market conditions. It's not on the chart but Process sales grew 20% for the full year and we continue to win both batch and continuous process applications. I was pleased that we were able to expand segment operating margin a full point while continuing to invest for growth. Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year and repurchased 3.7 million shares. We're proud of our track record of returning cash to shareholders. We delivered solid results in a challenging environment this year. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers, suppliers and partners for their continued support throughout the year. 
So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2013. Growth rates moderated considerably as we moved through fiscal '12 and our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat. We saw an increase in project delays in Q4 and ended the year with a lower solutions backlog than a year ago. So there's not a lot of positive momentum as we enter the new year.  Each region has its own story but the global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam at the moment. We continue to believe this is a pause in the recovery and not an inflection point, which is consistent with what we are hearing from our sales organization, our channel partners and customers. The forecast that we monitor for GDP and industrial production call for growth next year but consistent with those forecasts and given current conditions in our lower backlog, we don't expect to see much growth until the second half of 2013. It's possible that the current global economic sluggishness is creating some pent-up demand for manufacturing investment if that is true, a couple of positive macroeconomic signals could give customers confidence to accelerate their spending. We're counting on market conditions improving early enough to have a positive impact on the second half of our fiscal 2013. We're excited about and counting on, new products to help us grow next year even in a sluggish market conditions. From a regional perspective, we expect the U.S. to stay on a low growth track and we don't think Europe gets any worse. Asia Pacific and Latin America should have higher growth rates next year driven, primarily by improvements in China and Brazil. With all of that said, we expect total sales growth of 2% to 6% next year. Ted will provide more detail around our sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. Although we can't control the economy, we know how to remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. In the end, with our great technology, talented and dedicated employees, loyal partners, robust installed base and share gain opportunities, we're well-positioned to continue to outperform the market. Before I wrap up, I want to assure you that Automation the events this week will continue as planned. Downtown Philadelphia, the convention center in sustained minimal or no damage. We feel extremely fortunate that Automation Fair, its supporting events and our investor conference will proceed as scheduled but the people in businesses affected by hurricane Sandy, do remain in our thoughts. For those of you who haven't been to an automation fair, we expect to host thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. It is a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers. At the investor conference on Thursday, you'll hear from John McDermott, the leader of our global sales and marketing team and from one of our major global customers. Then we will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor. After lunch, we will hold the webcast where we will learn more about our strategy and progress from me and Ted, Frank the head of our Architecture & Software segment and Blake Brett, the head of our Control Products & Solutions segment will provide a deeper dive into two of our best growth opportunities, Process and OEMs. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us and we look forward to seeing you there.  
So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2013.  Ted?"
300504,223285525,377999,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2012",2012-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith and good morning, everybody. A lot to cover this morning and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000, that's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was",2055,"Thanks, Keith and good morning, everybody. A lot to cover this morning and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000, that's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was 5% and the year-over-year impact of currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points. Segment operating earnings were $295 million, down 1% compared to last year as Keith mentioned, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $13 million in the quarter. General corporate net expense was $20.6 million compared to $22.2 million a year ago. The affect of tax rate in the quarter was 23.4%, that's 2.2 points higher than fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.38, down $0.01 compared to Q4 last year. The restructuring charges reduced earnings per share by about $0.07 cents. The average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 141.5 million.  In Q4, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $96 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares at a cost of $265 million. On the earnings call in July, we projected to repurchase about 3 million shares for the full year, so we were more aggressive than that in the quarter.  
Turning to Page 6, fourth quarter results were up automation total. On the left side of this slide you can see that sales increased only slightly from last year, that's the currency affect offsetting the 5% organic growth. You might remember that Q4 fiscal '11 was particularly strong quarter especially in our solutions and services businesses and sales in the fourth quarter this year were up 7% sequentially. Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart, segment operating margin in Q4 was 17.7% down a bit from 18% in Q4 last year. Lots of puts and takes on margin in the quarter but the $13 million in restructuring charges reduced operating margin by about 80 basis points, some margin would've been about 18.5% without those charges and I think that would've pretty much as expected. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 30.3%, about same as last quarter.  
Moving on to Page 7, this slide the displays the Q4 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $671 million in the quarter down about 2% year-over-year. Organic growth of 3% was more than offset by a currency translation impact that reduced sales by 5 points. Sequentially, Architecture & Software sales increased 1%. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.8%, down 1.2 points from Q4 last year.  About 1/2 of the restructuring charges were incurred in this segment excluding those charges, margins were down about 20 basis points compared to last year. 
The next slide Page 8 covers our Control Products & Solutions segment.  Control Products & Solutions sales in Q4 were $993 million, that's up 2% from a year ago. Currency translation reduced sales by 4 points so organic growth was 6%. Sales in the product portion of CP&S in Q4 were down a little year-over-year but sales for the solutions and services businesses were up 12%, pretty strong performance and as I mentioned earlier, against the difficult year ago comparison for the solutions and services businesses. However, orders for solutions and services were weak in the quarter. The book-to-bill was only 0.8. It's typical for the solutions and services book-to-bill to be below one in our fourth quarter, but 0.8 was lower than normal. As Keith mentioned, we saw an increasing number of budgets being delayed in Q4, particularly larger group projects and that was pretty much the case in all regions. Our backlog in the solutions and services businesses is down approximately 7% compared to this time last year.  
Moving to the right side on the slide, segment operating earnings increased 7% year-over-year and operating margin expanded by 0.6 to 13%.  Control Products & Solutions also incurred about 1/2 of the restructuring charges, which reduced margins in the quarter by about 0.6, that offset some of the benefit of higher volume.  
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, that's displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects. As we discussed on the last earnings call, growth rates have clearly moderated from earlier in the year despite that, as Keith Rick mentioned we realized organic growth in every region in Q4. Canada has been consistently strong this year with 18% organic growth this quarter, EMEA organic growth was 7% better than we expected coming into the quarter. We're continuing to benefit from our success with OEM customers and we saw particularly strong growth in the emerging countries in this region. Asia Pacific was up only 2% compared to fourth quarter last year. There was a very mixed performance across the countries in the region. China was up 11% year-over-year, India was about flat to Q4 last year and Australia was down significantly. Latin America was up 8% compared to Q4 last year and that was with Brazil down about 4%. There was continued strong growth in the balance of the Latin American region and particularly in Mexico.  
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $347 million. The conversion on net income was 178%. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $598 million, that represents conversion on net income of 81% and if you exclude the discretionary pension contribution we made in the first quarter, conversion for the full year would've been 105%.  
So that's the fourth quarter. I'll turn now to Page 11 for a summary of the full-year results for fiscal '12. Sales reached $6,259,000,000 for the full year up 4%. Organic growth was 6%, currency translation reduced sales by about 3 points and acquisitions added a little less than one point.  Segment operating margin for the full year was 18.1% up one full point from last year. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $5.13, up 7% compared to last year. And I think Keith already mentioned that this represents another year of record sales and EPS for the company. Since we've already covered cash flow, I'll move to Slide 12, which describes the new approach we're taking to the way we deal with pension expense and some of our earnings measures. Significant declines in interest rates over the past several years have caused an extraordinary increasing our pension expense. We consider a large portion of that pension expense increase to be unrelated to our underlying operating performance. Because of this, beginning in fiscal '13, we decided to introduce new non-GAAP measures that exclude non-operating pension cost from our income from continuing operations and corresponding EPS and we're also changing our definition of segment operating earnings to exclude the non-operating pension class. As shown on the right side of the slide, we're defining non-operating pension costs to include defined benefit planned interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and the impacts of any planned curtailments and settlements. We consider service costs related to active employees to be operating pension costs. We believe that the non-operating components of pension costs are more related to financial market factors and that excluding them, presents an earnings picture more reflective of our underlying operating performance and also allow us for more relevant historical comparisons.  
Let's turn to Slide 13. This is next slide provide a sense of the extent to which the non-operating pension costs have impacted our results overtime and why we think it's important to provide better visibility of that impact. The three columns to the left display the operating and non-operating components of pension expense for fiscal 2008 and 2012 along with our projection of pension expense for fiscal 2013. The far right column, which is labeled 2013 better and worse than 2008 shows the difference in the components of pension expense between those 2 years. In the 5-year period, total GAAP pension expense increased by $140 million. You can see that total at the bottom of the column. That total GAAP pension expense increase represents more than  2's point negative impact on operating margins in 2013 compared to 2008. The non-operating component of that pension expense increase is $104 million or almost 75% of the increase. We think it's important for investors to understand the impact of the non-operating pension expense. The second column from the right right side of the slide shows the difference between the components of pension expense for 2012 compared to 2013. For 2013, we're projecting a $64 million increase in the total GAAP pension expense. The non-operating portion of that increase is $44 million or about 70% of the increase. It's important to note that even with this change, there's still a $20 million increase in the operating pension cost in 2013. The operating pension cost will continue to be included in our segment operating earnings. The next slide, Slide 14, provides a walk from our fiscal 2012 GAAP results to the new non-GAAP measures so that we can provide investors with a consistent comparison against our fiscal '13 guidance. Focusing on the middle column, which displays the adjustments, I'll start with segment operating earnings, which would've been $32.5 million higher in fiscal '12 under the new definition of segment operating earnings. General corporate net expense would've been $2.7 million lower, so total income before taxes would've been $35.2 million higher. After-tax, that yields an earnings per share add back of $0.16. So adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '12 would've been $5.29 compared to $5.13 as reported. Segment operating margin increases by 0.5 points under the new definition of segment operating earnings to 18.6% and the effective tax rate also increases by about 40 basis points. As Rondi mentioned at the beginning of the call, reconciliations of earnings per share and segment operating earnings annually and by quarter back to 2008 are available in the supplemental data book that's posted to our external website. 
So now let me turn to Slide 15 and we can discuss guidance for fiscal year '13. Regarding the top line Keith provided a good deal of color on our views of the economic market environment we're expecting in 2013. I'll repeat just a couple of key points. Growth rates moderated throughout fiscal '12.  Our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat and there's not much positive momentum as we enter the new year. The global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam but we still think this is a plus, not an inflection point. We expect to see improved market conditions in 2013 but we don't expect to see any significant improvement until the latter part of the year. Given that context, we expect fiscal 2013 sales to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.65 billion, that's 1% to 5% organic growth. We expect currency and acquisitions to each add about 0.5. of growth, so that's a makeup of the 2% to 6% growth that Keith highlighted. We expect segment operating margin to be about 18.7%, that compares to the restated fiscal '12 segment operating margin of 18.6%. Think of the 18.7% as the midpoint of guidance, so maybe a little bit higher or lower across the sales range. Not a significant margin improvement year-over-year but at the midpoint, we're at a relatively modest 3% organic growth and even with our new definition of segment operating earnings, we're absorbing a $20 million increase in pension expense. As Keith noted, our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.35 to $5.75 and that compares to EPS of $5.29 for fiscal '12 on an adjusted basis. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted net income of about 100% in fiscal '13 and then maybe a couple of other items that aren't shown here. We expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $83 million, about equal to fiscal '12. We expect an effective tax rate in fiscal '13 of about 26% and we expect the average share count next year to be between 139 million and 140 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi and we can begin the Q&A session"

If you look at heavy industries and you take oil and gas out of there, I would say currently we're seeing the greatest slowdown in buying at this point would be mining, it's probably the toughest area at this point in time. Some of that is driven by labor situation such as you have in South Africa. Some of it is a demand from China and India, impacting Australia and some of it is just the environmental issues associated with some of the large new mines particularly in Latin America. So it's probably created a slowing of investments and that's the area that we see at the most. With respect to consumer, I think we still see -- consumer isn't one that has high peaks and low valleys.

I think what we're looking at is conversations we're having with our sales organization, our channel, our customers, we're looking at the macroeconomic projections that are put out there by people like global insight. I would say generally what we're seeing in those macroeconomic projections and I think this is also true of IMF, is that there's expected growth next year but generally weighted toward the latter half. We're also hopeful that once we get past elections and the fiscal cliff that hopefully that will reduce some of the uncertainty we have in North America right now. So we think that's consistent with a notion of whatever's going to happen in our fiscal 2013, is more likely because it's in the second half."

I'll start with highlights",1137,"Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying to anyone affected by last week's hurricane and its aftermath that I appreciate your efforts to join our call today. I hope you were able to stay out of harm's way. 
I'll start with highlights for the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. I was pleased with 5% organic growth, especially given the tough comparison to last year's very strong fourth quarter. Growth rates continued to moderate during the difficult economic environment, but once again, we had organic growth in all regions. Emerging markets grew 11% in the quarter with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. 
Most of the growth this quarter came from our solutions businesses as our products businesses were essentially flat compared to last year. Process had another great quarter with 18% growth. 
In the quarter, we initiated restructuring actions with corresponding charges of about $13 million. We're calling this out because the charges are considerably higher than a normal run rate for pay-as-you-go actions. These restructuring actions provide us with some headroom to rebalance investments in 2013. 
Earnings per share were $1.38 about, $0.01 lower than last year. Restructuring charges reduced EPS by about $0.07. Cash flow in the quarter was strong, and we repurchased another 1.4 million shares. So overall, a good end to a very solid year. 
I'll make a few comments on the full year before I move to our outlook. We entered 2012 in the midst of global economic uncertainty, and that is still the prevailing environment. The prospects of a fiscal cliff in the U.S., the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the slowdown in key emerging markets all weighed on economic growth this year. Despite that, we delivered organic growth of 6% for the full year and ended the year with record sales of up over $6.2 billion. 
Canada had very strong growth of 20%, reflecting continued strength in the resource-based industry. Mexico also grew 20%, and industrial activity there remained strong. But our European region was the real standout with 6% organic growth in the face of a recession. I was encouraged that we grew in both developed and emerging EMEA, and I want to our acknowledge the EMEA leadership team who executed very well within difficult market conditions. 
It's not on the chart but Process sales grew 20% for the full year, and we continue to win both batch and continuous process applications. I was pleased that we were able to expand segment operating margin a full point while continuing to invest for growth. 
Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year and repurchased 3.7 million shares. We're proud of our track record of returning cash to share owners. 
We delivered solid results in a challenging environment this year. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers, suppliers and partners for their continued support throughout the year. 
So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2013. Growth rates moderated considerably as we moved through fiscal '12, and our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat. We saw an increase in project delays in Q4 and ended the year with a lower solutions backlog than a year ago. So there's not a lot of positive momentum as we enter the new year.  
Each region has its own story, but the global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam at the moment. We continue to believe this is a pause in the recovery and not an inflection point, which is consistent with what we are hearing from our sales organization, our channel partners and customers. The forecast that we monitor for GDP and industrial production call for growth next year. But consistent with those forecasts and given current conditions and our lower backlog, we don't expect to see much growth until the second half of 2013. 
It's possible that the current global economic sluggishness is creating some pent-up demand for manufacturing investment. If that is true, a couple of positive macroeconomic signals could give customers confidence to accelerate their spending. We're counting on market conditions improving early enough to have a positive impact on the second half of our fiscal 2013. We're excited about and counting on new products to help us grow next year even in the sluggish market conditions. 
From a regional perspective, we expect the U.S. to stay on a low growth track, and we don't think Europe gets any worse. Asia Pacific and Latin America should have higher growth rates next year, driven primarily by improvements in China and Brazil. 
With all of that said, we expect total sales growth of 2% to 6% next year. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Although we can't control the economy, we know how to remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. In the end, with our great technology, talented and dedicated employees, loyal partners, robust installed base and share gain opportunities, we're well positioned to continue to outperform the market. 
Before I wrap up, I want to assure you that Automation affair -- Automation Fair events this week will continue as planned. Downtown Philadelphia, the convention center and hotels sustained minimal or no damage. We feel extremely fortunate that Automation Fair, its supporting events and our investor conference will proceed as scheduled. But the people in businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy do remain in our thoughts. For those of you who haven't been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. It is a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers. 
At the investor conference on Thursday, you'll hear from John McDermott, the leader of our global sales and marketing team, and from one of our major global customers. Then we will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor. After lunch, we will hold a webcast where you will learn more about our strategy and progress from me and Ted. Frank Kulaszewicz, the Head of our Architecture & Software segment, and Blake Moret, the Head of our Control Products & Solutions segment, will provide a deeper dive into 2 of our best growth opportunities, process and OEMs. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us, and we look forward to seeing you there.  
So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2013. Ted?"

A lot to cover this morning, and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000. That's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth wa",2066,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everybody. A lot to cover this morning, and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000. That's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was 5%, and the year-over-year impact of currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points. Segment operating earnings were $295 million, down 1% compared to last year. 
As Keith mentioned, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $13 million in the quarter. General corporate net expense was $20.6 million compared to $22.2 million a year ago. The effect of tax rate in the quarter was 23.4%. That's 2.2 points higher than fourth quarter last year. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.38, down $0.01 compared to Q4 last year. The restructuring charges reduced earnings per share by about $0.07 cents. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 141.5 million. In Q4, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $96 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares at a cost of $265 million. On the earnings call in July, we projected to repurchase about 3 million shares for the full year, so we were more aggressive than that in the quarter.  
Turning to Page 6. Fourth quarter results were up on automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see that sales increased only slightly from last year. That's the currency effect offsetting the 5% organic growth. You might remember that Q4 fiscal '11 was a particularly strong quarter, especially in our solutions and services businesses, and sales in the fourth quarter this year were up 7% sequentially. 
Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart. Segment operating margin in Q4 was 17.7%, down a bit from 18% in Q4 last year. Lots of puts and takes on margin in the quarter, but the $13 million in restructuring charges reduced operating margin by about 80 basis points. So margin would have been about 18.5% without those charges, and I think that would've been pretty much as expected. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 30.3% about the same as last quarter.  
Moving on to Page 7. This slide displays the Q4 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $671 million in the quarter, down about 2% year-over-year. Organic growth of 3% was more than offset by a currency translation impact that reduced sales by 5 points. Sequentially, Architecture & Software sales increased 1%. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.8%, down 1.2 points from Q4 last year. About 1/2 of the restructuring charges were incurred in this segment. Excluding those charges, margins were down about 20 basis points compared to last year. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Control Products & Solutions sales in Q4 were $993 million. That's up 2% from a year ago. Currency translation reduced sales by 4 points, so organic growth was 6%. Sales in the product portion of CP&S in Q4 were down a little year-over-year, but sales for the solutions and services businesses were up 12%, a pretty strong performance, and as I mentioned earlier, against the difficult year-ago comparison for the solutions and services businesses. 
However, orders for solutions and services were weak in the quarter. The book to bill was only 0.8. It's typical for the solutions and services book to bill to be below one in our fourth quarter, but 0.8 is lower than normal. As Keith mentioned, we saw an increasing number of projects being delayed in Q4, particularly larger projects, and that was pretty much the case in all regions. Our backlog in the solutions and services businesses is down approximately 7% compared to this time last year.  
Moving to the right side of the slide. Segment operating earnings increased 7% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded by 0.6 to 13%. Control Products & Solutions also incurred about 1/2 of the restructuring charges, which reduced margins in the quarter by about 0.6. That offset some of the benefit of higher volume.  
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column that displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects. As we discussed on the last earnings call, growth rates have clearly moderated from earlier in the year. Despite that, as Keith Rick mentioned, we realized organic growth in every region in Q4. Canada has been consistently strong this year with 18% organic growth this quarter. 
EMEA organic growth was 7% better than we expected coming into the quarter. We're continuing to benefit from our success with OEM customers and saw a particularly strong growth in the emerging countries in this region. 
Asia Pacific was up only 2% compared to fourth quarter last year. There was very mixed performance across the countries in the region. China was up 11% year-over-year. India was about flat to Q4 last year, and Australia was down significantly. 
Latin America was up 8% compared to Q4 last year, and that was with Brazil down about 4%. There was continued strong growth in the balance of the Latin American region and, particularly, in Mexico.  
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $347 million. The conversion on net income was 178%. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $598 million. That represents conversion on net income of 81%. And if you exclude the discretionary pension contribution we made in the first quarter, conversion for the full year would've been 105%. So that's the fourth quarter. 
I'll turn now to Page 11 for a summary of the full year results for fiscal '12. Sales reached $6,259,000,000 for the full year, up 4%. Organic growth was 6%. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3 points, and acquisitions added a little less than one point. Segment operating margin for the full year was 18.1%, up one full point from last year. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $5.13, up 7% compared to last year, and I think Keith already mentioned that this represents another year of record sales and EPS for the company. 
Since we already covered cash flow, I'll move to Slide 12, which describes the new approach we're taking to the way we deal with pension expense and some of our earnings measures. Significant declines in interest rates over the past several years have caused an extraordinary increase in our pension expense. We consider a large portion of that pension expense increase to be unrelated to our underlying operating performance. Because of this, beginning in fiscal '13, we've decided to introduce new non-GAAP measures that exclude nonoperating pension cost from our income from continuing operations and corresponding EPS, and we are also changing our definition of segment operating earnings to exclude the nonoperating pension class. 
As shown on the right side of the slide, we're defining nonoperating pension costs to include the defined benefit planned interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any planned curtailments and settlements. We consider service costs related to active employees to be operating pension costs. We believe that the nonoperating components of pension costs are more related to financial market factors and, that excluding them, presents an earnings picture more reflective of our underlying operating performance and also allow for more relevant historical comparisons.  
Let's turn to Slide 13. This next slide provides a sense of the extent to which the nonoperating pension costs have impacted our results over time and why we think it's important to provide better visibility of that impact. The 3 columns to the left display the operating and nonoperating components of pension expense for fiscal 2008 and 2012, along with our projection of pension expense for fiscal 2013. 
The far right column, which is labeled 2013 better than, worse than 2008, shows the difference in the components of pension expense between those 2 years. In the 5-year period, total GAAP pension expense increased by $140 million. You can see that total at the bottom of the column. That total GAAP pension expense increase represents more than a 2-point negative impact on operating margins in 2013 compared to 2008. The nonoperating component of that pension expense increase is $104 million or almost 75% of the increase. We think it's important for investors to understand the impact of the nonoperating pension expense. 
The second column from the right side of the slide shows the difference between the components of pension expense for 2012 compared to 2013. For 2013, we're projecting a $64 million increase in the total GAAP pension expense. The nonoperating portion of that increase is $44 million or about 70% of the increase. It's important to note that even with this change, there's still a $20 million increase in the operating pension cost in 2013. The operating pension cost will continue to be included in our segment operating earnings. 
The next slide, Slide 14, provides a walk from our fiscal 2012 GAAP results to the new non-GAAP measures so that we can provide investors with a consistent comparison against our fiscal '13 guidance. Focusing on the middle column, which displays the adjustments, I'll start with segment operating earnings, which would have been $32.5 million higher in fiscal '12 under the new definition of segment operating earnings. General corporate net expense would've been $2.7 million lower, so total income before taxes would've been $35.2 million higher. After tax, that yields an earnings per share add back of $0.16. So adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '12 would've been $5.29 compared to $5.13 as reported. 
Segment operating margin increases by 0.5 point under the new definition of segment operating earnings to 18.6%, and the effective tax rate also increases by about 40 basis points. As Rondi mentioned at the beginning of the call, reconciliations of earnings per share and segment operating earnings annually and by quarter back to 2008 are available in the supplemental data book that's posted to our external website. 
So now let me turn to Slide 15, and we can discuss guidance for fiscal year '13. Regarding the top line, Keith provided a good deal of color on our views of the economic and market environment we're expecting in 2013. I'll repeat just a couple of key points: growth rates moderated throughout fiscal '12, our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat and there's not much positive momentum as we enter the new year. The global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam, but we still think this is a plus, not an inflection point. We expect to see improved market conditions in 2013, but we don't expect to see any significant improvement until the latter part of the year. 
Given that context, we expect fiscal 2013 sales to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.65 billion. That's 1% to 5% organic growth. We expect currency and acquisitions to each add about 0.5 point of growth. So that's the makeup of the 2% to 6% growth that Keith highlighted. 
We expect segment operating margin to be about 18.7%. That compares to the restated fiscal '12 segment operating margin of 18.6%. Think of the 18.7% as the midpoint of guidance, so maybe a little bit higher or lower across the sales range. Not a significant margin improvement year-over-year, but at the midpoint, we're at a relatively modest 3% organic growth. And even with our new definition of segment operating earnings, we're absorbing a $20 million increase in pension expense. 
As Keith noted, our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.35 to $5.75, and that compares to EPS of $5.29 for fiscal '12 on an adjusted basis. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted net income of about 100% in fiscal '13. And then maybe a couple of other items that aren't shown here: we expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $83 million, about equal to fiscal '12; we expect an effective tax rate in fiscal '13 of about 26%; and we expect the average share count next year to be between 139 million and 140 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin the Q&A session"

If you look at heavy industries and you take oil and gas out of there, I would say, currently, where we're seeing the greatest slowdown in buying at this point would be mining. It's probably the toughest area at this point in time. Some of that is driven by labor situation, such as you have in South Africa. Some of it is a demand from China and India impacting Australia, and some of it is just the environmental issues associated with some of the large new mines, particularly in Latin America. So it's probably created a slowing of investments, and I think that's the area that we see it the most. With respect to consumer, I think we still see -- consumer isn't one that has high peaks and low valleys, so I think it's stay pretty well flat.

But they still have challenges with respect to liquidity, particularly for the small and midsized customers, and their exports, particularly given the impact of Europe to their export industries, continues to be a challenge. So we see China as having another tough year. But a tough year for them means it's still meaningful growth. GDP has dropped down into the 7s with the last one continuing to bring it down. They're going through a leadership change. I think this first quarter here, it'll be a little bit uncertain, and I think we'll get a little more clarity as to what that does positive or negative as we get past the Chinese New Year. So we see China as mixed at this point in time. And we're still very optimistic and bullish on China in the long term, but we have to get through the current environment."

Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year and some commentary on our outlook. Then Ted will review the results for the quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2013. He will also spend some time today going through the components of pension expense, our new definition of segment operating earnings and our new non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings per share. We'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. 
Our results today were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. In addition, our supplemental financial data document is available on our website, and it includes reconciliations to our new non-GAAP EPS and segment earnings by quarter for 2008 through 2012. 
A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. We appreciate you starting your week with us today. We've got a lot to cover, so the call may go a little bit longer than an hour. 
Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. 
So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith."

Let me start by saying to anyone affected by last week's hurricane and its aftermath that I appreciate your efforts to join our call today. I hope you were able to stay out of harm's way. 
I'll start with highlights for the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. I was pleased with 5% organic growth, especially given the tough comparison to last year's very strong fourth quarter. Growth rates continued to moderate due to the difficult economic environment, but once again, we had organic growth in all regions. Emerging markets grew 11% in the quarter with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. 
Most of the growth this quarter came from our solutions businesses as our product businesses were essentially flat compared to last year. Process had another great quarter with 18% growth. 
In the quarter, we initiated restructuring actions with corresponding charges of about $13 million. We're calling this out because the charges are considerably higher than a normal run rate for pay-as-you-go actions. These restructuring actions provide us with some headroom to rebalance investments in 2013. 
Earnings per share were $1.38, about $0.01 lower than last year. Restructuring charges reduced EPS by about $0.07. Cash flow in the quarter was strong, and we repurchased another 1.4 million shares. So overall, a good end to a very solid year. 
I'll make a few comments on the full year before I move to our outlook. We entered 2012 in the midst of global economic uncertainty, and that is still the prevailing environment. The prospects of a fiscal cliff in the U.S., the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the slowdown in key emerging markets all weighed on economic growth this year. Despite that, we delivered organic growth of 6% for the full year and ended the year with record sales of up over $6.2 billion. 
Canada had very strong growth of 20%, reflecting continued strength in the resource-based industries. Mexico also grew 20%, and industrial activity there remained strong. But our European region was the real standout with 6% organic growth in the face of a recession. I was encouraged that we grew in both developed and emerging EMEA, and I want to our acknowledge the EMEA leadership team who executed very well within difficult market conditions. 
It's not on the chart, but Process sales grew 20% for the full year, and we continue to win both batch and continuous process applications. I was pleased that we were able to expand segment operating margin a full point while continuing to invest for growth. 
Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year and repurchase 3.7 million shares. We're proud of our track record of returning cash to share owners. 
We delivered solid results in a challenging environment this year. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers, suppliers and partners for their continued support throughout the year. 
So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2013. Growth rates moderated considerably as we moved through fiscal '12, and our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat. We saw an increase in project delays in Q4 and ended the year with a lower solutions backlog than a year ago. So there's not a lot of positive momentum as we enter the new year.  
Each region has its own story, but the global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam at the moment. We continue to believe this is a pause in the recovery and not an inflection point, which is consistent with what we are hearing from our sales organization, our channel partners and customers. The forecast that we monitor for GDP and industrial production call for growth next year. But consistent with those forecasts and given current conditions and our lower backlog, we don't expect to see much growth until the second half of 2013. 
It's possible that the current global economic sluggishness is creating some pent-up demand for manufacturing investment. If that is true, a couple of positive macroeconomic signals could give customers confidence to accelerate their spending. We're counting on market conditions improving early enough to have a positive impact on the second half of our fiscal 2013. We're excited about and counting on new products to help us grow next year, even in sluggish market conditions. 
From a regional perspective, we expect the U.S. to stay on a low growth track, and we don't think Europe gets any worse. Asia Pacific and Latin America should have higher growth rates next year, driven primarily by improvements in China and Brazil. 
With all of that said, we expect total sales growth of 2% to 6% next year. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Although we can't control the economy, we know how to remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. In the end, with our great technology, talented and dedicated employees, loyal partners, robust installed base and share gain opportunities, we're well positioned to continue to outperform the market. 
Before I wrap up, I want to assure you that Automation affair -- Automation Fair events this week will continue as planned. Downtown Philadelphia, the convention center and hotels sustained minimal or no damage. We feel extremely fortunate that Automation Fair, its supporting events and our investor conference will proceed as scheduled. But the people in businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy do remain in our thoughts. For those of you who haven't been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. It is a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers. 
At the investor conference on Thursday, you'll hear from John McDermott, the leader of our global sales and marketing team, and from one of our major global customers. Then we will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor. After lunch, we will hold a webcast where you will learn more about our strategy and progress from me and Ted. Frank Kulaszewicz, the Head of our Architecture & Software segment, and Blake Moret, the Head of our Control Products & Solutions segment, will provide a deeper dive into 2 of our best growth opportunities, process and OEMs. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us, and we look forward to seeing you there.  
So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2013. Ted?"
300504,223285525,378220,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2012",2012-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everybody. A lot to cover this morning, and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000. That's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth wa",2061,"Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everybody. A lot to cover this morning, and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000. That's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was 5%, and the year-over-year impact of currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points. Segment operating earnings were $295 million, down 1% compared to last year. 
As Keith mentioned, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $13 million in the quarter. General corporate net expense was $20.6 million compared to $22.2 million a year ago. The effect of tax rate in the quarter was 23.4%. That's 2.2 points higher than fourth quarter last year. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.38, down $0.01 compared to Q4 last year. The restructuring charges reduced earnings per share by about $0.07 cents. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 141.5 million. In Q4, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $96 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares at a cost of $265 million. On the earnings call in July, we projected to repurchase about 3 million shares for the full year, so we were more aggressive than that in the quarter.  
Turning to Page 6. Fourth quarter results were up for automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see that sales increased only slightly from last year. That's the currency effect offsetting the 5% organic growth. You might remember that Q4 fiscal '11 was a particularly strong quarter, especially in our solutions and services businesses, and sales in the fourth quarter this year were up 7% sequentially. 
Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart. Segment operating margin in Q4 was 17.7%, down a bit from 18% in Q4 last year. Lots of puts and takes on margin in the quarter, but the $13 million in restructuring charges reduced operating margin by about 80 basis points. So margin would have been about 18.5% without those charges, and I think that would've been pretty much as expected. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 30.3%, about the same as last quarter.  
Moving on to Page 7. This slide displays the Q4 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $671 million in the quarter, down about 2% year-over-year. Organic growth of 3% was more than offset by a currency translation impact that reduced sales by 5 points. Sequentially, Architecture & Software sales increased 1%. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.8%, down 1.2 points from Q4 last year. About 1/2 of the restructuring charges were incurred in this segment. Excluding those charges, margins were down about 20 basis points compared to last year. 
The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Control Products & Solutions sales in Q4 were $993 million. That's up 2% from a year ago. Currency translation reduced sales by 4 points, so organic growth was 6%. Sales in the product portion of CP&S in Q4 were down a little year-over-year, but sales for the solutions and service businesses were up 12%, a pretty strong performance, and as I mentioned earlier, against the difficult year-ago comparison for the solutions and services businesses. 
However, orders for solutions and services were weak in the quarter. The book-to-bill was only 0.8. It's typical for the solutions and services book-to-bill to be below one in our fourth quarter, but 0.8 is lower than normal. As Keith mentioned, we saw an increasing number of projects being delayed in Q4, particularly larger projects, and that was pretty much the case in all regions. Our backlog in the solutions and services businesses is down approximately 7% compared to this time last year. 
Moving to the right side of the slide. Segment operating earnings increased 7% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded by 0.6 to 13%. Control Products & Solutions also incurred about 1/2 of the restructuring charges, which reduced margins in the quarter by about 0.6 points. That offset some of the benefit of higher volume.  
Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column that displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects. As we discussed on the last earnings call, growth rates have clearly moderated from earlier in the year. Despite that, as Keith mentioned, we realized organic growth in every region in Q4. Canada has been consistently strong this year with 18% organic growth this quarter. 
EMEA organic growth was 7%, better than we expected coming into the quarter. We're continuing to benefit from our success with OEM customers and saw particularly strong growth in the emerging countries in this region. 
Asia Pacific was up only 2% compared to fourth quarter last year. There was very mixed performance across the countries in the region. China was up 11% year-over-year. India was about flat to Q4 last year, and Australia was down significantly. 
Latin America was up 8% compared to Q4 last year, and that was with Brazil down about 4%. There was continued strong growth in the balance of the Latin American region and, particularly, in Mexico.  
I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $347 million. The conversion on net income was 178%. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $598 million. That represents conversion on net income of 81%. And if you exclude the discretionary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter, conversion for the full year would've been 105%. So that's the fourth quarter. 
I'll turn now to Page 11 for a summary of the full year results for fiscal '12. Sales reached $6,259,000,000 for the full year, up 4%. Organic growth was 6%. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3 points, and acquisitions added a little less than 1 point. Segment operating margin for the full year was 18.1%, up 1 full point from last year. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $5.13, up 7% compared to last year, and I think Keith already mentioned that this represents another year of record sales and EPS for the company. 
Since we already covered cash flow, I'll move to Slide 12, which describes the new approach we're taking to the way we deal with pension expense and some of our earnings measures. Significant declines in interest rates over the past several years have caused an extraordinary increase in our pension expense. We consider a large portion of that pension expense increase to be unrelated to our underlying operating performance. Because of this, beginning in fiscal '13, we've decided to introduce new non-GAAP measures that exclude nonoperating pension cost from our income from continuing operations and corresponding EPS, and we are also changing our definition of segment operating earnings to exclude the nonoperating pension class. 
As shown on the right side of the slide, we're defining nonoperating pension costs to include defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any planned curtailments or settlements. We consider service costs related to active employees to be operating pension costs. We believe that the nonoperating components of pension costs are more related to financial market factors and that excluding them presents an earnings picture more reflective of our underlying operating performance and also allows for more relevant historical comparisons.  
Let's turn to Slide 13. This next slide provides a sense of the extent to which the nonoperating pension costs have impacted our results over time and why we think it's important to provide better visibility of that impact. The 3 columns to the left display the operating and nonoperating components of pension expense for fiscal 2008 and 2012, along with our projection of pension expense for fiscal 2013. 
The far right column, which is labeled 2013 better than, worse than 2008, shows the difference in the components of pension expense between those 2 years. In the 5-year period, total GAAP pension expense increased by $140 million. You can see that total at the bottom of the column. That total GAAP pension expense increase represents more than a 2-point negative impact on operating margins in 2013 compared to 2008. The nonoperating component of that pension expense increase is $104 million or almost 75% of the increase. We think it's important for investors to understand the impact of the nonoperating pension expense. 
The second column from the right side of the slide shows the difference between the components of pension expense for 2012 compared to 2013. For 2013, we're projecting a $64 million increase in the total GAAP pension expense. The nonoperating portion of that increase is $44 million or about 70% of the increase. It's important to note that even with this change, there's still a $20 million increase in the operating pension cost in 2013. The operating pension cost will continue to be included in our segment operating earnings. 
The next slide, Slide 14, provides a walk from our fiscal 2012 GAAP results to the new non-GAAP measures so that we can provide investors with a consistent comparison against our fiscal '13 guidance. Focusing on the middle column, which displays the adjustments, I'll start with segment operating earnings, which would have been $32.5 million higher in fiscal '12 under the new definition of segment operating earnings. General corporate net expense would've been $2.7 million lower, so total income before taxes would've been $35.2 million higher. After tax, that yields an earnings per share add back of $0.16. So adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '12 would've been $5.29 compared to $5.13 as reported. 
Segment operating margin increases by 0.5 point under the new definition of segment operating earnings to 18.6%, and the effective tax rate also increases by about 40 basis points. As Rondi mentioned at the beginning of the call, reconciliations of earnings per share and segment operating earnings annually and by quarter back to 2008 are available in the supplemental data book that's posted to our external website. 
So now let me turn to Slide 15, and we can discuss guidance for fiscal year '13. Regarding the top line, Keith provided a good deal of color on our views of the economic and market environment we're expecting in 2013. I'll repeat just a couple of key points: growth rates moderated throughout fiscal '12, our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat and there's not much positive momentum as we enter the new year. The global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam, but we still think this is a pause, not an inflection point. We expect to see improved market conditions in 2013, but we don't expect to see any significant improvement until the latter part of the year. 
Given that context, we expect fiscal 2013 sales to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.65 billion. That's 1% to 5% organic growth. We expect currency and acquisitions to each add about 0.5 point of growth. So that's the makeup of the 2% to 6% growth that Keith highlighted. 
We expect segment operating margin to be about 18.7%. That compares to the restated fiscal '12 segment operating margin of 18.6%. Think of the 18.7% as the midpoint of guidance, so maybe a little bit higher or lower across the sales range. Not a significant margin improvement year-over-year, but at the midpoint, we're at a relatively modest 3% organic growth. And even with our new definition of segment operating earnings, we're absorbing a $20 million increase in pension expense. 
As Keith noted, our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.35 to $5.75, and that compares to EPS of $5.29 for fiscal '12 on an adjusted basis. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted net income of about 100% in fiscal '13. And then maybe a couple of other items that aren't shown here: we expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $83 million, about equal to fiscal '12; we expect an effective tax rate in fiscal '13 of about 26%; and we expect the average share count next year to be between 139 million and 140 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin the Q&A session"

And the question will be, I think, how do some of these other factors play out over the next couple of months, particularly the fiscal cliff and elections in the U.S. and the debt and the euro crisis potential that remains in Europe. So I think those are the factors that we need to get some, I'll just say, better clarity and certainty around to be able to understand what is going on.

So I would say the activity remains constant, or relatively constant. But the decision making is taking longer to close orders than it had in the first half of our fiscal '12.

Some of that is driven by labor situations, such as you have in South Africa. Some of it is demand from China and India impacting Australia, and some of it is just the environmental issues associated with some of the large new mines, particularly in Latin America. So it's probably created a slowing of investments, and I think that's the area that we see it the most.

And the emerging markets are kind of just -- I think you see a little mix there with the emerging markets that have strong exporting, wondering what's happening in the U.S. and Western Europe. And I think where the ongoing positive activity is, is in their indigenous markets and, in particular, in some of the automotive, some of the consumer product areas. That's where we see the least dependence upon what's going on in the rest of the world in those emerging markets and, really, what is the form of government stimulus that is being applied there, which, traditionally, is much more infrastructure types of projects.
