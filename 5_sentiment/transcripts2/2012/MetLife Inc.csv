We'll be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, and in our earnings press release, our supplements and in the other financial information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on a GAAP net income.
I would also like to bring your attention to one item. As noted in our press release during the fourth quarter 2011, MetLife began reporting certain operations of MetLife Bank and Insurance operations in the Caribbean region, Panama and Costa Rica as divested businesses. As a result, we have modified our definition of operating earnings to exclude the impact of these divested businesses and prior periods have been reclassified to confirm -- conform to the current period segment presentation.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric, interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steven Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Toppeta, Vice President of EMEA and Asia. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve."

Let me begin this morning by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010 and our operating",1717,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010 and our operating return on shareholders equity was 11%, up 100 basis points from 10% in 2010.
These results are even more noteworthy in light of a challenging external environment the insurance industry faced in 2011. The global macroeconomic environment remain volatile. Interest rates declined, equity markets were flat and several natural disasters in both the United States and Japan drove up claims.
Adjusting for certain one-time items, which we discussed at our December investor call, MetLife's 2011 operating earnings would have been $5.25 per share.
cap thing a solid 2011 was a strong fourth quarter MetLife delivered operating earnings per share of $1.31, up 11% year-over-year. In our U.S. Businesses, underwriting discipline continued to produce favorable results in Group Life with a loss ratio of 85.2%, as well as in dental.
In addition, core spreads are relatively stable despite the low interest rate environment, largely as a result of our disciplined asset liability management, our hedging strategies and our private asset origination capabilities.
Outside the United States, we continue to be pleased with our financial results and our progress in integrating Alico. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales increased by 12% on a combined basis while premiums, fees and other revenue rose by 1%. We generated $570 million in operating earnings on $3.8 billion of premiums, fees and other revenues.
Top line growth was negatively impacted by the disposition of noncore businesses, nonrenewals of certain large group accounts and the accounting impact of a shift towards savings products.
In Japan, sales increased in the bank and in the channels. In other international regions, will benefit of our acquisition in Turkey and in leveraging of our accident health capabilities in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Total sales of A&H, a low capital, high-hourly product increased roughly 25% year-over-year.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth of our non-U.S. businesses. As we said on our December investor call, we expect to grow operating earnings by roughly 14% outside of the United States in 2012, after adjusting for the new accounting treatment of deferred acquisition costs.
One final note for the quarter concerns variable annuity sales. As we discussed in our last call, we sold $8.6 billion of VAs in the third quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, VA sales declined 16% to $7.2 billion in line with our expectations.
As I have said previously, one of our guiding principles at MetLife is to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Consistent with that principle, we are committed to actively managing the level of our VA sales.
In January, we once again reduced the rollup rate in our GMIB Max product from 5.5% to 5%. This change is having the desired effect. VA sales in the early part of the year are tracking with our 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, consistent with the level of VA sales prior to 2011.
With the management actions we are taking, we are confident that VA sales will remain an important part of our overall product mix.
Despite the low interest rate environment in which we're operating, MetLife's businesses continue to generate excess capital. We finished 2011 where we expected with $3.5 billion of deployable capital.
By the end of 2012, we anticipate deployable capital to grow to $6 billion to $7 billion before any deployments. As I previously mentioned, it is our intention to begin returning excess capital to shareholders this year, pending regulatory approval.
In January, we submitted our 2012 capital plan to the Federal Reserve and expect to receive a response before the end of the first quarter.
Qualitatively, we believe we have developed a robust, forward-looking capital planning process consistent with the Fed's guidelines. Quantitatively, we specifically designed our capital plan to meet the Fed's requirement that we have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress.
Finally, we believe that approval of our capital plan is consistent with the Fed's mandate to promote maximum deployment as MetLife shareholders would redeploy idle capital in a more productive manner.
At the same time, we continue to move forward with our plans to seize being a bank holding company. On December 27, 2011, we announced the sale of our depository business GE capital, which we expect to close during the second quarter.
In addition, we are writing -- winding down our Ford Mortgage business and exiting our Warehouse Finance business through asset sales to ever bank.
Further down the road, a number of insurance companies face the possibility of being named non-bank systemically important financial institutions. To be clear, we do not believe the Life Insurance business poses systemic risk to the U.S. economy and we look forward to continuing to meet with policymakers to convey our position.
The business of Life Insurance is highly regulated with strict capital reserve and derivative use requirements. With regard to derivatives, we are one -- which are one of the key aspects that our business of regulators will examine, we are well collateralized and our third-party exposure as well diversified providing production to policy holders and shareholders alike.
Just as our decision to reduce VA sales as part of our commitment to managing our portfolio of products, MetLife also continues to manage it portfolio of markets.
In November, we announced that we are divesting our businesses in the Caribbean, Panama and Costa Rica. And last month, we announced our plans to acquire from Aviva PLC, its life insurance businesses in eastern Europe, which will expand MetLife's presence in growth markets.
As I said on our December investor call, we're going to invest in those markets that we consider core and divest from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements.
Now let me turn to strategy and our recent organizational changes.
As CEO of MetLife, I believe it is important for us to continuously reassess our strategy especially in light of the uncertain external environment. We'll provide details of our current strategic review in our next investor event on May 23.
You've already heard me say that capital is precious and we must limit its use to those activities that can best create long-term shareholder value.
Of course, having the right strategy is not sufficient. On our earnings call last July, I' outlined some of my key priorities to ensure that MetLife is equipped to deliver strong business results. I spoke of the importance of maximizing the value of our brand, which we have done with the naming rights to MetLife stadium, our extensive rebranding efforts in key Alico markets such as Japan and our new U.S. advertising campaign launched during the Super Bowl.
I discussed sharpening our focus on value creation and emphasized to our senior leaders that we must pursue profitable growth with returns that exceed our cost of capital.
And I described MetLife's commitment to recruiting top talent, which is our guiding principle in selecting a new CFO and President of Asia.
Last November, I also announced that MetLife was reorganizing from a U.S. and international structure into 3 broad geographic regions: The Americas, EMEA and Asia, and creating a global employee benefits business. We are continuing to implement that reorganization plan and have taken a number of additional steps to enhance our operating model.
Today, I like to give you a high-level overview of our Americas division. Under the leadership of Bill Wheeler, the Americas is comprised of the following 6 core businesses: Retail, Corporate Benefit Funding, Group, non-Carrying workside, Latin America and Direct.
Once we have named the new CFO, Eric Steigerwalt will lead the retail business, which includes Individual Life and VAs. What will not change as a result of our new structure is MetLife's commitment to ensuring that customers can do business with us through a variety of channels. For example, even as we were to develop our direct-to-consumer business, we recognize the face-to-face distribution through agents and advisors is critical to our success. Having a diversity of channels is a competitive advantage that enables us to pursue growth in multiple markets simultaneously
The final topic I want to address this morning is the impact of interest rates on MetLife's financial performance. We discussed this topic at length last fall, and since that time the shares of MetLife had traded with less correlation to the 10-year treasury. Even so, when the Fed announced its decision to keep short-term interest rates low through 2014, the shares of life insurers fell sharply that day.
One question we have been asked is whether MetLife's 2012 earnings would be impacted by low interest rates over the entire year especially since our guidance assumed that 10-year treasury would rise from about 2% last fall to 3% by the end of 2012.
The short answer is no. We reran our 2012 projections assuming the 10-year treasury holds constant during the year. The decline in investment income will be offset by income generated by our interest rate floors.
Over the longer term, low interest rates would have impacted MetLife's earnings as we explained in detail last fall. Under this scenario we used at that time, we held a 10-year treasury flat at 2% over 5 years.
MetLife's operating earnings still grew over the 5-year period but at a slower rate. It's important to note that we assume no extraordinary management actions under that scenario.
In reality, we have a number of tools that can and would be used to mitigate the impact of sustained low rates, including pricing, crediting rates and expense management.
To sum up, MetLife had a solid 2011 and a strong fourth quarter. Even in the face of some significant market pressures, our capital position is strong and getting stronger. And our ability to grow operating earnings in the face of low interest rates remains intact.
In short, we think we're the best positioned company in the life insurance sector to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you again for joining us this morning and with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.3",2402,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.30 per share.
You will note this result is comfortably higher than our fourth quarter guidance range of $1.16 to $1.26 provided to you during our Investor call on December 5.
The primary drivers for this outperformance were higher-than-expected variable investment income, lower expenses, and stock market performance in December coming in better than expected.
Overall, I would characterize this is a very good quarter driven by solid underwriting margins, strong and stable core investment spreads, which reflect how well we have managed the business despite the low rate environment and continuing expense control.
Underwriting margins were healthy due to our ongoing pricing discipline. This was most evident this quarter in our group insurance operations with a very favorable mortality ratio in Group Life and in improving benefit ratio in our non-medical health businesses.
In Japan, accident and health underwriting margins continue to be quite attractive. And finally, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 22.3% in the quarter after recasting for the divested businesses in the bank and the Caribbean as John indicated earlier.
Now let me walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights.
First, let me discuss some normalizing items which occurred during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual review of DAC assumptions, we had net positives DAC unlocking and other net adjustments of $27 million after-tax in our U.S. businesses.
In our Insurance Products segment, Individual Life had a net positive unlocking and other reserve adjustments of $65 million after-tax.
The favorable unlocking was driven by policyholder dividend scale reduction on a portion of our Individual Life business and updates to our SOP reserving model in our Universal Life business.
In Retirement products, we had negative DAC unlocking and reserve adjustments of $38 million after-tax. Primarily as a result of a reduction in the long-term assumption for our separate account returns.
This change was due to the higher allocation to bonds that we are seeing in our separate accounts, which is causing the blended return to be slightly lower.
Next, our Auto & Home business have favorable prior year development reserve release and its Auto business of $14 million after-tax. This was partially offset by incurred catastrophe losses of $18 million after-tax in the quarter, which was $6 million above our fourth quarter plan provision of $12 million after-tax.
The net impact of these 2 items benefited Auto & Home's operating earnings by $8 million after-tax.
And finally, Alico integration expenses in the quarter were $20 million after-tax. We have recorded these expenses in our corporate and other segment.
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. In U.S. Business, we reported operating earnings of $932 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of one-time items that I mentioned, normalized operating earnings were $897 million. This reflects solid operating earnings growth of 4% on a reported basis as compared to the prior-year period of $894 million and 9% higher on a normalized basis.
The primary drivers of this normalized earnings growth were strong underwriting results in Group Life and dental, as well as strong separate account fee growth in our Retirement Products segment.
Premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.6 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter driven by higher U.K. pension closeouts in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and higher premiums and fees in Retirement products.
While insurance products top line was essentially flat this quarter, we do expect to see a pickup in 2012 revenue growth consistent with our plan as we are experiencing a nice rebound in 2012 Group Life sales and persistency and continued growth in our Dental business primarily driven by the addition of the TRICARE Dental account.
Auto & Home had solid growth in the quarter as net driven premiums were up 2% year-over-year.
Insurance products normalized earnings of $346 million were up 7% over the prior-year quarter. This strong performance is mainly driven by improved Group Life and nonmedical health underwriting margins.
The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a very favorable 85.2%, below both the prior-year quarter of 89.7% and our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%.
Overall, we are pleased with Group Life's steady underwriting results reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline.
The nonmedical health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 88.9%, which was down from the prior-year quarter of 89.7% and within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%.
Underwriting trends in Dental remain favorable due to more stable utilization and pricing trends. However, disability results were less favorable than recent quarters. Although claims incidents improved in the quarter, we did see higher average claims size and weaker recovery experience.
Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% compared to 82.9% in the prior-year quarter. While direct mortality was good, we did have weaker reinsurance recoverables on some high face amount claims.
Turning to our Auto & Home business, normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $73 million, up 4% versus the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio, including catastrophes was 93.8% for the fourth quarter favorable to the prior year quarter's result of 95.2%. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 90.2% in the fourth quarter generally in line with the prior-year quarter of 90%.
Overall, this was a good bounce back quarter for Auto & Home to close out the year that was materially impacted by record catastrophes and adverse weather.
Retirement products normalized operating earnings of $254 million were up 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Earnings growth was primarily driven by higher fees from growth in the separate account balances of 12% year-over-year.
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings of $224 million were up 8% over the prior-year quarter on a normalized basis, largely reflecting increased net investment income from growth in the general account, which was up 4% year-over-year.
Now let's discuss our businesses in Japan and other international regions. Focusing on Japan first, our Japan operation produced good results for the quarter. Japan's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were a strong $326 million, up 3% over third quarter 2011 driven by solid accident health underwriting results, improvements in persistency, as well as higher net investment income.
Japan sales grew to 16% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to experience strong sales growth in the agency and bank channels. Our expectation is that sales growth will continue to be solid in 2012 but perhaps at more modest growth rates due to prior-year recovery from the financial crisis causing tougher comparisons from our 2011 sales.
The year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter revenues on a combined basis was approximately 5% driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were down 2% on a combined basis as GAAP revenue growth has been dampened by the shift towards FAS 97 products. While the revenue for these products accounted for differently than the risk protection products sold in Japan, resulting in incrementally lower PFOs and higher net investment income, their margins and earnings are comparable.
In our Other International Regions segment, operating earnings were $244 million, down 6% from the third quarter 2011 due to foreign exchange rates and the challenging European market conditions.
However, our Latin America and Middle East businesses continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.
sales grew 9% in the quarter as compared with a combined MetLife and Alico results in the fourth quarter of 2010 driven by strong sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sales growth was negatively impacted by the challenging market conditions in Western Europe and Asia Pacific regions.
The year-over-year revenues decreased on a combined basis by approximately 2% reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%.
Revenue growth within LIR was relatively soft due to our strategic pruning of noncore businesses, non-renewal of some large institutional cases that did not meet our profitability targets and the annual resumption -- annual assumption review in our Korea business which actually has a revenue affect.
Offsetting for these factors, OIR revenue growth would've been approximately 8% of the combined basis.
This by the tragic events in Japan, ongoing unrest in the Middle East and adverse market conditions in Europe, our businesses outside of the United States taken as a whole were within their full-year plan range for sales, premiums, fees and other revenue. We have made significant progress in leveraging our accident health product portfolio by expanding our capabilities into Asia Pacific and Latin America.
As Steve mentioned, total accident health sales increased by approximately 25%, a strong result. These products have low capital requirements, attractive returns and high customer demand in emerging economies, which fits nicely into the guiding principles that Steve has already outlined.
Now let me turn to investments. I'll begin with variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $247 million and within our 2011 quarterly guidance range of $225 million to $325 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $162 million.
While results were in the planned range, variable investment income is lower sequentially and compared to the prior-year driven by lower private equity income reflective of the third quarter market decline and volatility that we've said can occur within these asset classes.
Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses excluding divested businesses of $213 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $163 million after-tax of which $123 million relates to our Greek sovereign debt holdings.
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform extremely well. As of December 31, our valuation allowance is $398 million, down from $428 million at the end of September.
The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 61% from 62% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest.
Additionally, our delinquency rate remains very low and more importantly, our losses recorded during 2011 were only $12 million on a $40 billion portfolio.
With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains excluding divested businesses of $351 million that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and gains in our variable annuity hedging programs.
Lastly, I like to update you on certain European exposures. During the fourth quarter, we continue to manage down our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt. As a result of targeted sales and the recognition of impairments, we have reduced our GAAP book value to $254 million, a relatively modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio.
We continue to reduce our exposure to European banks as well. We sold approximately $250 million of GAAP book value in the fourth quarter for a loss of $18 million bringing the full year 2011 sales total to $3.2 billion.
The sales were focused on those institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, securities with a lower preference and the capital structure and larger absolute exposures.
Looking forward, we believe our remaining European exposure is quite manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio.
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding MCI is 49.02 as of year-end reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13%. Steve referenced earlier how well protected the income statement is in a sustained low interest rate environment. I would add that our balance sheet remains quite strong and is well-positioned to remain so, even in a sustained low rate environment.
As we have previously stated, even if rates stay low for the next 5 years, our balance sheet both on a GAAP and staff basis will only be modestly impacted.
This is the result of managing for the long-term, utilizing prudent risk management techniques, and taking actions prior to the crisis, not waiting until it was upon us.
Let me also provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
As you may recall, our third quarter statutory operating earnings were impacted by an increase in reserves primarily related to the weakness in the equity markets. Included in our fourth quarter results is the reversal of a portion of that position due to the strong equity markets performance in the fourth quarter.
For full year 2011, our preliminary statutory operating earnings and net income were each approximately $2.6 billion.
These results were negatively impacted by catastrophes similar to GAAP and market-related reserve items in 2011.
Our total adjusted capital is at $27.7 billion as of December 31, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%
While we have not completely finished our RBC calculations for 2011, based on our work today, we are estimating our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at the upper end of our guidance range of 420% to 425% that we gave you during our December 5 call. Also, we are estimating that our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis will be within our guidance range of 850% to 950%.
Consistent with our guidance, cash and liquid assets of the holding companies at December 31 were approximately $4.5 billion giving us a deployable capital of $3.5 billion, $1 billion above our holding company cushion.
In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital will be within the guidance range we gave of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions.
In conclusion, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2011 despite the ongoing challenging environment. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth.
Our financial strength is intact, our balance sheet is positioned to withstand a sustained low rate environment and our capital position remains robust.
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we may take your questions."

I guess I would say by the way, just keep in mind when we talk about ROIs, we're talking about fully allocated expenses here, not marginal expenses, that's always important and that's how we look at it, and I think that's the right way to look at it and so we feel the sales clearly we had in the fourth quarter and in the latter part of the year were above our cost of capital, we created value through those sales but we think we need to improve.

In terms of where we think the PFOs will go next year. The total for international as we gave you on the Investor call in December, would be approximately 6% and the breakdown on that is Japan would be a little bit above 5% and then the other regions would be about 6.7%. So I think that there are couple of things that will drive that going forward. The first thing I would say is a big emphasis pretty much in all regions on the accident and health business. We expect that there's going to be a strong emphasis on A&H growth in all regions. In fact, we just came back from Latin America where there's very strong growth in A&H in a number of countries. We're seeing very strong A&H growth in Korea. So I think that trends is very good. Another point I think would be related to persistency. There are a number of management actions being taken around persistency particularly in Japan but also in other places. I think what we saw this year was a little bit of a delay in getting that started and that was related to the earthquake. So we're probably and I've mentioned this before, we're probably about 3 to 4 months late on the persistency initiatives. Nonetheless, the trends is very good. That trend of this year in Japan has improved persistency by about a percentage point and that's going to benefit premiums and fees next year of course. And we expect that there's going to be continued growth with that. So I think those are a couple of the factors that make us confident that we can achieve the premium and fee growth that I outlined going forward."

All right, with regard to Group Disability, I think Eric explained it very well. Incidence rates are actually down, which is a good sign. And the claim closure rates are below plan and below expectations and actually ticked down a little bit in the fourth quarter, which is not good and it's all about getting people back to work. And so that's very much driven by the macro factor. Where that goes from here? We hope it improves, we're not sure. But the way we're dealing with that of course is -- and we have the final thing by the way, which is just unusual is we have fairly high severity in our disability claims and that's just a blip. We don't -- we suspect that will come back down to a normal level of severity probably in the next quarter, but you can never be sure. We were dealing with this and obviously pricing, obviously making sure we manage claims appropriately. But we're -- because the environment is still difficult, we have been raising prices in our Group Disability business for a while. So that lead leads to the competitive environment question. Clearly, we've seen a shift in terms of competitors in terms of how aggressive they've been to obtain business, and that's good. we've seen that both in group life and disability and I think the environment is clearly in part getting better. Okay, and I'll do the last one on hedging. I think just mentioned a few minutes ago. So our hedging costs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with where they were in the third quarter, which means that they're higher than the fee we're charging on the writer, low bit higher. So that's honestly not great but you have to always remember that we're earning a substantial fee on the base contract and that's very important. So that's why we still make a return that's just a little of 15% in the fourth quarter even though these hedging costs are higher."

The numbers that we talked to you about, $6 billion to $7 billion by year-end, of course, that builds over time. So that capital will be there by year-end, absent any deployment. Obviously we'll see what happens in the course of this year in terms of what we do around the areas of dividends and share buybacks based upon on what we hear back from the Fed. And we'll just see what happens in the M&A arena over the course of the year. We look at most any property that's put up for sale. We have very strict criteria in terms of what we will pursue and what price but as we mentioned, we have done some deals recently in Turkey, in Eastern Europe and we're looking at other opportunities over the course of this year. So I can't really say exactly what we'll be doing with that full $6 billion to $7 billion we anticipate having year end over I would say 2-year process because a lot of his offense about what happens in the marketplace in the M&A arena and also depends upon what kind of reaction we get from the Federal Reserve to our submission.

But let me go through the -- some guiding principles. I'll give you some insights into our thinking here. So first, let me start by saying obviously the acquisition of Alico, $16.3 billion acquisition, transformed MetLife. We went from being a largely domestic focused life insurance company to being a truly global business. Now a lot has to happen to catch up with that business in terms of culture, organization and we've been doing quite a bit in that arena as you've heard from us. So that's one issue that we'll be talking more about. We've talked about how easy it is to do business with us and being more customer-centric going forward. And in allowing people to interact with us on the basis that they want to. That doesn't mean excluding channels we're in now, it means we're in addition here in terms of allowing people to interact with us on a number of different basis. Let me add also talent. We talked a lot about our talent here, you already heard about some high-level hires to MetLife and more coming in the area of CFO and President of Asia positions. Another issue to talk about is how we look at our businesses overall as a portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies. And making sure there's a balance there especially when you take into account risk. So your question allude to A&H lower capital charge kind of product, strong ROE kind of product. So obviously we want a good balance between the different products we sell. We told you today that our guidance around VAs for 2012 is roughly $18 billion down from 2011, that's related to our way of looking at risk and making sure we balance this portfolio of products that we offer to the marketplace. And finally I'll just say in terms of guiding principle all of these thing I've just mentioned here before is because we're trying to drive shareholder value, that's the bottom line and if we do all those things well, we will drive shareholder value and we're confident we can do that."

We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our Quarterly Financial Supplements and in the Other Financial Information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
I would also like to bring your attention to one item. As noted in our press release, during the fourth quarter of 2011, MetLife began reporting certain operations of MetLife Bank and Insurance operations in the Caribbean Region, Panama and Costa Rica as divested businesses. As a result, we have modified our definition of operating earnings to exclude the impact of these divested businesses, and prior periods have been reclassified to confirm -- conform to the current period segment presentation.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Toppeta, Vice Chairman of EMEA and Asia. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve."

Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our op",1726,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our operating return on shareholders' equity was 11%, up 100 basis points from 10% in 2010. These results are even more noteworthy in light of a challenging external environment the insurance industry faced in 2011. The global macroeconomic environment remain volatile. Interest rates declined, equity markets were flat and several natural disasters in both the United States and Japan drove up claims. Adjusting for certain onetime items, which we discussed at our December investor call, MetLife's 2011 operatings -- operating earnings would have been $5.25 per share.
Capping a solid 2011 was a strong fourth quarter. MetLife delivered operating earnings per share of $1.31, up 11% year-over-year. In our U.S. Businesses, underwriting discipline continue to produce favorable results in Group Life with a loss ratio of 85.2%, as well as in dental. In addition, core spreads held relatively stable despite the low interest rate environment, largely as a result of our disciplined asset liability management, our hedging strategies and our private asset origination capabilities.
Outside the United States, we continue to be pleased with our financial results and our progress in integrating Alico. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales increased by 12% on a combined basis while premiums, fees and other revenue rose by 1%. We generated $570 million in operating earnings on $3.8 billion of premiums, fees and other revenues. Top line growth was negatively impacted by the disposition of noncore businesses, nonrenewals of certain large group accounts and the accounting impact of a shift towards savings products.
In Japan, sales increased in the bank and independent channels. In other international regions, we benefited from our acquisition in Turkey and in leveraging of our accident health capabilities in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Total sales of A&H, a low capital, high-ROE product, increased roughly 25% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth of our non-U.S. Businesses. As we said on our December investor call, we expect to grow operating earnings by roughly 14% outside of the United States in 2012, after adjusting for the new accounting treatment of deferred acquisition costs.
One final note from the quarter concerns variable annuity sales. As we discussed on our last call, we sold $8.6 billion of VAs in the third quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, VA sales declined 16% to $7.2 billion in line with our expectations. As I have said previously, one of our guiding principles at MetLife is to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Consistent with that principle, we are committed to actively managing the level of our VA sales.
In January, we once again reduced the roll-up rate on our GMIB Max product, from 5.5% to 5%. This change is having the desired effect. VA sales in the early part of the year are tracking with our 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, consistent with the level of VA sales prior to 2011. With the management actions we are taking, we are confident that VA sales will remain an important part of our overall product mix.
Despite the low interest rate environment in which we were operating, MetLife's businesses continue to generate excess capital. We finished 2011 where we expected, with $3.5 billion of deployable capital. By the end of 2012, we anticipate deployable capital to grow to $6 billion to $7 billion before any deployments. As I previously mentioned, it is our intention to begin returning excess capital to shareholders this year pending regulatory approval. 
In January, we submitted our 2012 capital plan to the Federal Reserve and expect to receive a response before the end of the first quarter. Qualitatively, we believe we have developed a robust, forward-looking capital planning process, consistent with the fed's guidelines. Quantitatively, we specifically designed our capital plan to meet the fed's requirement, that we have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Finally, we believe that approval of our capital plan is consistent with the fed's mandate to promote maximum employment as MetLife shareholders would redeploy idle capital in a more productive manner.
At the same time, we continue to move forward with our plans to seize being a bank holding company. On December 27, 2011, we announced the sale of our depository business GE Capital, which we expect to close during the second quarter. In addition, we are writing -- we are winding down our forward mortgage business and exiting our Warehouse Finance business through an asset sales to EverBank.
Further down the road, a number of insurance companies face the possibility of being named nonbank systemically important financial institutions. To be clear, we do not believe the life insurance business poses a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, and we look forward to continuing to meet with policymakers to convey our position. 
The business of life insurance is highly regulated with strict capital reserve and derivative use requirements. With regard to derivatives, we are -- which are one of the key aspects of our business that regulators will examine, we are well collateralized and our counterparty exposure is well diversified, providing protection to policy holders and shareholders alike.
Just as our decision to reduce VA sales as part of our commitment to managing our portfolio of products, MetLife also continues to manage it portfolio of markets. In November, we announced that we were divesting our businesses in the Caribbean, Panama and Costa Rica. And last month, we announced our plans to acquire from Aviva plc its life insurance businesses in eastern Europe, which will expand MetLife's presence in growth markets. As I said on our December investor call, we were going to invest in those markets that we consider core and divest from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements.
Now let me turn to strategy and our recent organizational changes. As CEO of MetLife, I believe it is important for us to continuously reassess our strategy, especially in light of the uncertain external environment. We'll provide the details of our current strategic review at our next investor event on May 23. You've already heard me say that capital is precious and that we must limit its use to those activities that can best create long-term shareholder value.
Of course, having the right strategy is not sufficient. On our earnings call last July, I outlined some of my key priorities to ensure that MetLife is equipped to deliver strong business results. I spoke of the importance of maximizing the value of our brand, which we have done with the naming rights to MetLife Stadium, our extensive rebranding efforts in key Alico markets, such as Japan, and our new U.S. advertising campaign launched during the Super Bowl.
I discussed sharpening our focus on value creation and have emphasized to our senior leaders that we must pursue profitable growth, with returns that exceed our cost of capital, and I described MetLife's commitment to recruiting top talent, which is our guiding principle in selecting a new CFO and President of Asia.
Last November, I also announced that MetLife was reorganizing, from a U.S. and international structure, into 3 broad geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA and Asia and creating a global employee benefits business. We are continuing to implement that reorganization plan and have taken a number of additional steps to enhance our operating model.
Today, I like to give you a high-level overview of our Americas division. Under the leadership of Bill Wheeler, the Americas is comprised of the following 6 core businesses: retail, Corporate Benefit Funding group, voluntary and worksite, Latin America and direct. Once we have named a new CFO, Eric Steigerwalt will lead the retail business, which includes Individual Life and VAs. 
What will not change as a result of our new structure is MetLife's commitment to ensuring that customers can do business with us through a variety of channels. For example, even as we were to develop our direct-to-consumer business, we recognize the face-to-face distribution through agents and advisors is critical to our success. Having a diversity of channels is a competitive advantage that enables us to pursue growth in multiple markets simultaneously.
The final topic I want to address this morning is the impact of interest rates on MetLife's financial performance. We discussed this topic at length last fall, and since that time the shares of MetLife have traded with less correlation to the 10-year treasury. Even so, when the fed announced its decision to keep short-term interest rates low through 2014, the shares of life insurers fell sharply that day.
One question we have been asked is whether MetLife's 2012 earnings would be impacted by low interest rates over the entire year, especially since our guidance assumed that 10-year treasury would rise from about 2% last fall to 3% by the end of 2012. The short answer is no. We reran our 2012 projections assuming the 10-year treasury holds constant during the year. The decline in investment income will be offset by income generated by our interest rate floors. 
Over the longer term, low interest rates would have impacted MetLife's earnings, as we explained in detail last fall. Under the scenario we used at that time, we held a 10-year treasury flat at 2% over 5 years. MetLife's operating earnings still grew over the 5-year period but at a slower rate. It's important to note that we assume no extraordinary management actions under that scenario. In reality, we have a number of tools that can and would be used to mitigate the impact of sustained low rates, including pricing, crediting rates and expense management.
To sum up, MetLife had a solid 2011 and a strong fourth quarter even in the face of some significant market pressures. Our capital position is strong and getting stronger, and our ability to grow operating earnings in the face of low interest rates remains intact. In short, we think we're the best positioned company in the life insurance sector to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."
185648,145846062,257991,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2012",2012-02-15,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.3",2430,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.30 per share. You will note this result is comfortably higher than our fourth quarter guidance range of $1.16 to $1.26 provided to you during our Investor call on December 5. The primary drivers for this outperformance were higher-than-expected variable investment income, lower expenses and stock market performance in December coming in better than expected. Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter driven by solid underwriting margins, strong and stable core investment spreads, which reflect how well we have managed the business despite the low rate environment, and continuing expense control.
Underwriting margins were healthy due to our ongoing pricing discipline. This was most evident this quarter on our group insurance operations, with a very favorable mortality ratio in Group Life and in improving benefit ratio in our non-medical health businesses. In Japan, accident and health underwriting margins continue to be quite attractive. 
And finally, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 22.3% in the quarter, after recasting for the divested businesses in the bank and the Caribbean, as John indicated earlier.
Now let me walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some normalizing items, which occurred during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual review of DAC assumptions, we had net positives DAC unlocking and other net adjustments of $27 million after tax in our U.S. Businesses. 
In our Insurance Products segment, Individual Life had a net positive unlocking and other reserve adjustments of $65 million after tax. The favorable unlocking was driven by a policyholder dividend scale reduction on a portion of our Individual Life business and updates to our SOP reserving model in our Universal Life business.
In Retirement Products, we had negative DAC unlockings and reserve adjustments of $38 million after tax, primarily as a result of a reduction in the long-term assumption for our separate account returns. This change was due to the higher allocation to bonds that we are seeing in our separate accounts, which is causing the blended return to be slightly lower.
Next, our Auto & Home business had favorable prior year development reserve release in its Auto business of $14 million after tax. This was partially offset by incurred catastrophe losses of $18 million after tax in the quarter, which was $6 million above our fourth quarter planned provision of $12 million after tax. The net impact of these 2 items benefited Auto & Home's operating earnings by $8 million after tax.
And finally, Alico integration expenses in the quarter were $20 million after tax. We have recorded these expenses in our Corporate & Other segment.
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. In U.S. Business, we reported operating earnings of $932 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of onetime items that I mentioned, normalized operating earnings were $897 million. This reflects solid operating earnings growth of 4% on a reported basis as compared to the prior year period of $894 million and 9% higher on a normalized basis. The primary drivers of this normalized earnings growth were strong underwriting results in Group Life and dental, as well as strong separate account fee growth in our Retirement Products segment. Premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.6 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher U.K. pension closeouts in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and higher premiums and fees in Retirement Products.
While Insurance Products top line was essentially flat this quarter, we do expect to see a pickup in 2012 revenue growth consistent with our plan, as we are experiencing a nice rebound in 2012 Group Life sales and persistency and continued growth on our dental business, primarily driven by the addition of the TRICARE Dental account. Auto & Home had solid growth in the quarter as net written premiums were up 2% year-over-year. Insurance Products normalized earnings of $346 million were up 7% over the prior year quarter. This strong performance is mainly driven by improved Group Life and nonmedical health underwriting margins. 
The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a very favorable 85.2%, below both the prior year quarter of 89.7% and our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. Overall, we are pleased with Group Life's steady underwriting results, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline.
The nonmedical health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 88.9%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 89.7% and within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. Underwriting trends in dental remain favorable due to more stable utilization and pricing trends. However, disability results were less favorable than recent quarters. Although claims incidents improved in the quarter, we did see higher average claims size and weaker recovery experience.
Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% compared to 82.9% in the prior year quarter. While direct mortality was good, we did have weaker reinsurance recoverables on some high-face amount claims.
Turning to our Auto & Home business. Normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $73 million, up 4% versus the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.8% for the fourth quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter's result of 95.2%. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 90.2% in the fourth quarter generally in line with the prior year quarter of 90%. Overall, this was a good bounce-back quarter for Auto & Home to close out a year that was materially impacted by record catastrophes and adverse weather.
Retirement Products normalized operating earnings of $254 million were up 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings growth was primarily driven by higher fees from growth in the separate accounts balances of 12% year-over-year.
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings of $224 million were up 8% over the prior year quarter on a normalized basis, largely reflecting increased net investment income from growth in the general account, which was up 4% year-over-year.
Now let's discuss our businesses in Japan and Other International Regions. Focusing on Japan first. Our Japan operation produced good results for the quarter. Japan's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were a strong $326 million, up 3% over third quarter 2011, driven by solid accident health underwriting results, improvements in persistency, as well as higher net investment income.  
Japan sales grew 16% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to experience strong sales growth in the agency and bank channels. Our expectation is that sales growth will continue to be solid in 2012 but perhaps at more modest growth rates due to prior year recovery from the financial crisis, causing tougher comparisons from our 2011 sales.
The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenues on a combined basis was approximately 5%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were down 2%, on a combined basis, as GAAP revenue growth has been dampened by the shift towards FAS 97 savings products. While the revenue for these products is accounted for differently than the risk protection products sold in Japan, resulting in incrementally lower PFOs and higher net investment income, their margins and earnings are comparable.
In our Other International Regions segment, operating earnings were $244 million, down 6% from the third quarter 2011, due to foreign exchange rates and the challenging European market conditions. However, our Latin America and Middle East businesses continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.
OIR sales grew 9% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by strong sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sales growth was negatively impacted by the challenging market conditions in western Europe and Asia Pacific regions.
The year-over-year revenues decreased on a combined basis by approximately 2%, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%. Revenue growth within OIR was relatively soft due to our strategic pruning of noncore businesses, non-renewal of some large institutional cases that did not meet our profitability targets and the annual resumption -- annual assumption review in our Korea business, which actually has a revenue effect. Offsetting for these factors, OIR revenue growth would've been approximately 8% on a combined basis.
Despite the tragic events in Japan, ongoing unrest in the Middle East and adverse market conditions in Europe, our businesses outside of the United States, taken as a whole, were within their full year plan range for sales, premiums, fees and other revenue. We have made significant progress in leveraging our accident and health product portfolio by expanding our capabilities into Asia Pacific and Latin America. As Steve mentioned, total accident and health sales increased by approximately 25%, a strong result. These products have low capital requirements, attractive returns and high customer demand in emerging economies, which fits nicely into the guiding principles that Steve has already outlined.
Now let me turn to investments. I'll begin with variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $247 million and within our 2011 quarterly guidance range of $225 million to $325 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $162 million. While results were in the planned range, variable investment income is lower sequentially and compared to the prior-year driven by lower private equity income, reflective of the third quarter market decline, and volatility that we've said can occur within these asset classes.
Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had after tax investment portfolio net losses, excluding divested businesses, of $213 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $163 million after tax, of which $123 million relate to our Greek sovereign debt holdings.
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform extremely well. As of December 31, our valuation allowance is $398 million, down from $428 million at the end of September. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 61% from 62%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate remains very low, and more importantly, our losses recorded during 2011 were only $12 million on a $40 billion portfolio. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after tax gains excluding divested businesses of $351 million that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and gains in our variable annuity hedging programs.
Lastly, I like to update you on certain European exposures. During the fourth quarter, we continue to manage down our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt. As a result of targeted sales and the recognition of impairments, we have reduced our GAAP book value to $254 million, a relatively modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. We continue to reduce our exposure to European banks as well. We sold approximately $250 million of GAAP book value in the fourth quarter for a loss of $18 million, bringing the full year 2011 sales total to $3.2 billion. The sales were focused on those institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, securities with a lower preference in the capital structure and larger absolute exposures. Looking forward, we believe our remaining European exposure is quite manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio.
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding AOCI is $49.02 as of year-end, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13%. Steve referenced earlier how well protected the income statement is in a sustained low interest rate environment. I would add that our balance sheet remains quite strong and is well positioned to remain so, even if -- even in a sustained low rate environment. As we have previously stated, even if rates stay low for the next 5 years, our balance sheet, both on a GAAP and stat basis, would only be modestly impacted. This is the result of managing for the long term, utilizing prudent risk management techniques and taking actions prior to the crisis, not waiting until it was upon us.
Let me also provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. As you may recall, our third quarter statutory operating earnings were impacted by an increase in reserves. Primarily related to the weakness in the equity markets. Included in our fourth quarter results is the reversal of a portion of that position due to the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter. 
For full year 2011, our preliminary statutory operating earnings and net income were each approximately $2.6 billion. These results were negatively impacted by catastrophes similar to GAAP and market-related reserve items in 2011. Our total adjusted capital is at $27.7 billion as of December 31, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%. 
While we have not completely finished our RBC calculations for 2011, based on our work to date, we are estimating that our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at the upper end of our guidance range of 420% to 445% that we gave you during our December 5 call. Also, we are estimating that our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis will be within our guidance range of 850% to 950%.
Consistent with our guidance, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at December 31 were approximately $4.5 billion, giving us deployable capital of $3.5 billion, $1 billion above our holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital will be within the guidance range we gave of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions.
In conclusion, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2011 despite the ongoing challenging environment. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. Our financial strength is intact. Our balance sheet is positioned to withstand a sustained low rate environment, and our capital position remains robust.
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we may take your questions."

But that one technique is it'll depend on the adoption and the investment in that -- in those new funds, which, by the way, have performed very well. So it's nothing to do with how the funds have performed. But you got to change policyholder behavior a little bit to want to invest in those new funds under existing annuities. So I would say they were pursuing a number of strategies to improve the profitability of the in-force block, and that's one of them."

In terms of where we think the PFOs will go next year, the total for international as we gave you on the investor call in December would be approximately 6%. And the breakdown on that is Japan would be a little bit above 5%, and then the other regions would be about 6.7%. So I think that there are couple of things that will drive that going forward. The first thing I would say is a big emphasis, pretty much, in all regions on the accident and health business. We expect that there's going to be a strong emphasis on A&H growth in all regions. In fact, we just came back from Latin America where there's very strong growth in A&H in a number of countries. We're seeing very strong A&H growth in Korea. So I think the trend is very good. Another point I think would be related to persistency. There are number of management actions being taken around persistency, particularly in Japan but also in other places. I think what we saw this year was a little bit of a delay in getting that started, and that was related to the earthquake. So we're probably -- and I've mentioned this before, we're probably about 3 to 4 months late on the persistency initiatives. Nonetheless, the trend is very good. The trend this year in Japan has improved persistency by about a percentage point, and that's going to benefit premiums and fees next year, of course. And we expect that there's going to be continued growth with that. So I think those are a couple of the factors that make us confident that we can achieve the premium fee growth that I outlined going forward."

And the claim closure rates are below plan and below expectations and actually ticked down a little bit in the fourth quarter, which is not good, and that's all about getting people back to work. And so that's very much driven by the macro factor. Where that goes from here? We hope it improves. We're not sure. What -- the way we're dealing with that, of course, is -- and the other final thing, by the way, which is just unusual is we had some fairly high severity in our disability claims, and that's just a blip. We suspect that'll come back down to a normal level of severity, probably in the next quarter. But you never can be sure. The way we're dealing with this is obviously through pricing and obviously making sure we manage claims appropriately. We're -- because the environment is still difficult, we've been raising prices in our group disability business for a while. So that lead leads to the competitive environment question. Clearly, we've seen a shift in terms of group competitors, in terms of how aggressive they've been to obtain business, and that's good. We've seen that both in Group Life and in group disability, and I think -- so the environment is clearly from a pricing -- but getting better. Okay. Just -- I'll do the last one on hedging. As I just, I think, mentioned a few minutes ago, so our hedging costs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with where they were in the third quarter, which means that they're higher than the fee we're charging on the writer, a little bit higher. Now that's obviously not great. But you have to always remember that we're earning a substantial fee on the base contract, and that's very important. So that's why we still make a return that's just a little south of 15% in the fourth quarter, even though these hedging costs are higher."

So that capital will be there by year-end absent any deployment, well, to see what happens over the course of this year in terms of we do run the areas of dividends and share buybacks, again based upon what we hear back from the fed, and, well, to see what happens in the M&A arena over the course of the year. We look at most any property that's put up for sale. We have very strict criteria in terms of what we will pursue and what price. But as we mentioned, we have done some deals recently in Turkey, in eastern Europe, and we'll be looking at other opportunities over the course of this year. So I can't really say exactly what we'll be doing with that full $6 billion to $7 billion we anticipate having by year-end over -- I'd say it'll be a 2-year process, because a lot of this depends upon what happens in the marketplace in the M&A arena and also depends upon what kind of reaction we get from the Federal Reserve to our submission. And as you point out, we are de-banking. Process is underway. We're hopeful that will conclude sometime midyear this year.

But let me go through the -- some guiding principles. I'll give you some insights into our thinking here. So first, let me start by saying, obviously, the acquisition of Alico, $16.3 billion acquisition, transformed MetLife. We went from being a largely domestic-focused life insurance company to being a truly global business. Now a lot has to happen to catch up with that business in terms of culture, organization, and we've been doing quite a bit in that arena as you've heard from us. So that's one issue that we'll be talking more about. We've talked about how easy it is to do business with us and being more customer-centric going forward and in allowing people to interact with us on the basis that they want to. That doesn't mean excluding channels we're in now. It means, really, an addition here in terms of allowing people to interact with us on a number of different basis. Let me add also talent. We talked a lot about our talent here. You've already heard about some high-level hires to MetLife and more coming in the area of the CFO and President of Asia positions. Another issue to talk about is how we look at our businesses overall as a portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies, and making sure there's a balance there, especially when you take into account risk. So your question allude to A&H lower capital charge kind of product, strong ROE kind of product, so obviously we want a good balance between the different products we sell. We've told you today that our guidance around VAs for 2012 is roughly $18 billion. That is down from 2011. That's related to our way of looking at risk and making sure we balance this portfolio of products that we offer to the marketplace. And finally, I'll just say in terms of guiding principles, all these things I just mentioned that are heretofore is because we're trying to drive shareholder value. That's the bottom line. And if we do all those things well, we will drive shareholder value, and we're confident we can do that."

Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and products of the company and its subsidiaries. 
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our Quarterly Financial Supplements and in the Other Financial Information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
I would also like to bring your attention to one item. As noted in our press release, during the fourth quarter of 2011, MetLife began reporting certain operations of MetLife Bank and Insurance operations in the Caribbean Region, Panama and Costa Rica as divested businesses. As a result, we have modified our definition of operating earnings to exclude the impact of these divested businesses, and prior periods have been reclassified to confirm -- conform to the current period segment presentation.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Toppeta, Vice Chairman of EMEA and Asia. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve."

Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our op",1725,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our operating return on shareholders' equity was 11%, up 100 basis points from 10% in 2010. These results are even more noteworthy in light of a challenging external environment the insurance industry faced in 2011. The global macroeconomic environment remain volatile. Interest rates declined, equity markets were flat and several natural disasters in both the United States and Japan drove up claims. Adjusting for certain onetime items, which we discussed at our December investor call, MetLife's 2011 operatings -- operating earnings would have been $5.25 per share.
Capping a solid 2011 was a strong fourth quarter. MetLife delivered operating earnings per share of $1.31, up 11% year-over-year. In our U.S. Businesses, underwriting discipline continue to produce favorable results in Group Life, with a loss ratio of 85.2%, as well as in Dental. In addition, core spreads held relatively stable despite the low interest rate environment, largely as a result of our disciplined asset liability management, our hedging strategies and our private asset origination capabilities.
Outside the United States, we continue to be pleased with our financial results and our progress in integrating Alico. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales increased by 12% on a combined basis while premiums, fees and other revenue rose by 1%. We generated $570 million in operating earnings on $3.8 billion of premiums, fees and other revenues. Top line growth was negatively impacted by the disposition of noncore businesses, nonrenewals of certain large group accounts and the accounting impact of a shift towards savings products.
In Japan, sales increased in the Bank and Independent channels. In other international regions, we benefited from our acquisition in Turkey and in leveraging of our accident health capabilities in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Total sales of A&H, a low capital, high-ROE product, increased roughly 25% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth of our non-U.S. businesses. As we said on our December investor call, we expect to grow operating earnings by roughly 14% outside of the United States in 2012, after adjusting for the new accounting treatment of deferred acquisition costs.
One final note from the quarter concerns variable annuity sales. As we discussed on our last call, we sold $8.6 billion of VAs in the third quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, VA sales declined 16% to $7.2 billion in line with our expectations. As I have said previously, one of our guiding principles at MetLife is to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Consistent with that principle, we are committed to actively managing the level of our VA sales.
In January, we once again reduced the roll-up rate on our GMIB Max product, from 5.5% to 5%. This change is having the desired effect. VA sales in the early part of the year are tracking with our 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, consistent with the level of VA sales prior to 2011. With the management actions we are taking, we are confident that VA sales will remain an important part of our overall product mix.
Despite the low interest rate environment in which we are operating, MetLife's businesses continue to generate excess capital. We finished 2011 where we expected, with $3.5 billion of deployable capital. By the end of 2012, we anticipate deployable capital to grow to $6 billion to $7 billion before any deployments. As I previously mentioned, it is our intention to begin returning excess capital to shareholders this year pending regulatory approval. 
In January, we submitted our 2012 capital plan to the Federal Reserve and expect to receive a response before the end of the first quarter. Qualitatively, we believe we have developed a robust, forward-looking capital planning process, consistent with the Fed's guidelines. Quantitatively, we specifically designed our capital plan to meet the Fed's requirement that we have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Finally, we believe that approval of our capital plan is consistent with the Fed's mandate to promote maximum deployment as MetLife shareholders would redeploy idle capital in a more productive manner.
At the same time, we continue to move forward with our plans to seize being a bank holding company. On December 27, 2011, we announced the sale of our depository business GE Capital, which we expect to close during the second quarter. In addition, we are writing -- we are winding down our forward mortgage business and exiting our Warehouse Finance business through an asset sale to EverBank.
Further down the road, a number of insurance companies face the possibility of being named nonbank systemically important financial institutions. To be clear, we do not believe the life insurance business poses a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, and we look forward to continuing to meet with policymakers to convey our position. 
The business of life insurance is highly regulated with strict capital reserve and derivative use requirements. With regard to derivatives, we are -- which are one of the key aspects of our business that regulators will examine, we are well collateralized and our counterparty exposure is well diversified, providing protection to policy holders and shareholders alike.
Just as our decision to reduce VA sales as part of our commitment to managing our portfolio of products, MetLife also continues to manage its portfolio of markets. In November, we announced that we were divesting our businesses in the Caribbean, Panama and Costa Rica. And last month, we announced our plans to acquire from Aviva plc its Life Insurance businesses in Eastern Europe, which will expand MetLife's presence in growth markets. As I said on our December investor call, we are going to invest in those markets that we consider core and divest from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements.
Now let me turn to strategy and our recent organizational changes. As CEO of MetLife, I believe it is important for us to continuously reassess our strategy, especially in light of the uncertain external environment. We'll provide the details of our current strategic review at our next investor event on May 23. You've already heard me say that capital is precious and that we must limit its use to those activities that can best create long-term shareholder value.
Of course, having the right strategy is not sufficient. On our earnings call last July, I outlined some of my key priorities to ensure that MetLife is equipped to deliver strong business results. I spoke of the importance of maximizing the value of our brand, which we have done with the naming rights to MetLife Stadium, our extensive rebranding efforts in key Alico markets, such as Japan, and our new U.S. advertising campaign launched during the Super Bowl.
I discussed sharpening our focus on value creation and have emphasized to our senior leaders that we must pursue profitable growth, with returns that exceed our cost to capital, and I described MetLife's commitment to recruiting top talent, which is our guiding principle in selecting a new CFO and President of Asia.
Last November, I also announced that MetLife was reorganizing from a U.S. and international structure, into 3 broad geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA and Asia and creating a global employee benefits business. We are continuing to implement that reorganization plan and have taken a number of additional steps to enhance our operating model.
Today, I like to give you a high-level overview of our Americas division. Under the leadership of Bill Wheeler, the Americas is comprised of the following 6 core businesses: Retail, Corporate Benefit Funding, Group, Voluntary and Worksite, Latin America and Direct. Once we have named a new CFO, Eric Steigerwalt will lead the Retail business, which includes Individual Life and VAs. 
What will not change as a result of our new structure is MetLife's commitment to ensuring that customers can do business with us through a variety of channels. For example, even as we were to develop our direct-to-consumer business, we recognize the face-to-face distribution through agents and advisors is critical to our success. Having a diversity of channels is a competitive advantage that enables us to pursue growth in multiple markets simultaneously.
The final topic I want to address this morning is the impact of interest rates on MetLife's financial performance. We discussed this topic at length last fall, and since that time the shares of MetLife have traded with less correlation to the 10-year treasury. Even so, when the Fed announced its decision to keep short-term interest rates low through 2014, the shares of life insurers fell sharply that day.
One question we have been asked is whether MetLife's 2012 earnings would be impacted by low interest rates over the entire year, especially since our guidance assumed that 10-year treasury would rise from about 2% last fall to 3% by the end of 2012. The short answer is no. We reran our 2012 projections assuming the 10-year treasury holds constant during the year. The decline in investment income will be offset by income generated by our interest rate floors. 
Over the longer term, low interest rates would have impacted MetLife's earnings, as we explained in detail last fall. Under the scenario we used at that time, we held a 10-year treasury flat at 2% over 5 years. MetLife's operating earnings still grew over the 5-year period but at a slower rate. It's important to note that we assume no extraordinary management actions under that scenario. In reality, we have a number of tools that can and would be used to mitigate the impact of sustained low rates, including pricing, crediting rates and expense management.
To sum up, MetLife had a solid 2011 and a strong fourth quarter, even in the face of some significant market pressures. Our capital position is strong and getting stronger, and our ability to grow operating earnings in the face of low interest rates remains intact. In short, we think we're the best-positioned company in the life insurance sector to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."
185648,145846062,258124,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2012",2012-02-15,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.3",2422,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.30 per share. You will note this result is comfortably higher than our fourth quarter guidance range of $1.16 to $1.26 provided to you during our Investor call on December 5. The primary drivers for this outperformance were higher-than-expected variable investment income, lower expenses and stock market performance in December coming in better than expected. Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter driven by solid underwriting margins, strong and stable core investment spreads, which reflect how well we have managed the business despite the low-rate environment, and continuing expense control.
Underwriting margins were healthy due to our ongoing pricing discipline. This was most evident this quarter on our group insurance operations, with a very favorable mortality ratio in Group Life and in improving benefit ratio in our non-medical health businesses. In Japan, accident and health underwriting margins continue to be quite attractive. 
And finally, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 22.3% in the quarter, after recasting for the divested businesses in the bank and the Caribbean, as John indicated earlier.
Now let me walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some normalizing items, which occurred during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual review of DAC assumptions, we had net positive DAC unlocking and other net adjustments of $27 million after tax in our U.S. Businesses. 
In our Insurance Products segment, Individual Life had a net positive unlocking and other reserve adjustments of $65 million after tax. The favorable unlocking was driven by a policyholder dividend scale reduction on a portion of our Individual Life business and updates to our SOP reserving model in our Universal Life business.
In Retirement Products, we had negative DAC unlockings and reserve adjustments of $38 million after tax, primarily as a result of a reduction in the long-term assumption for our separate account returns. This change was due to the higher allocation to bonds that we are seeing in our separate accounts, which is causing the blended return to be slightly lower.
Next, our Auto & Home business had favorable prior-year development reserve release in its Auto business of $14 million after tax. This was partially offset by incurred catastrophe losses of $18 million after tax in the quarter, which was $6 million above our fourth quarter planned provision of $12 million after tax. The net impact of these 2 items benefited Auto & Home's operating earnings by $8 million after tax.
And finally, Alico integration expenses in the quarter were $20 million after tax. We have recorded these expenses in our Corporate & Other segment.
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. In U.S. business, we reported operating earnings of $932 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of onetime items that I mentioned, normalized operating earnings were $897 million. This reflects solid operating earnings growth of 4% on a reported basis as compared to the prior year period of $894 million and 9% higher on a normalized basis. The primary drivers of this normalized earnings growth were strong underwriting results in Group Life and Dental, as well as strong separate account fee growth in our Retirement Products segment. Premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.6 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher U.K. pension closeouts in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and higher premiums and fees in Retirement Products.
While Insurance Products’ top line was essentially flat this quarter, we do expect to see a pickup in 2012 revenue growth consistent with our plan, as we are experiencing a nice rebound in 2012 Group Life sales and persistency and continued growth on our Dental business, primarily driven by the addition of the TRICARE Dental account. Auto & Home had solid growth in the quarter as net written premiums were up 2% year-over-year. Insurance Products normalized earnings of $346 million were up 7% over the prior-year quarter. This strong performance is mainly driven by improved Group Life and Nonmedical Health underwriting margins. 
The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a very favorable 85.2%, below both the prior-year quarter of 89.7% and our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. Overall, we are pleased with Group Life's steady underwriting results, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline.
The Nonmedical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 88.9%, which was down from the prior-year quarter of 89.7% and within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. Underwriting trends in Dental remain favorable due to more stable utilization and pricing trends. However, disability results were less favorable than recent quarters. Although claims incidents improved in the quarter, we did see higher average claims’ size and weaker recovery experience.
Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% compared to 82.9% in the prior year quarter. While direct mortality was good, we did have weaker reinsurance recoverables on some high-face amount claims.
Turning to our Auto & Home business. Normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $73 million, up 4% versus the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.8% for the fourth quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter's result of 95.2%. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 90.2% in the fourth quarter, generally in line with the prior year quarter of 90%. Overall, this was a good bounce-back quarter for Auto & Home to close out a year that was materially impacted by record catastrophes and adverse weather.
Retirement Products normalized operating earnings of $254 million were up 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings growth was primarily driven by higher fees from growth in the separate accounts balances of 12% year-over-year.
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings of $224 million were up 8% over the prior-year quarter on a normalized basis, largely reflecting increased net investment income from growth in the general account, which was up 4% year-over-year.
Now let's discuss our businesses in Japan and Other International Regions. Focusing on Japan first. Our Japan operation produced good results for the quarter. Japan's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were a strong $326 million, up 3% over third quarter 2011, driven by solid Accident and Health underwriting results, improvements in persistency, as well as higher net investment income.  
Japan sales grew 16% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to experience strong sales growth in the agency and bank channels. Our expectation is that sales growth will continue to be solid in 2012, but perhaps at more modest growth rates due to prior year recovery from the financial crisis, causing tougher comparisons from our 2011 sales.
The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenues on a combined basis was approximately 5%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were down 2%, on a combined basis, as GAAP revenue growth has been dampened by the shift towards FAS 97 savings products. While the revenue for these products is accounted for differently than the risk protection products sold in Japan, resulting in incrementally lower PFOs and higher net investment income, their margins and earnings are comparable.
In our Other International Regions segment, operating earnings were $244 million, down 6% from the third quarter 2011, due to foreign exchange rates and the challenging European market conditions. However, our Latin America and Middle East businesses continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.
OIR sales grew 9% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by strong sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sales growth was negatively impacted by the challenging market conditions in Western Europe and Asia Pacific regions.
The year-over-year revenues decreased on a combined basis by approximately 2%, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%. Revenue growth within OIR was relatively soft due to our strategic pruning of noncore businesses, non-renewal of some large institutional cases that did not meet our profitability targets and the annual resumption -- annual assumption review in our Korea business, which actually has a revenue effect. Offsetting for these factors, OIR revenue growth would've been approximately 8% on a combined basis.
Despite the tragic events in Japan, ongoing unrest in the Middle East and adverse market conditions in Europe, our businesses outside of the United States, taken as a whole, were within their full-year plan range for sales, premiums, fees and other revenue. We have made significant progress in leveraging our accident and health product portfolio by expanding our capabilities into Asia Pacific and Latin America. As Steve mentioned, total Accident and Health sales increased by approximately 25%, a strong result. These products have low capital requirements, attractive returns and high customer demand in emerging economies, which fits nicely into the guiding principles that Steve has already outlined.
Now let me turn to investments. I'll begin with variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $247 million and within our 2011 quarterly guidance range of $225 million to $325 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $162 million. While results were in the planned range, variable investment income is lower sequentially and compared to the prior year driven by lower private equity income, reflective of the third quarter market decline, and volatility that we've said can occur within these asset classes.
Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses, excluding divested businesses, of $213 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $163 million after-tax, of which $123 million relate to our Greek sovereign debt holdings.
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform extremely well. As of December 31, our valuation allowance is $398 million, down from $428 million at the end of September. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again in this quarter to 61% from 62%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate remains very low, and more importantly, our losses recorded during 2011 were only $12 million on a $40 billion portfolio. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains excluding divested businesses of $351 million that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and gains in our variable annuity hedging programs.
Lastly, I’d like to update you on certain European exposures. During the fourth quarter, we continued to manage down our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt. As a result of targeted sales and the recognition of impairments, we have reduced our GAAP book value to $254 million, a relatively modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. We continue to reduce our exposure to European banks as well. We sold approximately $250 million of GAAP book value in the fourth quarter for a loss of $18 million, bringing the full-year 2011 sales total to $3.2 billion. The sales were focused on those institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, securities with a lower preference in the capital structure and larger absolute exposures. Looking forward, we believe our remaining European exposure is quite manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio.
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding AOCI is $49.02 as of year-end, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13%. Steve referenced earlier how well protected the income statement is in a sustained low interest rate environment. I would add that our balance sheet remains quite strong and is well positioned to remain so, even if -- even in a sustained low rate environment. As we have previously stated, even if rates stay low for the next 5 years, our balance sheet, both on a GAAP and stat basis, would only be modestly impacted. This is the result of managing for the long term, utilizing prudent risk management techniques and taking actions prior to the crisis, not waiting until it was upon us.
Let me also provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. As you may recall, our third quarter statutory operating earnings were impacted by an increase in reserves. Primarily related to the weakness in the equity markets. Included in our fourth quarter results is the reversal of a portion of that position due to the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter. 
For full year 2011, our preliminary statutory operating earnings and net income were each approximately $2.6 billion. These results were negatively impacted by catastrophes, similar to GAAP and market-related reserve items in 2011. Our total adjusted capital is at $27.7 billion as of December 31, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%. 
While we have not completely finished our RBC calculations for 2011, based on our work to date, we are estimating that our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at the upper end of our guidance range of 420% to 445% that we gave you during our December 5 call. Also, we are estimating that our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis will be within our guidance range of 850% to 950%.
Consistent with our guidance, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at December 31 were approximately $4.5 billion, giving us deployable capital of $3.5 billion, $1 billion above our holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital will be within the guidance range we gave of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions.
In conclusion, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2011 despite the ongoing challenging environment. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. Our financial strength is intact. Our balance sheet is positioned to withstand a sustained low rate environment, and our capital position remains robust.
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we may take your questions."

We don't consider those returns adequate. And so obviously that's why we changed the roll-up rate at the beginning of January back down to 5%, and we've also changed a number of other features. I guess I would say by the way, just keep in mind when we talk about ROIs, we're talking about fully allocated expenses here, not marginal expenses, and that's always important. That's how we look at it, and we think that's the right way to look at it.

In terms of where we think the PFOs will go next year, the total for international, as we gave you on the investor call in December, would be approximately 6%. And the breakdown on that is Japan would be a little bit above 5%, and then the other regions would be about 6.7%. So I think that there are a couple of things that will drive that going forward. The first thing I would say is a big emphasis, pretty much, in all regions on the Accident and Health business. We expect that there's going to be a strong emphasis on A&H growth in all regions. In fact, we just came back from Latin America, where there's very strong growth in A&H in a number of countries. We're seeing very strong A&H growth in Korea. So I think the trend is very good. Another point I think would be related to persistency. There are number of management actions being taken around persistency, particularly in Japan but also in other places. I think what we saw this year was a little bit of a delay in getting that started, and that was related to the earthquake. So we're probably -- and I've mentioned this before, we're probably about 3 to 4 months late on the persistency initiatives. Nonetheless, the trend is very good. The trend this year in Japan has improved persistency by about a percentage point, and that's going to benefit premiums and fees next year, of course. And we expect that there's going to be continued growth with that. So I think those are a couple of the factors that make us confident that we can achieve the premium fee growth that I outlined going forward."

And the claim closure rates are below plan and below expectations and actually ticked down a little bit in the fourth quarter, which is not good, and that's all about getting people back to work. And so that's very much driven by the macro factor. Where that goes from here? We hope it improves. We're not sure. What -- the way we're dealing with that, of course, is -- and the other final thing, by the way, which is just unusual, is we had some fairly high severity in our disability claims, and that's just a blip. We suspect that'll come back down to a normal level of severity, probably in the next quarter. But you never can be sure. The way we're dealing with this is obviously through pricing and obviously making sure we manage claims appropriately. We're -- because the environment is still difficult, we've been raising prices in our group disability business for a while. So that leads to the competitive environment question. Clearly, we've seen a shift in terms of group competitors, in terms of how aggressive they've been to obtain business, and that's good. We've seen that both in Group Life and in Group Disability, and I think -- so the environment is clearly from a pricing -- but getting better. Okay. Just -- I'll do the last one on hedging. As I just, I think, mentioned a few minutes ago, so our hedging costs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with where they were in the third quarter, which means that they're higher than the fee we're charging on the rider, a little bit higher. Now that's obviously not great. But you have to always remember that we're earning a substantial fee on the base contract, and that's very important. So that's why we still make a return that's just a little south of 15% in the fourth quarter, even though these hedging costs are higher."

So that capital will be there by year end absent any deployment, well, to see what happens over the course of this year in terms of if we do run the areas of dividends and share buybacks, again based upon what we hear back from the fed, and, well, to see what happens in the M&A arena over the course of the year. We look at most any property that's put up for sale. We have very strict criteria in terms of what we will pursue and what price. But as we mentioned, we have done some deals recently in Turkey, in Eastern Europe, and we'll be looking at other opportunities over the course of this year. So I can't really say exactly what we'll be doing with that full $6 billion to $7 billion we anticipate having by year end over -- I'd say it'll be a 2-year process, because a lot of this depends upon what happens in the marketplace in the M&A arena and also depends upon what kind of reaction we get from the Federal Reserve to our submission.

But let me go through the -- some guiding principles. I'll give you some insights into our thinking here. So first, let me start by saying, obviously, the acquisition of Alico, $16.3 billion acquisition, transformed MetLife. We went from being a largely domestic-focused life insurance company to being a truly global business. Now a lot has to happen to catch up with that business in terms of culture, organization, and we've been doing quite a bit in that arena as you've heard from us. So that's one issue that we'll be talking more about. We've talked about how easy it is to do business with us and being more customer-centric going forward and in allowing people to interact with us on the basis that they want to. That doesn't mean excluding channels we're in now. It means, really, ambition here in terms of allowing people to interact with us on a number of different bases. Let me add also talent. We talked a lot about our talent here. You've already heard about some high-level hires to MetLife and more coming in the area of the CFO and President of Asia positions. Another issue to talk about is how we look at our businesses overall as a portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies, and making sure there's a balance there, especially when you take into account risk. So your question allude to A&H, lower capital charge kind of product, strong ROE kind of product, so obviously we want a good balance between the different products we sell. We've told you today that our guidance around VAs for 2012 is roughly $18 billion. That is down from 2011. That's related to our way of looking at risk and making sure we balance this portfolio of products that we offer to the marketplace. And finally, I'll just say in terms of guiding principles, all these things I just mentioned that are heretofore is because we're trying to drive shareholder value. That's the bottom line. And if we do all those things well, we will drive shareholder value, and we're confident we can do that."

A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
I would also like to bring your attention to one item. As noted in our press release, during the fourth quarter of 2011, MetLife began reporting certain operations of MetLife Bank and Insurance operations in the Caribbean Region, Panama and Costa Rica as divested businesses. As a result, we have modified our definition of operating earnings to exclude the impact of these divested businesses, and prior periods have been reclassified to confirm -- conform to the current period segment presentation.

Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our op",1725,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our operating return on shareholders' equity was 11%, up 100 basis points from 10% in 2010. These results are even more noteworthy in light of a challenging external environment the insurance industry faced in 2011. The global macroeconomic environment remain volatile. Interest rates declined, equity markets were flat and several natural disasters in both the United States and Japan drove up claims. Adjusting for certain onetime items, which we discussed at our December investor call, MetLife's 2011 operatings -- operating earnings would have been $5.25 per share.
Capping a solid 2011 was a strong fourth quarter. MetLife delivered operating earnings per share of $1.31, up 11% year-over-year. In our U.S. Businesses, underwriting discipline continue to produce favorable results in Group Life, with a loss ratio of 85.2%, as well as in Dental. In addition, core spreads held relatively stable despite the low interest rate environment, largely as a result of our disciplined asset liability management, our hedging strategies and our private asset origination capabilities.
Outside the United States, we continue to be pleased with our financial results and our progress in integrating Alico. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales increased by 12% on a combined basis while premiums, fees and other revenue rose by 1%. We generated $570 million in operating earnings on $3.8 billion of premiums, fees and other revenues. Top line growth was negatively impacted by the disposition of noncore businesses, nonrenewals of certain large group accounts and the accounting impact of a shift towards savings products.
In Japan, sales increased in the Bank and Independent channels. In other international regions, we benefited from our acquisition in Turkey and in leveraging of our accident health capabilities in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Total sales of A&H, a low capital, high-ROE product, increased roughly 25% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth of our non-U.S. businesses. As we said on our December investor call, we expect to grow operating earnings by roughly 14% outside of the United States in 2012, after adjusting for the new accounting treatment of deferred acquisition costs.
One final note from the quarter concerns variable annuity sales. As we discussed on our last call, we sold $8.6 billion of VAs in the third quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, VA sales declined 16% to $7.2 billion in line with our expectations. As I have said previously, one of our guiding principles at MetLife is to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Consistent with that principle, we are committed to actively managing the level of our VA sales.
In January, we once again reduced the roll-up rate on our GMIB Max product, from 5.5% to 5%. This change is having the desired effect. VA sales in the early part of the year are tracking with our 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, consistent with the level of VA sales prior to 2011. With the management actions we are taking, we are confident that VA sales will remain an important part of our overall product mix.
Despite the low interest rate environment in which we are operating, MetLife's businesses continue to generate excess capital. We finished 2011 where we expected, with $3.5 billion of deployable capital. By the end of 2012, we anticipate deployable capital to grow to $6 billion to $7 billion before any deployments. As I previously mentioned, it is our intention to begin returning excess capital to shareholders this year pending regulatory approval. 
In January, we submitted our 2012 capital plan to the Federal Reserve and expect to receive a response before the end of the first quarter. Qualitatively, we believe we have developed a robust, forward-looking capital planning process, consistent with the Fed's guidelines. Quantitatively, we specifically designed our capital plan to meet the Fed's requirement that we have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Finally, we believe that approval of our capital plan is consistent with the Fed's mandate to promote maximum employment as MetLife shareholders would redeploy idle capital in a more productive manner.
At the same time, we continue to move forward with our plans to seize being a bank holding company. On December 27, 2011, we announced the sale of our depository business GE Capital, which we expect to close during the second quarter. In addition, we are writing -- we are winding down our forward mortgage business and exiting our Warehouse Finance business through an asset sale to EverBank.
Further down the road, a number of insurance companies face the possibility of being named nonbank systemically important financial institutions. To be clear, we do not believe the life insurance business poses a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, and we look forward to continuing to meet with policymakers to convey our position. 
The business of life insurance is highly regulated with strict capital reserve and derivative use requirements. With regard to derivatives, we are -- which are one of the key aspects of our business that regulators will examine, we are well collateralized and our counterparty exposure is well diversified, providing protection to policy holders and shareholders alike.
Just as our decision to reduce VA sales as part of our commitment to managing our portfolio of products, MetLife also continues to manage its portfolio of markets. In November, we announced that we were divesting our businesses in the Caribbean, Panama and Costa Rica. And last month, we announced our plans to acquire from Aviva plc its Life Insurance businesses in Eastern Europe, which will expand MetLife's presence in growth markets. As I said on our December investor call, we are going to invest in those markets that we consider core and divest from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements.
Now let me turn to strategy and our recent organizational changes. As CEO of MetLife, I believe it is important for us to continuously reassess our strategy, especially in light of the uncertain external environment. We'll provide the details of our current strategic review at our next investor event on May 23. You've already heard me say that capital is precious and that we must limit its use to those activities that can best create long-term shareholder value.
Of course, having the right strategy is not sufficient. On our earnings call last July, I outlined some of my key priorities to ensure that MetLife is equipped to deliver strong business results. I spoke of the importance of maximizing the value of our brand, which we have done with the naming rights to MetLife Stadium, our extensive rebranding efforts in key Alico markets, such as Japan, and our new U.S. advertising campaign launched during the Super Bowl.
I discussed sharpening our focus on value creation and have emphasized to our senior leaders that we must pursue profitable growth, with returns that exceed our cost to capital, and I described MetLife's commitment to recruiting top talent, which is our guiding principle in selecting a new CFO and President of Asia.
Last November, I also announced that MetLife was reorganizing from a U.S. and international structure, into 3 broad geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA and Asia and creating a global employee benefits business. We are continuing to implement that reorganization plan and have taken a number of additional steps to enhance our operating model.
Today, I like to give you a high-level overview of our Americas division. Under the leadership of Bill Wheeler, the Americas is comprised of the following 6 core businesses: Retail, Corporate Benefit Funding, Group, Voluntary and Worksite, Latin America and Direct. Once we have named a new CFO, Eric Steigerwalt will lead the Retail business, which includes Individual Life and VAs. 
What will not change as a result of our new structure is MetLife's commitment to ensuring that customers can do business with us through a variety of channels. For example, even as we were to develop our direct-to-consumer business, we recognize the face-to-face distribution through agents and advisors is critical to our success. Having a diversity of channels is a competitive advantage that enables us to pursue growth in multiple markets simultaneously.
The final topic I want to address this morning is the impact of interest rates on MetLife's financial performance. We discussed this topic at length last fall, and since that time the shares of MetLife have traded with less correlation to the 10-year treasury. Even so, when the Fed announced its decision to keep short-term interest rates low through 2014, the shares of life insurers fell sharply that day.
One question we have been asked is whether MetLife's 2012 earnings would be impacted by low interest rates over the entire year, especially since our guidance assumed that 10-year treasury would rise from about 2% last fall to 3% by the end of 2012. The short answer is no. We reran our 2012 projections assuming the 10-year treasury holds constant during the year. The decline in investment income will be offset by income generated by our interest rate floors. 
Over the longer term, low interest rates would have impacted MetLife's earnings, as we explained in detail last fall. Under the scenario we used at that time, we held a 10-year treasury flat at 2% over 5 years. MetLife's operating earnings still grew over the 5-year period but at a slower rate. It's important to note that we assume no extraordinary management actions under that scenario. In reality, we have a number of tools that can and would be used to mitigate the impact of sustained low rates, including pricing, crediting rates and expense management.
To sum up, MetLife had a solid 2011 and a strong fourth quarter, even in the face of some significant market pressures. Our capital position is strong and getting stronger, and our ability to grow operating earnings in the face of low interest rates remains intact. In short, we think we're the best-positioned company in the life insurance sector to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."
185648,145846062,258389,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2012",2012-02-15,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.3",2427,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.30 per share. You will note this result is comfortably higher than our fourth quarter guidance range of $1.16 to $1.26 provided to you during our Investor call on December 5. The primary drivers for this outperformance were higher-than-expected variable investment income, lower expenses and stock market performance in December coming in better than expected. Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter driven by solid underwriting margins, strong and stable core investment spreads, which reflect how well we have managed the business despite the low-rate environment, and continuing expense control.
Underwriting margins were healthy due to our ongoing pricing discipline. This was most evident this quarter on our group insurance operations, with a very favorable mortality ratio in Group Life and in improving benefit ratio in our non-medical health businesses. In Japan, accident and health underwriting margins continue to be quite attractive. 
And finally, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 22.3% in the quarter, after recasting for the divested businesses in the bank and the Caribbean, as John indicated earlier.
Now let me walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some normalizing items, which occurred during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual review of DAC assumptions, we had net positive DAC unlocking and other net adjustments of $27 million after tax in our U.S. Businesses. 
In our Insurance Products segment, Individual Life had a net positive unlocking and other reserve adjustments of $65 million after tax. The favorable unlocking was driven by a policyholder dividend scale reduction on a portion of our Individual Life business and updates to our SOP reserving model in our Universal Life business.
In Retirement Products, we had negative DAC unlockings and reserve adjustments of $38 million after tax, primarily as a result of a reduction in the long-term assumption for our separate account returns. This change was due to the higher allocation to bonds that we are seeing in our separate accounts, which is causing the blended return to be slightly lower.
Next, our Auto & Home business had favorable prior year development reserve release in its Auto business of $14 million after tax. This was partially offset by incurred catastrophe losses of $18 million after tax in the quarter, which was $6 million above our fourth quarter planned provision of $12 million after tax. The net impact of these 2 items benefited Auto & Home's operating earnings by $8 million after tax.
And finally, Alico integration expenses in the quarter were $20 million after tax. We have recorded these expenses in our Corporate & Other segment.
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. In U.S. business, we reported operating earnings of $932 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of onetime items that I mentioned, normalized operating earnings were $897 million. This reflects solid operating earnings growth of 4% on a reported basis as compared to the prior year period of $894 million and 9% higher on a normalized basis. The primary drivers of this normalized earnings growth were strong underwriting results in Group Life and Dental, as well as strong separate account fee growth in our Retirement Products segment. Premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.6 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher U.K. pension closeouts in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and higher premiums and fees in Retirement Products.
While Insurance Products’ top line was essentially flat this quarter, we do expect to see a pickup in 2012 revenue growth consistent with our plan, as we are experiencing a nice rebound in 2012 Group Life sales and persistency and continued growth on our Dental business, primarily driven by the addition of the TRICARE Dental account. Auto & Home had solid growth in the quarter as net written premiums were up 2% year-over-year. Insurance Products normalized earnings of $346 million were up 7% over the prior year quarter. This strong performance is mainly driven by improved Group Life and Nonmedical Health underwriting margins. 
The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a very favorable 85.2%, below both the prior year quarter of 89.7% and our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. Overall, we are pleased with Group Life's steady underwriting results, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline.
The Nonmedical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 88.9%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 89.7% and within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. Underwriting trends in Dental remain favorable due to more stable utilization and pricing trends. However, disability results were less favorable than recent quarters. Although claims incidents improved in the quarter, we did see higher average claims’ size and weaker recovery experience.
Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% compared to 82.9% in the prior year quarter. While direct mortality was good, we did have weaker reinsurance recoverables on some high-face amount claims.
Turning to our Auto & Home business. Normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $73 million, up 4% versus the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.8% for the fourth quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter's result of 95.2%. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 90.2% in the fourth quarter, generally in line with the prior year quarter of 90%. Overall, this was a good bounce-back quarter for Auto & Home to close out a year that was materially impacted by record catastrophes and adverse weather.
Retirement Products normalized operating earnings of $254 million were up 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings growth was primarily driven by higher fees from growth in the separate accounts balances of 12% year-over-year.
Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings of $224 million were up 8% over the prior year quarter on a normalized basis, largely reflecting increased net investment income from growth in the general account, which was up 4% year-over-year.
Now let's discuss our businesses in Japan and Other International Regions. Focusing on Japan first. Our Japan operation produced good results for the quarter. Japan's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were a strong $326 million, up 3% over third quarter 2011, driven by solid Accident and Health underwriting results, improvements in persistency, as well as higher net investment income.  
Japan sales grew 16% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to experience strong sales growth in the agency and bank channels. Our expectation is that sales growth will continue to be solid in 2012, but perhaps at more modest growth rates due to prior year recovery from the financial crisis, causing tougher comparisons from our 2011 sales.
The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenues on a combined basis was approximately 5%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were down 2%, on a combined basis, as GAAP revenue growth has been dampened by the shift towards FAS 97 savings products. While the revenue for these products is accounted for differently than the risk protection products sold in Japan, resulting in incrementally lower PFOs and higher net investment income, their margins and earnings are comparable.
In our Other International Regions segment, operating earnings were $244 million, down 6% from the third quarter 2011, due to foreign exchange rates and the challenging European market conditions. However, our Latin America and Middle East businesses continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.
OIR sales grew 9% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by strong sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sales growth was negatively impacted by the challenging market conditions in Western Europe and Asia Pacific regions.
The year-over-year revenues decreased on a combined basis by approximately 2%, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%. Revenue growth within OIR was relatively soft due to our strategic pruning of noncore businesses, non-renewal of some large institutional cases that did not meet our profitability targets and the annual resumption -- annual assumption review in our Korea business, which actually has a revenue effect. Offsetting for these factors, OIR revenue growth would've been approximately 8% on a combined basis.
Despite the tragic events in Japan, ongoing unrest in the Middle East and adverse market conditions in Europe, our businesses outside of the United States, taken as a whole, were within their full-year plan range for sales, premiums, fees and other revenue. We have made significant progress in leveraging our accident and health product portfolio by expanding our capabilities into Asia Pacific and Latin America. As Steve mentioned, total Accident and Health sales increased by approximately 25%, a strong result. These products have low capital requirements, attractive returns and high customer demand in emerging economies, which fits nicely into the guiding principles that Steve has already outlined.
Now let me turn to investments. I'll begin with variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $247 million and within our 2011 quarterly guidance range of $225 million to $325 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $162 million. While results were in the planned range, variable investment income is lower sequentially and compared to the prior year driven by lower private equity income, reflective of the third quarter market decline, and volatility that we've said can occur within these asset classes.
Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses, excluding divested businesses, of $213 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $163 million after-tax, of which $123 million relate to our Greek sovereign debt holdings.
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform extremely well. As of December 31, our valuation allowance is $398 million, down from $428 million at the end of September. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again in this quarter to 61% from 62%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate remains very low, and more importantly, our losses recorded during 2011 were only $12 million on a $40 billion portfolio. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains excluding divested businesses of $351 million that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and gains in our variable annuity hedging programs.
Lastly, I’d like to update you on certain European exposures. During the fourth quarter, we continued to manage down our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt. As a result of targeted sales and the recognition of impairments, we have reduced our GAAP book value to $254 million, a relatively modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. We continue to reduce our exposure to European banks as well. We sold approximately $250 million of GAAP book value in the fourth quarter for a loss of $18 million, bringing the full-year 2011 sales total to $3.2 billion. The sales were focused on those institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, securities with a lower preference in the capital structure and larger absolute exposures. Looking forward, we believe our remaining European exposure is quite manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio.
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding AOCI is $49.02 as of year-end, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13%. Steve referenced earlier how well protected the income statement is in a sustained low interest rate environment. I would add that our balance sheet remains quite strong and is well positioned to remain so, even if -- even in a sustained low rate environment. As we have previously stated, even if rates stay low for the next 5 years, our balance sheet, both on a GAAP and stat basis, would only be modestly impacted. This is the result of managing for the long term, utilizing prudent risk management techniques and taking actions prior to the crisis, not waiting until it was upon us.
Let me also provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. As you may recall, our third quarter statutory operating earnings were impacted by an increase in reserves. Primarily related to the weakness in the equity markets. Included in our fourth quarter results is the reversal of a portion of that position due to the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter. 
For full year 2011, our preliminary statutory operating earnings and net income were each approximately $2.6 billion. These results were negatively impacted by catastrophes, similar to GAAP and market-related reserve items in 2011. Our total adjusted capital is at $27.7 billion as of December 31, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%. 
While we have not completely finished our RBC calculations for 2011, based on our work to date, we are estimating that our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at the upper end of our guidance range of 420% to 445% that we gave you during our December 5 call. Also, we are estimating that our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis will be within our guidance range of 850% to 950%.
Consistent with our guidance, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at December 31 were approximately $4.5 billion, giving us deployable capital of $3.5 billion, $1 billion above our holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital will be within the guidance range we gave of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions.
In conclusion, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2011 despite the ongoing challenging environment. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. Our financial strength is intact. Our balance sheet is positioned to withstand a sustained low rate environment, and our capital position remains robust.
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we may take your questions."

In terms of where we think the PFOs will go next year, the total for international, as we gave you on the investor call in December, would be approximately 6%. And the breakdown on that is Japan would be a little bit above 5%, and then the other regions would be about 6.7%. So I think that there are a couple of things that will drive that going forward. The first thing I would say is a big emphasis, pretty much, in all regions on the Accident and Health business. We expect that there's going to be a strong emphasis on A&H growth in all regions. In fact, we just came back from Latin America, where there's very strong growth in A&H in a number of countries. We're seeing very strong A&H growth in Korea. So I think the trend is very good. Another point I think would be related to persistency. There are number of management actions being taken around persistency, particularly in Japan but also in other places. I think what we saw this year was a little bit of a delay in getting that started, and that was related to the earthquake. So we're probably -- and I've mentioned this before, we're probably about 3 to 4 months late on the persistency initiatives. Nonetheless, the trend is very good. The trend this year in Japan has improved persistency by about a percentage point, and that's going to benefit premiums and fees next year, of course. And we expect that there's going to be continued growth with that. So I think those are a couple of the factors that make us confident that we can achieve the premium fee growth that I outlined going forward."

What -- the way we're dealing with that, of course, is -- and the other final thing, by the way, which is just unusual, is we had some fairly high severity in our disability claims, and that's just a blip. We suspect that'll come back down to a normal level of severity, probably in the next quarter. But you never can be sure. The way we're dealing with this is obviously through pricing and obviously making sure we manage claims appropriately. We're -- because the environment is still difficult, we've been raising prices in our group disability business for a while. So that leads to the competitive environment question. Clearly, we've seen a shift in terms of group competitors, in terms of how aggressive they've been to obtain business, and that's good. We've seen that both in Group Life and in Group Disability, and I think -- so the environment is clearly from a pricing -- but getting better. Okay. Just -- I'll do the last one on hedging. As I just, I think, mentioned a few minutes ago, so our hedging costs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with where they were in the third quarter, which means that they're higher than the fee we're charging on the rider, a little bit higher. Now that's obviously not great. But you have to always remember that we're earning a substantial fee on the base contract, and that's very important.

So that capital will be there by year end absent any deployment, well, to see what happens over the course of this year in terms of we do run the areas of dividends and share buybacks, again based upon what we hear back from the fed, and, well, to see what happens in the M&A arena over the course of the year. We look at most any property that's put up for sale. We have very strict criteria in terms of what we will pursue and what price. But as we mentioned, we have done some deals recently in Turkey, in Eastern Europe, and we'll be looking at other opportunities over the course of this year. So I can't really say exactly what we'll be doing with that full $6 billion to $7 billion we anticipate having by year end over -- I'd say it'll be a 2-year process, because a lot of this depends upon what happens in the marketplace in the M&A arena and also depends upon what kind of reaction we get from the Federal Reserve to our submission.

But let me go through the -- some guiding principles. I'll give you some insights into our thinking here. So first, let me start by saying, obviously, the acquisition of Alico, $16.3 billion acquisition, transformed MetLife. We went from being a largely domestic-focused life insurance company to being a truly global business. Now a lot has to happen to catch up with that business in terms of culture, organization, and we've been doing quite a bit in that arena as you've heard from us. So that's one issue that we'll be talking more about. We've talked about how easy it is to do business with us and being more customer-centric going forward and in allowing people to interact with us on the basis that they want to. That doesn't mean excluding channels we're in now. It means, really, in addition here in terms of allowing people to interact with us on a number of different bases. Let me add also talent. We talked a lot about our talent here. You've already heard about some high-level hires to MetLife and more coming in the area of the CFO and President of Asia positions. Another issue to talk about is how we look at our businesses overall as a portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies, and making sure there's a balance there, especially when you take into account risk. So your question allude to A&H, lower capital charge kind of product, strong ROE kind of product, so obviously we want a good balance between the different products we sell. We've told you today that our guidance around VAs for 2012 is roughly $18 billion. That is down from 2011. That's related to our way of looking at risk and making sure we balance this portfolio of products that we offer to the marketplace. And finally, I'll just say in terms of guiding principles, all these things I just mentioned that are heretofore is because we're trying to drive shareholder value. That's the bottom line. And if we do all those things well, we will drive shareholder value, and we're confident we can do that."

A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not acceptable because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. 
Also please note that the financial results for this quarter and all prior periods reflect our new reporting structure as well as the adoption and retrospective application of the new DAC accounting guidance. In addition as provided in our earnings press release, we have recast our 2012 projected earnings by segment to align with the company's new financial regarding structure. In doing so, we have either affirmed nor updated our 2012 projections, which were originally provided in December 5, 2011.

Our bottom line perfor",1040,"Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter. We had healthy top line growth with premiums, fees and other income rising by 7% year-over-year. Our bottom line performance was even stronger. MetLife generated operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share, up 11% year-over-year. MetLife's performance during the quarter was driven by some fundamentals in the core earnings power of our diversified global portfolio of businesses. Erik will discuss our segment results in greater detail. I wanted to provide the high level overview of how each of our geographic divisions is performing. Our businesses in the Americas, which consists of the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay performed very well in the first quarter. In our U.S. Business, operating earnings were up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong underwriting, improving core spreads and rising equity markets. Variable annuity sales in the first quarter were down 13% year-over-year and 32% sequentially to $4.9 billion, consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, our target range for VA sales in 2012 is $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. While our annualized first quarter sales put us slightly above the top end of the range, our expectation is that the product and pricing actions that we have taken will result in sales within the target range. In Latin America, operating earnings were up 22% year-over-year, driven by growth across the region and improved underwriting results. The region saw very strong sales growth in accident health and credit insurance and retirement products. In Mexico, our largest Latin America market, underwriting results for life products remained highly favorable, although increased competition could pressure growth going forward. In Asia, which consists of Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong and China, our businesses delivered growth in operating earnings of 33% year-over-year. In Japan, our second largest market, sales were up 28% year-over-year with all distribution channels growing by double digits. Australia and China saw very strong sales growth although off of a smaller base. Total sales in Asia were 15% while premiums, fees and other revenues were up 8%. 
In our EMEA region, which consist of 35 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, operating earnings were down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates in a challenging economic environment in Europe. Premiums, fees and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year. At our last investor day in December of 2011, I noted that one of MetLife's guiding principles is to continuously reassess our strategy especially given the rapidly changing external environment, that is why we conducted strategic reviews in 2007 and 2009 and began another in 2011. Over the last several years, MetLife has built a solid foundation to deliver value for our customers, our shareholders, employees and the communities in which we operate. Our strategic review has focused on developing a clear roadmap for creating shareholder value. 
At our next investor day on May 23, you will hear further detail on many of the themes I have been emphasizing for the past year, taking a view of the business, treating capital as precious, avoiding growth for growth's sake and earning above our long-term cost of capital. An example of these principles in action is our decision to manage VA sales to appropriate levels. I look forward to talking with you more about the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Now let me turn to MetLife's capital position and plan. MetLife is a financially strong company. At the end of 2011, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies was 450% and the solvency margin ratio for our Japan business was 880%. As you know, we are selling the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital, which is a critical step in our ceasing to be a bank holding company. This action will put us in the level playing field with our insurance company peers. Once regularly approvals has been granted and the transaction closes, registration as a bank holding company is expected to follow shortly thereafter. The actual timing of these events could vary based on the regulatory review process. Yesterday, MetLife also announced that we are exiting the reverse mortgage business. Nation Star Mortgage LLC will acquire MetLife Bank's reverse mortgage servicing portfolio, subject to regulatory approval, and MetLife Bank will no longer accept new reverse mortgage loan applications and registrations. Earlier, we announced the sale of our Warehouse Finance business and the discontinuation of our forward mortgage origination business. Together, these actions will allow MetLife to maintain its strategic focus as global insurance employee benefits leader. We received a number of questions regarding whether we will be designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Let me say first that we do not believe traditional regulated insurance activities generate or amplify systemic risks to the U.S. economy. However, in the event that FSOC names MetLife and other large insurers as SIFIs it will be essential to tailor the new prudential rules to the insurance industries. We are discussing with policymakers the appropriate regularly framework for nonbank SIFIs and we are urging that the new rules reflect the unique asset and liability characteristics of insurers. On the issue of returning capital to shareholders, our first step is to complete the process of de-banking. Once that has occurred, we will examine a range of factors, including the state of the global economy, MetLife's earnings and capital position and the regulatory outlook in the United States, including the potential shape of the Federal Reserve's prudential regulations for nonbank SIFIs. Based on these considerations, we will bring a recommendation on capital deployment to our Board of Directors. As a reminder, any specific announcement with regard to the dividend will be made on October as usual. Let me close by restating my belief that MetLife is well positioned for profitable growth today and into the future. We are outlining the company both strategically and operationally to achieve that growth and look forward to sharing with you on May 23 the results of our latest work. Thank you, again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."
185648,183284259,290973,"MetLife, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share for the first quarter. This quarter's results include a few onetime items, which I will discuss shortly, depressed operating earnings by $0.02",1940,"Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share for the first quarter. This quarter's results include a few onetime items, which I will discuss shortly, depressed operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter, well above our plan, driven by strong interest in underwriting margins, as well as solid growth within all regions as total company premiums, fees and other revenues grew to $11.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. The quarter also benefited from favorable market performance. Interest margins were favorable, primarily due to higher recurring investment results but also from variable investment income which came in at the high end of our planned range. Over time, the general level of spreads will come down if interest rates remain at their current levels. However, as we have discussed previously, we have been able to maintain strong spreads in this environment as a result of our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the use of derivatives. 
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in our group, voluntary and work site benefit segment, particularly in the non-medical health and property-casualty businesses, as well as in Latin America. In addition, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall, expense ratio was 25.2% on a reported basis in the quarter and 24.2% when adjusting for pension and post-retirement benefits. While the new DAC accounting rules elevate the expense ratio, our underlying discipline around expenses remains very much intact. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some highlights. First, let me discuss some onetime items which occurred during the first quarter. As a result of a multistate examination and settlement payment related to unclaimed property and MetLife's use of the Social Security death master file, retail life incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders while our Corporate & Other segment incurred $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the examination payment. This was partially offset by the following favorable onetime items in the quarter, which impacted operating earnings by $22 million after tax or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were favorably impacted by $12 million after tax due to an accident health reserve release in Japan. Our property and casualty business had favorable prior year development reserve release in its auto business of formulae and after tax and incurred catastrophe losses of $17 million after tax, which was $3 million below our first quarter plan provision of $20 million after tax. And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had a few additional onetime items that benefited earnings by a net $3 million after tax. 
Now let me take a look at the results in the quarter by region. In the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.2 billion for the first quarter, up 13% versus the prior year quarter of $1 billion. The primary business drivers for this earnings growth were retail entities, property and casualty and Latin America. Retail annuities brought operating earnings were $280 million, up 37% year-over-year as the business experienced favorable market performance and strong investment spreads. As a result of the S&P 500 being up almost 12% of the quarter, retail annuities had an initial market impact on operating earnings of $38 million after tax due to favorable DAC and SOP 3-1 true-ups. Deferred annuity spreads as reflected in our quarterly financial supplements have achieved a record of 39 basis points in the quarter driven by quarter earned rates by higher fixed income yields, higher derivative income and lower credit rates. Property, casualty earnings were $91 million, up 60% year-over-year as a result of favorable non-cat accident year experience and favorable catastrophe losses, primarily in our homeowners line. The combined ratio for property and casualty was 91.7% and 88.2% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This was significantly below the combined ratio of 98.7% and 92.5% excluding cats in the first quarter of 2011 and well below plan. While we are pleased with these results, it should be pointed out that catastrophes are seasonal and we plan for higher cats in the second and third quarters. Latin America operating earnings were $148 million, up 22% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 30% due to growth across the region and improved underwriting results. We expect Latin America's results to remain strong for the balance of the year. In addition, the nonmedical health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 86.7%, 100 basis point improvement versus 87.7% in the 2011. Results in dental were solid reflecting favorable trends and utilization and disability results were encouraging as the LPD incident rates improved versus the prior year quarter and actually came in better than expected. However, I should point out recoveries continue to be weak. 
Mortality results for the Americas were mixed in the quarter. Group Life's loss ratio for the quarter was 89.1%, higher than the
[Audio Gap] 
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher separate account fees and income annuity premiums in retail annuities, higher closeouts and structured settlement sales in our corporate benefit funding segment and growth in immediate annuity sales in July and universal life and sales in Mexico, which are all in our Latin America segment. 
Let me turn to our aid Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $297 million, up 33% from $224 million in the prior year quarter due to strong growth in the business, particularly in Japan, as well as improved expense efficiency. In Japan, operating earnings growth was driven by favorable results in accident and health and ordinary life, as well as improved expense efficiency. Premiums, fees and other revenues and Asia were $2.3 billion, up 8% from $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenue grew 3% due to business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia, as well as favorable persistency in both Japan and Korea. Japan's premiums, fees and other revenues were up 10% year-over-year, 3% on a constant rate basis. In addition, total sales for the region grew 15% driven by increases in Japan, China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and annuity sales in Japan, accident and health sales in Korea and China and group sales in Australia. 
Turning to EMEA. In EMEA, first quarter results were solid and in line with expectation despite the challenging market conditions across the region. Operating earnings were $76 million, down 4% from the first quarter of 2011 driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus key European currencies and the challenging economic environment. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 2%, reflecting growth in emerging markets within the region. EMEA sales grew 7% compared to the first quarter in 2011 driven by our new distribution partner in Turkey and strong credit life sales. Premiums, fees and other revenues increased 9% from the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 14%, driven by strong persistency and growth in emerging markets. Immediate annuities in Western Europe were also a driver. However, we are evaluating the product in light of the competitive environment there, which may dampen the run rate going forward. 
Now let's turn to investments. Let me begin with variable investment income, which as a reminder now excludes security earnings. Pretax variable income was $239 million and within our 2012 quarterly guidance range of $150 million to $250 million. After taxes, variable investment income was $155 million. Barring any unforeseen market disruptions, we expect variable income to remain within our 2012 guidance range. 
Next let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the first quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses of $145 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $103 million after tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year and within the full year range established on our investor day call. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of March 31, our valuation allowance is $368 million, down from $398 million at December 31. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 60% from 61% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of March 31, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $40 billion portfolio. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax losses of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by the impact of MetLife's credit spreads and higher interest rates. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Lastly, I would like to update you on certain European exposures. As of quarter end, the GAAP book value of our peripheral European sovereign debt was $210 million. In the second quarter 2012, we did participate in the Greek debt exchange and as a result of the exchange, our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt has been further reduced to approximately $100 million, which is a very modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. With respect to European banks, we continue to selectively trim our positions during the second quarter and we believe our remaining exposure is very manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio. 
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding AOCI is at $46.52 as of March 31, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 10%. With that said, I should point out that our ending 2011 book value excluding AOCI was reduced by $2.5 billion or $2.34 per share as a result of the new DAC accounting rules. When adjusting for other equity impacts, the total reduction was $2.3 billion, which was within the range of our guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion provided on our December 5 call. In addition, after tax derivative losses of $1.3 billion that I mentioned previously reduced book value by another $1.23 per share. 
Next I would like to provide you an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The solid results were primarily driven by favorable underwriting and improved market conditions in the quarter. As Steve mentioned, our combined RBC ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies excluding Alico at year end 2011 was 450%. Also, our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 880%. Our results clearly reflect a strong capital position in the U.S. and Japan. 
Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at March 31 were approximately $4.4 billion, giving us deployable capital of roughly $3.4 billion above a $1 billion holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital remains within the guidance range of $6 billion to $7 billion at year end 2012 prior to any capital management actions. In conclusion, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth and our financial strength is intact as reflected in our capital position which remains robust. 
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions."

Having said that, we've lived most of our existence at MetLife under state regulatory regimes which have one set of rules for us. We now as you know as a bank holding company are regulated additionally by the Fed and there are different rules as a bank holding company which we've talked about with respect to the Fed stress test we just went through. So that's why my remarks were cautious in a sense of measuring all this, trying to take into account this changing regulatory landscape that we currently face. We are de-banking there's still the issue of whether MetLife other interns large insurers maybe designated by FSOC as a nonbanking SIFI. So all those factors are taken into consideration when and how returning capital to shareholders. As that landscape becomes clear and as we get into sand de-banking process then we will have more to say about that. And so those things are so moving targets the date no one has been designated yet as non-bank SIFIs. If you're designated as such, the rules are at this point not promulgated. So it's a difficult environment in which to operate from a point of view providing clarity and certainty to our shareholders this very moment about our capital plans. As to U.S. earnings I'd simply say that we had a very good Q1. Erik went through the details of that in terms of what drove those good earnings. As mentioned, we are not changing our guidance. Obviously the strong first quarter puts upward pressure within the range we provided at investor day. And beyond that, I'd simply say that we're heartened by the first quarter, but it's uncertain environment out there in the world today and we're remaining with the current guidance.

So you can think about that. In addition, our normalized basis reported PNC earnings of $84 million. And as I mentioned, we expect higher caps in the second quarter and third quarter. And as a matter of fact versus last year we actually added another $20 million to our cat provision for the second quarter. So I think PNC earnings will come down of the bit in the second quarter.

And often times, the mortality that's gross before reinsurance offsets and reinsurance offsets are just it can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. If you look over any lengthy period of time, our mortality experience is actually pretty good. The pressure on pricing changes and that's really occurring in UL all about interest rates.

And so we and really I think everybody in the industry as well we're all raising prices in UL in this kind of interest rate environment it's just not an attractive product.

I don't really wanted to give them an endorsement frankly. We look at our own hedge cost index. Our hedge cost index went down and not anywhere near where it was in the peak and it was actually down from the last couple of quarters. So my guess is we don't track very well with that index. That's one. Two is in terms of pulling back, remember now we are really going back to sales that we had in 2010, right. 2011 was a bit of an aberration because of the way we priced the new product. And so it is all relevant relative in terms of pulling back. Obviously we have seen people in industry exit this business. And a lot of that has to do with frankly, their historical risk management performance. And they just could not stay in the pain anymore. Our experiences very different and as we have talked about in many different locations about how we hedge this product and how we come through the financial crisis. We think we're in much better shape and we think the product that we sell today has a very good return. So hedging costs are still elevated relative to our pricing assumptions, but just a little bit of, frankly. And that those jump around. So I guess that's kind of our feeling about that."

We had healthy top line growth with premiums, fees and other income rising by 7% year-over-year. Our bottom line performance was even stronger. MetLife generated operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share, up 11% year-over-year. MetLife's performance during the quarter was driven by some fundamentals in the core earnings power of our diversified global portfolio of businesses. 
Eric will discuss our segment results in greater detail. I wanted to provide a high-level overview of how each of our major geographic divisions is performing. Our businesses in the Americas, which consists of the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, performed very well in the first quarter. In our U.S. Business, operating earnings were up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong underwriting, improving core spreads and rising equity markets. 
Variable annuity sales in the first quarter were down 13% year-over-year and 32% sequentially to $4.9 billion, consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, our target range for VA sales in 2012 is $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. While our annualized first quarter sales put us slightly above the top end of the range, our expectation is that the product and pricing actions we have taken will result in sales within the target range. 
In Latin America, operating earnings were up 22% year-over-year, driven by growth across the region and improved underwriting results. The region saw a very strong sales growth in accident and health, credit insurance and retirement products. In Mexico, our largest Latin American market, underwriting results for life products remained highly favorable, although increased competition could pressure growth going forward. 
In Asia, which consists of Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong and China, our businesses delivered growth in operating earnings of 33% year-over-year. In Japan, our second largest market, sales were up 28% year-over-year with all distribution channels growing by double digits. Australia and China saw very strong sales growth, although off of a smaller base. Total sales in Asia were up 15% while premiums, fees and other revenues were up 8%. 
In our EMEA region, which consist of 35 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, operating earnings were down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates and a challenging economic environment in Europe. Premiums, fees and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year. 
At our last Investor Day in December of 2011, I noted that one of MetLife's guiding principles is to continuously reassess our strategy, especially given the rapidly changing external environment. That is why we conducted strategic reviews in 2007 and 2009 and began another in 2011. Over the last several years, MetLife has built a solid foundation to deliver value for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities in which we operate. Our strategic review has focused on developing a clear roadmap for creating shareholder value. 
At our next Investor Day on May 23, you will hear further detail on many of the themes I've been emphasizing for the past year, taking a portfolio view of our business, treating capital as precious, avoiding growth for growth's sake and earning above our long-term cost of capital. An example of these principles in action is our decision to manage VA sales to appropriate levels. I look forward to talking with you more about the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Now let me turn to MetLife's capital position and plan. MetLife is a financially strong company. At the end of 2011, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies was 450%, and the solvency margin ratio for our Japan business was 880%. 
As you know, we are selling the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital, which is a critical step in our ceasing to be a bank holding company. This action will put us on a level playing field with our insurance company peers. Once regulatory approval has been granted and the transaction closes, our deregistration as a bank holding company is expected to follow shortly thereafter. The actual timing of these events could vary based on the regulatory review process. 
Yesterday, MetLife also announced that we are exiting the reverse mortgage business. Nationstar Mortgage LLC will acquire MetLife Bank's reverse mortgage servicing portfolio subject to regulatory approval, and then MetLife -- and MetLife Bank will no longer accept new reverse mortgage loan applications and registrations. 
Earlier, we announced the sale of our warehouse finance business and the discontinuation of our forward mortgage origination business. Together, these actions will allow MetLife to maintain its strategic focus as a global insurance employee benefits leader. 
We received a number of questions regarding whether we will be designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Let me say first that we do not believe traditional, regulated insurance activities generate or amplify systemic risk to the U.S. economy. However, in the event that FSOC names MetLife and other large insurers as SIFIs, it will be essential to tailor the new prudential rules to the insurance industries. We are discussing with policymakers the appropriate regulatory framework for nonbank SIFIs, and we are urging that the new rules reflect the unique asset and liability characteristics of insurers. 
On the issue of returning capital to shareholders, our first step is to complete the process of de-banking. Once that has occurred, we will examine a range of factors, including the state of the global economy, MetLife's earnings and capital position and the regulatory outlook in the United States, including the potential shape of the Federal Reserve's prudential regulations for nonbank SIFIs. Based on these considerations, we will bring a recommendation on capital deployment to our Board of Directors. As a reminder, any specific announcement with regard to our dividend will be made in October as usual. 
Let me close by restating my belief that MetLife is well positioned for profitable growth today and into the future. We are aligning the company both strategically and operationally to achieve that growth, and I look forward to sharing with you on May 23 the results of our latest work. 
Thank you, again, for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."
185648,183284259,291299,"MetLife, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone.

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share for the first quarter. This quarter's results included a few onetime items, which I will discuss shortly, that depressed operating earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter, well above our plan, driven by strong interest in underwriting margins, as well as solid growth within all regions, as total company premiums, fees and other revenues grew to $11.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. The quarter also benefited from favorable market performance. 
Interest margins were favorable, primarily due to higher recurring investment results but also from variable investment income, which came in at the high end of our planned range. Over time, the general level of spreads will come down if interest rates remain at their current levels. However, as we have discussed previously, we have been able to maintain strong spreads in this environment as a result of our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the use of derivatives. 
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in our Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segment, particularly in the nonmedical health and property/casualty businesses, as well as in Latin America. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall, expense ratio was 25.2% on a reported basis in the quarter and 24.2% when adjusting for pension and post-retirement benefits. While the new DAC accounting rules elevate the expense ratio, our underlying discipline around expenses remains very much intact. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some highlights. First, let me discuss some onetime items which occurred during the first quarter. As a result of a multistate examination and settlement payment related to unclaimed property and MetLife's use of the Social Security Death Master File, retail life incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders while our Corporate & Other segment incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the examination payment. This was partially offset by the following favorable onetime items in the quarter, which impacted operating earnings by $22 million after tax or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were favorably impacted by $12 million after tax due to an accident and health reserve release in Japan. Our property and casualty business had favorable prior year development reserve release in its auto business of $4 million after tax and incurred catastrophe losses of $17 million after tax, which was $3 million below our first quarter plan provision of $20 million after tax. And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had a few additional onetime items that benefited earnings by a net $3 million after tax. 
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by region. In the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.2 billion for the first quarter, up 13% versus the prior year quarter of $1 billion. The primary business drivers for this earnings growth were in retail entities, property and casualty and Latin America. 
Retail annuities operating earnings were $282 million, up 37% year-over-year, as the business experienced favorable market performance and strong investment spreads. As a result of the S&P 500 being up almost 12% in the quarter, retail annuities had an initial market impact on operating earnings of $38 million after tax due to favorable DAC and SOP 03-1 true-ups. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, achieved a record of 309 basis points in the quarter, driven by core earned rates from higher fixed income yields, higher derivative income and lower credit rates. 
Property/casualty operating earnings were $91 million, up 60% year-over-year, as a result of favorable non-cat accident year experienced and favorable catastrophe losses, primarily in our homeowner's line. The combined ratio for property and casualty was 91.7% and 88.2% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This was significantly below the combined ratio of 98.7% and 92.5% excluding cats in the first quarter of 2011 and well below plan. While we are pleased with these results, it should be pointed out that catastrophes are seasonal, and we plan for higher cats in the second and third quarters. 
Latin America operating earnings were $148 million, up 22% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 30% due to growth across the region and improved underwriting results. We expect Latin America's results to remain strong for the balance of the year. 
In addition, the nonmedical health total benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.7%, 100 basis point improvement versus 87.7% in the first quarter of 2011. Results in dental were solid, reflecting favorable trend and utilization. And disability results were encouraging as the LTD incidence rate improved versus the prior year quarter and actually came in better than expected. However, I should point out recoveries continue to be weak. 
Mortality results for the Americas were mixed in the quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 89.1%, higher than the prior year quarter of 88.2% and a very strong fourth quarter of 85.2%. That said, the ratio was within our expectations. Retail life mortality ratio was 91.6% in the quarter, better than the prior year quarter of 92.5% but higher than a very favorable fourth quarter of 81.1%. Overall, retail life underwriting results were below plan but we will expect them to return to more normal levels. 
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher separate account fees and income annuity premiums in retail annuities, higher closeouts and structured settlement sales in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and growth in immediate annuity sales in Chile and universal life and AFORE sales in Mexico, which are all in our Latin America segment. 
Let me turn to our Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $297 million, up 33% from $224 million in the prior year quarter, due to strong growth in the business, particularly in Japan, as well as improved expense efficiency. In Japan, operating earnings growth was driven by favorable results in accident and health and ordinary life, as well as improved expense efficiency. 
Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 8% from $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenue grew 3% due to business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia, as well as favorable persistency in both Japan and Korea. Japan premiums, fees and other revenues were up 10% year-over-year, 3% on a constant rate basis. 
In addition, total sales for the region grew 15%, driven by increases in Japan, China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and annuity sales in Japan, accident and health sales in Korea and China and group sales in Australia. 
Turning to EMEA. In EMEA, first quarter results were solid and in line with expectations despite the challenging market conditions across the region. Operating earnings were $76 million, down 4% from the first quarter of 2011, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus key European currencies and the challenging economic environment. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 2%, reflecting growth in emerging markets within the region. EMEA sales grew 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011 driven by our new distribution partner in Turkey and strong credit life sales. 
Premiums, fees and other revenues increased 9% from the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 14%, driven by strong persistency and growth in emerging markets. Immediate annuities in Western Europe were also a driver. However, we are evaluating the product in light of the competitive environment there, which may dampen the run rate going forward. 
Now let's turn to investments. Let me begin with variable investment income, which, as a reminder, now excludes securities lending. Pretax variable investment income was $239 million and within our 2012 quarterly guidance range of $150 million to $250 million. After taxes, variable investment income was $155 million. Barring any unforeseen market disruptions, we expect variable income to remain within our 2012 guidance range. 
Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the first quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses of $145 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $103 million after tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year and within the full year range established on our Investor Day call. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of March 31, our valuation allowance is $368 million, down from $398 million at December 31. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 60% from 61%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of March 31, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $40 billion portfolio. 
With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax losses of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by the impact of MetLife's credit spreads and higher interest rates. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Lastly, I would like to update you on certain European exposures. As of quarter end, the GAAP book value of our peripheral European sovereign debt was $210 million. In the second quarter of 2012 (sic) , we did participate in the Greek debt exchange, and as a result of the exchange, our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt has been further reduced to approximately $100 million, which is a very modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. With respect to European banks, we continue to selectively trim our positions during the quarter, and we believe our remaining exposure is very manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio. 
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, is at $46.52 as of March 31, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 10%. That said, I should point out that our ending 2011 book value, excluding AOCI, was reduced by $2.5 billion or $2.34 per share as a result of the new DAC accounting rules. When adjusting for other equity impacts, the total reduction was $2.3 billion, which was within the range of our guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion provided on our December 5 call. In addition, after-tax derivative losses of $1.3 billion that I mentioned previously reduced book value by another $1.26 per share. 
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter of 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The solid results were primarily driven by favorable underwriting and improved market conditions in the quarter. 
As Steve mentioned, our combined RBC ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies, excluding Alico, at year-end 2011 was 450%. Also, our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 880%. Our results clearly reflect a strong capital position in the U.S. and Japan. 
Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at March 31 were approximately $4.4 billion, giving us deployable capital of roughly $3.4 billion above a $1 billion holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital remains within the guidance range of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions. 
In conclusion, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our margins remain strong, as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth, and our financial strength is intact, as reflected in our capital position which remains robust. 
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions."

The -- I guess the philosophical question is, how are you approaching the view of required capital right now? I mean, it's clearly in a bit of flux, both for you all and the industry, depending on different ways you might measure it versus history. So just curious how you would approach that. And in particular, how are you looking at that as part of your strategic review? And then just a question on the earnings side. I guess the U.S. earnings came in well above plan. How should we think about that as it relates to a run rate? It looks like to me it was a mix of strong investment spreads and good underwriting results. What's your anticipation as to whether or not that's going to be sustained for the balance of the year?"

Having said that, we've lived most of our existence at MetLife under state regulatory regimes, which have one set of rules for us. We now, as you know, as a bank holding company are regulated additionally by the Fed, and there are different rules as a bank holding company, which we've talked about with respect to the Fed stress test we just went through. So that's why my remarks were cautious, in a sense of measuring all this, trying to take into account this changing regulatory landscape that we currently face. We are de-banking. There's still the issue of whether MetLife and other insurers, large insurers, may be designated by FSOC as a nonbank SIFI. So all those factors are taken into consideration as we think about when and how to return capital to shareholders. And as that landscape becomes clear to us and as we get through the bank -- de-banking process, then we'll have more say about that. So those things are still a moving target. To date, no one's been designated yet in nonbank SIFIs. So we'd wait and see more on that. If you are designated as such, the rules are, at this point, not promulgated. So it is -- it's a difficult environment in which to operate from the point of view of providing clarity and certainty to our shareholders this very moment about our capital plans. As to U.S. earnings, I will simply say, we had a very good Q1. Eric went through some details in that in terms of what drove those good earnings. As mentioned, we're not changing our guidance. Obviously, the strong first quarter puts upward pressure within the range that we provided to you on Investor Day. And beyond that, I'll simply say that we're heartened by the first quarter but it is uncertain environment out there in the world today and we're remaining with the current guidance. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?"

Just thinking about a few things that we don't normalize as we consider them part of our business frankly. We did have about $0.04 of initial market impact that helped earnings in the Americas in the first quarter. We talked about the fact that our variable investment income was at the higher end of our range. Our range is $150 million to $250 million, and we came in at $239 million. So you can think about that. In addition, on a normalized basis, we reported P&C earnings of $84 million. And as I mentioned, we expect higher cats in the second quarter and third quarter. And as a matter of fact, versus last year, we actually added another $20 million to our cat provision for the second quarter. So I think P&C earnings will come down a little bit in the second quarter. And finally, we had very good recurring income. We expect that to -- for the most degree, to continue going forward. But it was a very good quarter. So when I say recurring income, investment income, I mean non-variable. So you can think about maybe those 4 categories with respect to adjusting off of our normalized $1.39, Tom."

I think if you added that back, I think individual life had a pretty good quarter. You are right. I mean, mortality is up a bit this quarter. There's a seasonality aspect to mortality. And oftentimes, the mortality report -- remember, that's gross before reinsurance offsets. And reinsurance offset, it's just -- it can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. If you look over any lengthy period of time, we are -- our mortality experience is actually pretty good. The pressure on pricing changes, and that's really occurring in UL, is all about interest rates and the capital that's needed to support the ULSG guarantees. And so we, and really, I think everybody in the industry as well, we're all raising prices in UL. It's -- in this kind of an interest rate environment, it's just not as an attractive product. And because of that, you can see our sales with them this quarter, as we continue to tighten pricing there. So I -- that's, I would say, what's really going on with individual life pricing."

I mean, 2011 was a bit of an aberration because of the way we priced the new product. So it's all relevant in terms of what you mean pulling back. Obviously, we've seen people in the industry exit this business, and a lot of that has to do with, frankly, their historical risk management performance. And they just couldn't stand the pain anymore. Our experience is very different and -- as we've talked about on many different occasions about how we hedge this product and how we've come through the financial crisis. So we're -- we think we're in much better shape, and we think the product we sell today has a very good return.

A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. 
Also, please note that our -- that the financial results for this quarter and all prior periods reflect our new reporting structure, as well as the adoption and retrospective application of the new DAC accounting guidance. In addition, as provided in our earnings press release, we have recast our 2012 projected operating earnings by segment to align with the company's new financial reporting structure. In doing so, we have neither affirmed nor updated our 2012 projections, which were originally provided on December 5, 2011.

We had healthy top line growth with premiums, fees and other income rising by 7% year-over-year. Our bottom line performance was even stronger. MetLife generated operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share, up 11% year-over-year. MetLife's performance during the quarter was driven by some fundamentals in the core earnings power of our diversified global portfolio of businesses. 
Eric will discuss our segment results in greater detail. I wanted to provide a high-level overview of how each of our major geographic divisions is performing. Our businesses in the Americas, which consists of the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, performed very well in the first quarter. In our U.S. business, operating earnings were up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong underwriting, improving core spreads and rising equity markets. 
Variable annuity sales in the first quarter were down 13% year-over-year and 32% sequentially to $4.9 billion, consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, our target range for VA sales in 2012 is $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. While our annualized first quarter sales put us slightly above the top end of the range, our expectation is that the product and pricing actions we have taken will result in sales within the target range. 
In Latin America, operating earnings were up 22% year-over-year, driven by growth across the region and improved underwriting results. The region saw a very strong sales growth in accident and health, credit insurance and retirement products. In Mexico, our largest Latin American market, underwriting results for life products remained highly favorable, although increased competition could pressure growth going forward. 
In Asia, which consists of Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong and China, our businesses delivered growth in operating earnings of 33% year-over-year. In Japan, our second largest market, sales were up 28% year-over-year with all distribution channels growing by double digits. Australia and China saw very strong sales growth, although off a smaller base. Total sales in Asia were up 15% while premiums, fees and other revenues were up 8%. 
In our EMEA region, which consists of 35 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, operating earnings were down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates and a challenging economic environment in Europe. Premiums, fees and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year. 
At our last Investor Day in December of 2011, I noted that one of MetLife's guiding principles is to continuously reassess our strategy, especially given the rapidly changing external environment. That is why we conducted strategic reviews in 2007 and 2009 and began another in 2011. Over the last several years, MetLife has built a solid foundation to deliver value for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities in which we operate. Our strategic review has focused on developing a clear roadmap for creating shareholder value. 
At our next Investor Day on May 23, you will hear further detail on many of the themes I've been emphasizing for the past year, taking a portfolio view of our business, treating capital as precious, avoiding growth for growth's sake and earning above our long-term cost of capital. An example of these principles in action is our decision to manage VA sales to appropriate levels. I look forward to talking with you more about the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Now let me turn to MetLife's capital position and plan. MetLife is a financially strong company. At the end of 2011, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies was 450%, and the solvency margin ratio for our Japan business was 880%. 
As you know, we are selling the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital, which is a critical step in our ceasing to be a bank holding company. This action will put us on a level playing field with our insurance company peers. Once regulatory approval has been granted and the transaction closes, our deregistration as a bank holding company is expected to follow shortly thereafter. The actual timing of these events could vary based on the regulatory review process. 
Yesterday, MetLife also announced that we are exiting the reverse mortgage business. Nationstar Mortgage LLC will acquire MetLife Bank's reverse mortgage servicing portfolio subject to regulatory approval, and then MetLife -- and MetLife Bank will no longer accept new reverse mortgage loan applications and registrations. 
Earlier, we announced the sale of our warehouse finance business and the discontinuation of our forward mortgage origination business. Together, these actions will allow MetLife to maintain its strategic focus as a global insurance employee benefits leader. 
We received a number of questions regarding whether we will be designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Let me say first that we do not believe traditional, regulated insurance activities generate or amplify systemic risk to the U.S. economy. However, in the event that FSOC names MetLife and other large insurers as SIFIs, it will be essential to tailor the new prudential rules to the insurance industry. We are discussing with policymakers the appropriate regulatory framework for nonbank SIFIs, and we are urging that the new rules reflect the unique asset and liability characteristics of insurers. 
On the issue of returning capital to shareholders, our first step is to complete the process of de-banking. Once that has occurred, we will examine a range of factors, including the state of the global economy, MetLife's earnings and capital position and the regulatory outlook in the United States, including the potential shape of the Federal Reserve's prudential regulations for nonbank SIFIs. Based on these considerations, we will bring a recommendation on capital deployment to our board of directors. As a reminder, any specific announcement with regard to our dividend will be made in October as usual. 
Let me close by restating my belief that MetLife is well positioned for profitable growth today and into the future. We are aligning the company both strategically and operationally to achieve that growth, and I look forward to sharing with you on May 23 the results of our latest work. 
Thank you, again, for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt."
185648,183284259,291529,"MetLife, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone.

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.37 per share for the first quarter. This quarter's results included a few onetime items, which I will discuss shortly, that depressed operating earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter, well above our plan, driven by strong interest in underwriting margins, as well as solid growth within all regions, as total company premiums, fees and other revenues grew to $11.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. The quarter also benefited from favorable market performance. 
Interest margins were favorable, primarily due to higher recurring investment results but also from variable investment income, which came in at the high end of our planned range. Over time, the general level of spreads will come down if interest rates remain at their current levels. However, as we have discussed previously, we have been able to maintain strong spreads in this environment as a result of our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the use of derivatives. 
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in our Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segment, particularly in the nonmedical health and property/casualty businesses, as well as in Latin America. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall, expense ratio was 25.2% on a reported basis in the quarter and 24.2% when adjusting for pension and post-retirement benefits. While the new DAC accounting rules elevate the expense ratio, our underlying discipline around expenses remains very much intact. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some highlights. First, let me discuss some onetime items which occurred during the first quarter. As a result of a multistate examination and settlement payment related to unclaimed property and MetLife's use of the Social Security Death Master File, retail life incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders while our Corporate & Other segment incurred a $26 million after tax or $0.02 per share charge related to the examination payment. This was partially offset by the following favorable onetime items in the quarter, which impacted operating earnings by $22 million after tax or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were favorably impacted by $12 million after tax due to an accident and health reserve release in Japan. Our property and casualty business had a favorable prior year development reserve release in its auto business of $4 million after tax and incurred catastrophe losses of $17 million after tax, which was $3 million below our first quarter plan provision of $20 million after tax. And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had a few additional onetime items that benefited earnings by a net $3 million after tax. 
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by region. In the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.2 billion for the first quarter, up 13% versus the prior year quarter of $1 billion. The primary business drivers for this earnings growth were in retail annuities, property and casualty and Latin America. 
Retail annuities operating earnings were $282 million, up 37% year-over-year, as the business experienced favorable market performance and strong investment spreads. As a result of the S&P 500 being up almost 12% in the quarter, retail annuities had an initial market impact on operating earnings of $38 million after tax due to favorable DAC and SOP 03-1 true-ups. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, achieved a record of 309 basis points in the quarter, driven by core earned rates from higher fixed income yields, higher derivative income and lower credit rates. 
Property/casualty operating earnings were $91 million, up 60% year-over-year, as a result of favorable non-cat accident year experienced and favorable catastrophe losses, primarily in our homeowner's line. The combined ratio for property and casualty was 91.7% and 88.2% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This was significantly below the combined ratio of 98.7% and 92.5% excluding cats in the first quarter of 2011 and well below plan. While we are pleased with these results, it should be pointed out that catastrophes are seasonal, and we plan for higher cats in the second and third quarters. 
Latin America operating earnings were $148 million, up 22% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 30% due to growth across the region and improved underwriting results. We expect Latin America's results to remain strong for the balance of the year. 
In addition, the nonmedical health total benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.7%, 100 basis point improvement versus 87.7% in the first quarter of 2011. Results in dental were solid, reflecting favorable trend and utilization. And disability results were encouraging as the LTD incidence rate improved versus the prior year quarter and actually came in better than expected. However, I should point out recoveries continue to be weak. 
Mortality results for the Americas were mixed in the quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 89.1%, higher than the prior year quarter of 88.2% and a very strong fourth quarter of 85.2%. That said, the ratio was within our expectations. Retail life mortality ratio was 91.6% in the quarter, better than the prior year quarter of 92.5% but higher than a very favorable fourth quarter of 81.1%. Overall, retail life underwriting results were below plan but we would expect them to return to more normal levels. 
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.3 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher separate account fees and income annuity premiums in retail annuities, higher closeouts and structured settlement sales in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and growth in immediate annuity sales in Chile and universal life and AFORE sales in Mexico, which are all in our Latin America segment. 
Let me turn to our Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $297 million, up 33% from $224 million in the prior year quarter, due to strong growth in the business, particularly in Japan, as well as improved expense efficiency. In Japan, operating earnings growth was driven by favorable results in accident and health and ordinary life, as well as improved expense efficiency. 
Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 8% from $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenue grew 3% due to business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia, as well as favorable persistency in both Japan and Korea. Japan premiums, fees and other revenues were up 10% year-over-year, 3% on a constant rate basis. 
In addition, total sales for the region grew 15%, driven by increases in Japan, China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and annuity sales in Japan, accident and health sales in Korea and China and group sales in Australia. 
Turning to EMEA. In EMEA, first quarter results were solid and in line with expectations despite the challenging market conditions across the region. Operating earnings were $76 million, down 4% from the first quarter of 2011, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus key European currencies and the challenging economic environment. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 2%, reflecting growth in emerging markets within the region. EMEA sales grew 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011 driven by our new distribution partner in Turkey and strong credit life sales. 
Premiums, fees and other revenues increased 9% from the first quarter of 2011. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 14%, driven by strong persistency and growth in emerging markets. Immediate annuities in Western Europe were also a driver. However, we are evaluating the product in light of the competitive environment there, which may dampen the run rate going forward. 
Now let's turn to investments. Let me begin with variable investment income, which, as a reminder, now excludes securities lending. Pretax variable investment income was $239 million and within our 2012 quarterly guidance range of $150 million to $250 million. After taxes, variable investment income was $155 million. Barring any unforeseen market disruptions, we expect variable income to remain within our 2012 guidance range. 
Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the first quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses of $145 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $103 million after tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year and within the full year range established on our Investor Day call. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of March 31, our valuation allowance is $368 million, down from $398 million at December 31. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 60% from 61%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of March 31, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $40 billion portfolio. 
With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax losses of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by the impact of MetLife's credit spreads and higher interest rates. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Lastly, I would like to update you on certain European exposures. As of quarter end, the GAAP book value of our peripheral European sovereign debt was $210 million. In the second quarter of 2012 (sic), we did participate in the Greek debt exchange, and as a result of the exchange, our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt has been further reduced to approximately $100 million, which is a very modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. With respect to European banks, we continue to selectively trim our positions during the quarter, and we believe our remaining exposure is very manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio. 
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, is at $46.52 as of March 31, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 10%. That said, I should point out that our ending 2011 book value, excluding AOCI, was reduced by $2.5 billion or $2.34 per share as a result of the new DAC accounting rules. When adjusting for other equity impacts, the total reduction was $2.3 billion, which was within the range of our guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion provided on our December 5 call. In addition, after-tax derivative losses of $1.3 billion that I mentioned previously reduced book value by another $1.26 per share. 
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter of 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The solid results were primarily driven by favorable underwriting and improved market conditions in the quarter. 
As Steve mentioned, our combined RBC ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies, excluding Alico, at year end 2011 was 450%. Also, our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 880%. Our results clearly reflect a strong capital position in the U.S. and Japan. 
Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at March 31 were approximately $4.4 billion, giving us deployable capital of roughly $3.4 billion above a $1 billion holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital remains within the guidance range of $6 billion to $7 billion at year end 2012 prior to any capital management actions. 
In conclusion, MetLife had a very good first quarter. Our margins remain strong, as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth, and our financial strength is intact, as reflected in our capital position which remains robust. 
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions."

And in particular, how are you looking at that as part of your strategic review? And then just a question on the earnings side. I guess the U.S. earnings came in well above plan. How should we think about that as it relates to a run rate? It looks like to me it was a mix of strong investment spreads and good underwriting results. What's your anticipation as to whether or not that's going to be sustained for the balance of the year?"

Having said that, we've lived most of our existence at MetLife under state regulatory regimes, which have one set of rules for us. We now, as you know, as a bank holding company are regulated additionally by the Fed, and there are different rules as a bank holding company, which we've talked about with respect to the Fed stress test we just went through. So that's why my remarks were cautious, in a sense of measuring all this, trying to take into account this changing regulatory landscape that we currently face. We are de-banking. There's still the issue of whether MetLife and other insurers, large insurers, may be designated by FSOC as a nonbank SIFI. So all those factors are taken into consideration as we think about when and how to return capital to shareholders. And as that landscape becomes clear to us and as we get through the bank -- de-banking process, then we'll have more to say about that. So those things are still a moving target. To date, no one's been designated yet in nonbank SIFIs. So we have to wait and see more on that. If you are designated as such, the rules are, at this point, not promulgated. So it is -- it's a difficult environment in which to operate from the point of view of providing clarity and certainty to our shareholders this very moment about our capital plans. As to U.S. earnings, I’ll simply say we had a very good Q1. Eric went through some of the details in that in terms of what drove those good earnings. As mentioned, we're not changing our guidance. Obviously, the strong first quarter puts upward pressure within the range that we provided to you at Investor Day. And beyond that, I'll simply say that we're heartened by the first quarter but it is uncertain environment out there in the world today and we're remaining with the current guidance. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?"

Just thinking about a few things that we don't normalize as we consider them part of our business frankly. We did have about $0.04 of initial market impact that helped earnings in the Americas in the first quarter. We’ve talked about the fact that our variable investment income was at the higher end of our range. Our range is $150 million to $250 million, and we came in at $239 million. So you can think about that. In addition, on a normalized basis, we reported P&C earnings of $84 million. And as I mentioned, we expect higher cats in the second quarter and third quarter. And as a matter of fact, versus last year, we actually added another $20 million to our cat provision for the second quarter. So I think P&C earnings will come down a little bit in the second quarter. And finally, we had very good recurring income. We expect that to -- for the most degree, to continue going forward. But it was a very good quarter. So when I say recurring income, investment income, I mean non-variable.

I mean, 2011 was a bit of an aberration because of the way we priced the new product. So it's all relevant in terms of what you mean pulling back. Obviously, we've seen people in the industry exit this business, and a lot of that has to do with, frankly, their historical risk management performance. And they just couldn't stand the pain anymore. Our experience is very different and we've talked about on many different occasions about how we hedge this product and how we've come through the financial crisis. So we're -- we think we're in much better shape, and we think the product we sell today has a very good return. So hedging costs are still a little elevated relative to our pricing assumptions, but just a little bit, frankly, and that does jump around. So I guess that's kind of our feeling about that."

We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI rose to $48.60, a 12% gain year-over-year. MetLife's story in the second quarter is one of sound execution on the fundamentals. Our underwriting results remain solid, with strong performance in dental and improving results in disability. MetLife's commitment to underwriting discipline demonstrates that we will not chase sales at the expense of margins, which has proved over time to be a competitive strength. Consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and risk, we have reduced verbal annuity sales in the quarter by 34% year-over-year and by 6% sequentially.
Emerging market growth and others, strategic priorities was very strong in Latin America, with earnings up 5% in reported basis and by 19% on a constant currency basis. Perhaps no area better reflects the disciplined approach we take to the business than our actions to manage interest rate exposure. As you know, we provided the extensive disclosure about our interest rate risk in conjunction with the third quarter 2011 earnings call. Interest rates have come down further since then. And we have done additional analysis on the impact to MetLife's earnings. I would like to share those results with you today. 
The interest rate scenario we discussed last fall assumed the rate curve with a 10-year Treasury rate held flat at 2% for 5 years. We reran that's scenario using a more recent yield curve, with a 10-year Treasury at a record low, 1.4%. The result was essentially no incremental impact on MetLife's earnings per share for 2012 and 2013, and only roughly $0.05 per share in 2014.
We also examined the impact of the low interest rate environment on MetLife's return equity. At our Investor Day in May, we said we expected to have an ROE of 12% to 14% by 2016. Even if a 10-year Treasury rate will remain at 1.4% to the end of 2016, we would expect to hit the lower end of that range, adding roughly 100 basis points of ROE from this year's expected level despite the low interest rate environment. The impact of low interest rates on MetLife's earnings is more benign than many suspect for 2 main reasons. First, we still have room to adjust credit rates on a number of our products in response to changes in interest rates. And second, our hedging program has been highly effective. We made a forward-looking call in 2004 to start buying low rate protection with the 10-year Treasury was trading above 4%. We are reaping the benefits today, and we will continue to do so for a number of years to come.
Now let me discuss a few regulatory issues facing MetLife. With regard to debanking, regulatory approval for the sale of the depository business of MetLife bank to GE Capital needs to be obtained from the FDIC. And the application for sale is pending with them. I know that investors are eager for resolution of this issue, but the timing is outside of MetLife's control. As I said last quarter, I'm not going to speculate as to when the FDIC will take final action. As soon as we have something to report, we will. Until then, we are not responding to questions about the status of the FDIC process. 
Looking ahead, a central regulatory issue for MetLife is whether we'll be named a nonbank systemically important financial institution. And what the new Prudential standards for nonbank [indiscernible] will look like. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has begun designating nonbank [indiscernible]. On July 18, at [indiscernible] designation to 8 financial clearinghouses. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. In the event that certain insurance companies are named Sufis, the impact is a matter of public debate. With some policy analysts focusing on the benefits and others focusing on the cost. My view is that the impact will depend on how the final Prudential rules are written. 
So far, Federal Reserve officials have signaled of their intention to adapt the rules to the unique circumstances of nonbank financial firms. In recent congressional testimony, Fed officials have said that bank-centric capital rules would likely be a bad fit for insurance companies. There is a recognition that insurance companies have different asset and liability structures than banks. And that the appropriate regulation needs to take that into account.
Now let me provide an update on recent M&A activity. As I've said previously, we take a portfolio view of our business. Investing markets we consider core and divesting from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Earlier this week, we close on the sale of a significant portion of our Caribbean and Central American operations to Pan American Life Insurance group, which was initially announced last November. Also this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aviva plc's Life Insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, which expands MetLife's presence and growth markets in Eastern Europe. 
Our views on M&A remained consistent. Any transaction we pursue must compare favorably to alternative uses of capital. Before I hand the call over to Eric, I also want to take a moment to highlight the completion of the senior Executive team here at MetLife. Yesterday, Chris [indiscernible] started as our President for Asia based in Hong Kong. Chris comes to us from Chartis where he served as CEO of their Asia Pacific region with 4,700 employees in 15 countries. Chris has a strong background in the area of capital management and portfolio optimization, as well as a Direct-to-Consumer business, which is an important part of our Asia operation.
And right after Labor Day, John Hill will be starting as MetLife's new CFO. John is a highly-qualified Chief Financial Officer with over 30 years of broad experience in the financial services industry. He comes to us from Arch Capital group where he was Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer of ING Groep, one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Earlier in his career, John spent 11 years with Merrill Lynch in Investment Bank, marketing official positions. 
Finally, I want to thank Eric Steigerwalt who has done an excellent job as Interim CFO. Upon the arrival of John Hill, Eric will devote himself full-time to leading our retail business and reporting to Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas division. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric."

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.33 per share for the second quarter.

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.33 per share for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, the benefited operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, our strong results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our businesses and our focus on pricing, underwriting and expense discipline across all of our regions. Interest margins were favorable due to strong variable investment income, which was significantly above our planned range and higher recurring net investment income. As we have stated in prior calls, we have been able to maintain strong spreads despite this lower rate environment due to our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In addition, we continue to manage crediting rates prudently and have additional capacity to lower rates on our interest rate sensitive products.
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in Non-Medical Health and had significant improvement in property/casualty, as compared to the record catastrophes in the prior-year quarter. We also had solid results in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 24.1% on a reported basis in the quarter and 23.2% when adjusting for pension and postretirement benefits. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some significant items included in the second quarter results. Pretax variable investment income was $371 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $242 million or $0.07 per share above the top of our 2012 guidance range. This performance was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. I should remind you that we report our private equity funds on a 1 quarter lag, therefore, we'd expect that returns in our private equity portfolio in the third quarter will be impacted by market performance in the second quarter.
In the Americas, our property and casualty business incurred catastrophe losses of $94 million after-tax, which was $44 million after-tax or $0.04 per share above our second quarter plan provision of $50 million after-tax. These higher-than-expected catastrophes were partially offset by a favorable non-cat prior-year development reserve release, primarily in our auto business of $25 million after-tax or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $17 million or $0.02 per share due to a DAC model refinement in Japan. 
In our EMEA region, operating earnings benefited from a $12 million after-tax or $0.01 per share release of negative [indiscernible] in Greece, as customers have shifted away from interest sensitive pension products to products with more liquidity.
And finally, our Corporate and Other segment had 2 individual items, which each negatively impacted earnings by a little over $0.01 per share. These items relate to expenses from our efficiency initiatives and our Japan JV run of book of business. 
Now let's take a look of the results in the quarter by region. For the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this earnings growth were in our Retail and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segments. The Retail segment reported operating earnings of $380 million for the second quarter, up 14% as compared to the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by the annuity segment. Operating earnings for annuities were $226 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year as the business continues to enjoy strong core spreads, higher fee income due to the separate account asset growth and lower expenses, partially offset by market troughs in the quarter. Deferred annuity spreads as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, were 301 basis points in the quarter, down modestly from the record spreads in the first quarter but up 44 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to higher derivative income, primarily from interest rate floors, as well as lower crediting rates.
Our Group, Voluntary and Worksite segment reported operating earnings of $295 million for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior quarter, driven by the Non-Medical Health and property/casualty businesses. Non-Medical Health reported operating earnings of $133 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, mainly on improved underwriting earnings across the product set. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, a 140 basis point improvement in the ratios compared to the prior year quarter of 87.5% and well within our expectations.
In dental, our underwriting trends remain favorable as a result of stable utilization, combined with our disciplined pricing strategy. Also, disability results improved due to a lower LTD incidence rate compared to the prior-year quarter and plan. However, recoveries, while better than the prior year, continued to remain below plan in the second quarter. 
Property and casualty operating earnings were $44 million in the quarter, up $100 million versus the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophes as compared to the record prior year levels. That said, pretax catastrophe losses of $144 million were above our plan. The combined ratio for property and casualty was 102.3% or 83.4%, excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This result was significantly better than the combined ratio of 121.7% or 85.9%, excluding cats in the second quarter of 2011.
Latin America operating earnings were $135 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 19% due to business growth across the region, operating synergies and higher investment yields. Also, underwriting results were favorable to plan, primarily in Mexico. We expect underwriting in Latin America to continue to be favorable for the balance of the year.
Mortality results in the U.S. were modestly unfavorable in the quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. Group lives loss ratio for the quarter was 87.3%, higher than the very strong prior-year quarter of 82.1% but right within our expectations. Retail life mortality ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, higher than the prior-year quarter of 84.4%. However, reinsurance recoveries were better in the quarter, resulting in an improvement of overall underwriting results year-over-year.
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year quarter. Higher separate account fees and retail annuities, solid dental premiums in Non-Medical Health were offset by lower pension closeouts. In Non-Medical Health, results this quarter reflect nearly $100 million of premiums from the TRICARE dental contract, which became effective May 1. Also, in Latin America, while revenues were up 1% year-over-year, they were up 13% on a constant rate basis, driven by growth in accident and health and strong immediate annuity sales. 
Now let me turn to the Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $275 million, up 61% from $171 million in the prior-year quarter and up 25% after adjusting for onetime items, most notably, $44 million of higher claims and expenses in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We are seeing solid growth in new business in Japan, as well as strong persistency gains year-over-year, particularly for accident and health products. Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant rate basis. Growth was driven by new business in Japan and persistency gains in both Japan and Korea. In addition, total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by Japan, which was up 33% year-over-year, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and accident and health sales in Japan and A&H sales in China, as well as group sales in Australia.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $82 million, up 28% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 46% on a constant rate basis. This increase was due to expense improvements, business growth in several countries and the benefit of a onetime item in the quarter that I discussed earlier. EMEA premiums, fees and other revenues were $815 million, down 4% versus the prior-year quarter on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant rate basis. Finally, EMEA sales grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven by Turkey, credit life sales in Russia and strong sales in our Gulf countries. This is a solid result despite the challenging market conditions across the region.
Now let me turn to investments. Let's start with our realized investment gains and losses. In the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $4 million. Included in this net gain were impairments of $36 million after-tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of June 30, our valuation allowance was $300 million, down from $368 million at the end of the first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 59% from 60% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of June 30, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $41 billion portfolio.
Finally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Now let me discuss the balance sheet and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at June 30 totaled approximately $5.3 billion, which is on track with our 2012 guidance. This includes a $1.5 billion residual capital remittance from our Japan operation in May as it converted from a branch to a subsidiary, offset by the deployment of $397 million as we repaid senior debt that matured in June. Our Japan Solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 847% as of March 31, 2012 and well above our target ratio of 600%. Due to accounting rules, this included the effect of the plan residual capital remittance, which was largely offset by a surplus relief transaction that occurred in the first quarter.
Next, I would like to provide you with an updated on our U.S. stack earnings and capital position. Our preliminary second quarter 2012 statutory operating earnings and net income for our domestic insurance companies were approximately $230 million and $630 million, respectively. The results were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go through the income statement but instead are reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital or DAC increased by $2.1 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets and now stands at approximately $30 billion as of June 30.
For the first 6 months of 2012, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. 
In conclusion, MetLife had another very good quarter. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth through pricing, underwriting expense and investment discipline. As a result, we have been able to grow earnings, maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position in a very challenging environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions."

And I think the other thing too, obviously, is that our underwriting discipline over the last couple of years by contrast is pretty start with some of our peers. So I think that's good. In terms of interest rates and how that might be influencing pricing, we've seen yet another kind of dip here in interest rates from the 10-year Treasuries sort of the 2-ish range down to 1.5. I think that I'm not sure everybody's caught up yet with that reality in terms of their pricing. And so I would guess you're going to see of pricing adjustment coming from the industry because of it. I think when interstates get [indiscernible] obviously, that really starts to pressure ROI, product sales. But it takes a little bit of time, I think, for pricing to adjust, and I'm sure some people probably think that GL rate and I'm sure will get better, how could it possibly get lower, but I think people have been making -- saying that line for quite a while and it's not come true. So we view this as an opportunity, obviously, to change prices if we need to in certain areas and we've been pretty -- pricing pretty aggressively in places like UL and obviously, the Variable Annuity business for quite some time now. And that's having an affect in our sales levels of there, but I think I think that makes good sense to do."

If they use more of a bank framework with a modification, they want to see the details to determine whether or not the thing that is an appropriate way to regulate a company like ours. They have made statements on record in Washington at the senior levels at the Fed, the Treasury, that purely banking model would not make sense in terms of regulating the insurance industries.

So let me just review the bidding on what we did previously. We said that in the last interest-rate presentation that Steve referred to, that we would have no staff reserve strengthening but that we expected to have modest actions year after year after year. We said there'd be no GAAP recognition in the U.S. We said we'd probably have, let's call it, $400 million to $450 million after-tax impact on DAC, mostly occurring in the back end of that 5-year outlook. And we said there's potential pressure on Retirement Products goodwill. So at this point, and I'm just going to make a blanket statement here, anything I say here is going to be subject to what we learn in actual testing, okay, which is just beginning, both for CFD, loss recognition, goodwill testing, et cetera, okay? So having said that, I think maybe the change here would be, I feel compelled to say that modest staff reserves strengthening could be required if rates stay low. For the GAAP loss recognition, as we think about it from the point of view of August 1 here, August 2, whenever date this is, we don't see a lot of loss recognition in the near term. But again, we'll have to see what happens as we go through testing. We still don't see given our current methodology, a big DAC impact in the next couple of years. And I would certainly finally add that the remains pressure on our goodwill, specifically for the Retirement Products. We're starting goodwill testing now, and we'll have to see where we come out as we get to the end of the year here. So I'm increasing it, using the word modest, but always subject to what we learn as we go through all the various tests."

The General Motors transaction, I think it's fair to view that as a bit of a catalyst. I think that's causing other corporate treasurers of large traditional companies with all traditional pension plans to think hard about what they should be doing. And certainly there's a lot more conversation now than there was pre-GM. I might -- but, of course, is interest-rate keep ticking down and I think that makes pension closeout more difficult. So there's contrary trend influences there. But I do think you'll see more deals, more big deals despite the low interest rate. In terms of how we're approaching it, each, a big pension closeout is a big sort of one-off transaction. It's not unfair to think of it like a big M&A deal. It's a large transfer of assets. So the capital considerations there are significant. And so we, just like an M&A deal or anything else, which is a big capital transaction, have to evaluate that capital that would get allocated that deal versus other alternatives that are available to the company. We will not do a big closeout just so we can print a big deal, okay? If it doesn't add shareholder value and get us the right kind of returns in our capital, we will not do it. And so that's got to be our discipline. And look, I think our track record about having being discipline about those kind of decisions is pretty good. So that's how we got to look at it."

And see, if you kind of impute a cost of capital to MetLife's equity right now, it's higher than 12% number that Bill just referred to.

And we have to really look at this at a longer time frame because basically, right now, the markets are very volatile probably driven by things like low rates, obviously, for industry, regulatory overhang for larger insurers and so on. And that's driven up the perception of the marketplace about what our beta is. And it certainly now, and closer to a 2 beta as opposed to historical norm closer to 1 or 1.1. So as we think about our business, I wouldn't, for example, in the flipside say if our beta drops just hypothetically to below 1, let's say 0.6 or something, that all of a sudden we're going to print a bunch of business at 8%, we wouldn't think that would be the prudent thing to do longer-term. Similarly, things are spiking up because of near-term volatility out there. We have to kind to look past that at a short timeframe.

And now that we've done a refresh of this, I think it kind of confirms what we thought previously and now just simply adds to that. Now we've got a couple of things going on here. We always thought when we made that presentation last year that we would -- that we not only had room in crediting rates, but that we would take advantage of that, if rates continue to decline, that's number one. In some of our portfolios, I think we're probably better cash flow matched than anybody externally would actually think. Third, we've got a lot of interest rate protection. We've got all these floors and swaptions and swaps that we've talked about. Floor income year-over-year is meaningful and could continue to be meaningful depending, if rates stay here or, frankly, even if they went a little bit lower. I guess I'll give you a sense because I've know we've talked about this publicly. Like in our UL I'll block, 1/3 of that block is that minimum guarantees. So here where we are today, end of the second quarter, 1/3 of the block is minimum guarantees. I don't know what to have thought that number was but that means, obviously, we've got 2/3 to go.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the Other Financial Information section.
A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Bill Hogan, Executive Vice President and Head of our Japan operations.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve."

MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value",1115,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, rose to $48.60, a 12% gain year-over-year. 
MetLife's story in the second quarter is one of sound execution on the fundamentals. Our underwriting results remain solid with strong performance in dental and improving results in disability. MetLife's commitment to underwriting discipline demonstrates that we will not chase sales at the expense of margins, which has proved over time to be a competitive strength. Consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and risk, we have reduced variable annuity sales in the quarter by 34% year-over-year and by 6% sequentially.
Emerging market growth,,another strategic priority, was very strong in Latin America with earnings up 5% in reported basis and by 19% on a constant currency basis. Perhaps no area better reflects the disciplined approach we take to the business than our actions to manage interest rate exposure. As you know, we provided the extensive disclosure about our interest rate risk in conjunction with the third quarter 2011 earnings call. Interest rates have come down further since then. And we have done additional analysis on the impact to MetLife's earnings. I would like to share those results with you today. 
The interest rate scenario we discussed last fall assumed a rate curve with a 10-year Treasury rate held flat at 2% for 5 years. We reran that's scenario using a more recent yield curve with a 10-year Treasury at a record low 1.4%. The result was essentially no incremental impact on MetLife's earning per share for 2012 and 2013 and only roughly $0.05 per share in 2014.
We also examined the impact of the low interest rate environment on MetLife's return equity. At our Investor Day in May, we said we expected to have an ROE of 12% to 14% by 2016. Even if the 10-year Treasury rate will remain at 1.4% till the end of 2016, we would expect to hit the lower end of that range, adding roughly 100 basis points of ROE from this year's expected level despite the low interest rate environment. The impact of low interest rates on MetLife's earnings is more benign than many suspect for 2 main reasons. First, we still have room to adjust credit rates on a number of our products in response to changes in interest rates. And second, our hedging program has been highly effective. We made a forward-looking call in 2004 to start buying low rate protection when the 10-year Treasury was trading above 4%. We are reaping the benefits today, and we will continue to do so for a number of years to come.
Now let me discuss a few regulatory issues facing MetLife. With regard to debanking, regulatory approval for the sale of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital needs to be obtained from the FDIC. And the application for sale is pending with them. I know that investors are eager for resolution of this issue, but the timing is outside of MetLife's control. As I said last quarter, I'm not going to speculate as to when the FDIC will take final action. As soon as we have something to report, we will. Until then, we are not responding to questions about the status of the FDIC process. 
Looking ahead, a central regulatory issue for MetLife is whether we'll be named a nonbank systemically important financial institution and what the new prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs will look like. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has begun designating nonbank SIFIs. On July 18, FSOC applied the designation to 8 financial clearinghouses. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. In the event that certain insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact is a matter of public debate with some policy analysts focusing on the benefits and others focusing on the costs. My view is that the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. 
So far, Federal Reserve officials have signaled their intention to adapt the rules to the unique circumstances of nonbank financial firms. In recent congressional testimony, Fed officials have said the bank-centric capital rules would likely be a bad fit for insurance companies. There is a recognition that insurance companies have different asset and liability structures than banks and that the appropriate regulation needs to take that into account.
Now let me provide an update on recent M&A activity. As I've said previously, we take a portfolio view of our business, investing markets we consider core and divesting from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Earlier this week, we closed on the sale of a significant portion of our Caribbean and Central American operations to Pan-American Life Insurance Group, which was initially announced last November. Also this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aviva plc's life insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, which expands MetLife's presence and growth markets in Eastern Europe. Our views on M&A remain consistent. Any transaction we pursue must compare favorably to alternative uses of capital. 
Before I hand the call over to Eric, I also want to take a moment to highlight the completion of the senior executive team here at MetLife. Yesterday, Chris Townsend started as our President for Asia based in Hong Kong. Chris comes to us from Chartis, where he served as CEO of their Asia Pacific region with 4,700 employees in 15 countries. Chris has a strong background in the area of capital management and portfolio optimization, as well as the direct-to-consumer business, which is an important part of our Asia operations.
And right after Labor Day, John Hele will be starting as MetLife's new CFO. John is a highly qualified Chief Financial Officer with over 30 years of broad experience in the financial services industry. He comes to us from Arch Capital Group, where he was Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer of ING Group, one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Earlier in his career, John spent 11 years with Merrill Lynch in investment banking, marketing and financial positions. 
Finally, I want to thank Eric Steigerwalt who has done an excellent job as Interim CFO. Upon the arrival of John Hele, Eric will devote himself full time to leading our Retail business and reporting to Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas division. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric."

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, that benefited operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, our strong results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our businesses and our focus on pricing, underwriting and expense discipline across all of our regions. Interest margins were favorable due to strong variable investment income, which was significantly above our planned range and higher recurring net investment income. As we have stated in prior calls, we have been able to maintain strong spreads despite this low rate environment due to our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In addition, we continue to manage crediting rates prudently and have additional capacity to lower rates on our interest-rate-sensitive products.
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in Non-Medical Health and had significant improvement in property/casualty as compared to the record catastrophes in the prior year quarter. We also had solid results in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 24.1% on a reported basis in the quarter and 23.2% when adjusting for pension and postretirement benefits. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some significant items included in the second quarter results. Pretax variable investment income was $371 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $242 million, or $0.07 per share, above the top of our 2012 guidance range. This performance was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. I should remind you that we report our private equity funds on a one-quarter lag, therefore, we would expect that returns in our private equity portfolio in the third quarter will be impacted by market performance in the second quarter.
In the Americas, our property & casualty business incurred catastrophe losses of $94 million after tax, which was $44 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, above our second quarter plan provision of $50 million after tax. These higher-than-expected catastrophes were partially offset by a favorable non-cat prior year development reserve release, primarily in our auto business, of $25 million after tax, or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $17 million, or $0.02 per share, due to a DAC model refinement in Japan. 
In our EMEA region, operating earnings benefited from a $12 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share, release of negative VOBA in Greece as customers have shifted away from interest-sensitive pension products to products with more liquidity.
And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had 2 individual items, which each negatively impacted earnings by a little over $0.01 per share. These items relate to expenses from our efficiency initiative and our Japan JV run-off book of business. 
Now let's take a look of the results in the quarter by region. For the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this earnings growth were in our Retail and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segments. The Retail segment reported operating earnings of $380 million for the second quarter, up 14% as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the annuity segment. Operating earnings for annuities were $226 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year as the business continues to enjoy strong core spreads, higher fee income due to the separate account asset growth and lower expenses, partially offset by market troughs in the quarter. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, were 301 basis points in the quarter, down modestly from the record spreads in the first quarter but up 44 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to higher derivative income, primarily from interest rate floors, as well as lower crediting rates.
Our Group, Voluntary and Worksite segment reported operating earnings of $295 million for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior quarter, driven by the Non-Medical Health and property/casualty businesses. Non-Medical Health reported operating earnings of $133 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, mainly on improved underwriting earnings across the product set. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement in the ratios compared to the prior year quarter of 87.5% and well within our expectations.
In dental, our underwriting trends remain favorable as a result of stable utilization combined with our disciplined pricing strategy. Also, disability results improved due to a lower LTD incidence rate compared to the prior year quarter and plan. However, recoveries, while better than the prior year, continued to remain below plan in the second quarter. 
Property & casualty operating earnings were $44 million in the quarter, up $100 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophes as compared to the record prior year levels. That said, pretax catastrophe losses of $144 million were above our plan. The combined ratio for property & casualty was 102.3%, or 83.4% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This result was significantly better than the combined ratio of 121.7%, or 85.9% excluding cats in the second quarter of 2011.
Latin America operating earnings were $135 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 19% due to business growth across the region, operating synergies and higher investment yields. Also, underwriting results were favorable to plan, primarily in Mexico. We expect underwriting in Latin America to continue to be favorable for the balance of the year.
Mortality results in the U.S. were modestly unfavorable in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 87.3%, higher than the very strong prior year quarter of 82.1% but right within our expectations. Retail life's mortality ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, higher than the prior year quarter of 84.4%. However, reinsurance recoveries were better in the quarter, resulting in an improvement of overall underwriting results year-over-year.
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year quarter. Higher separate account fees and retail annuities, solid dental premiums in Non-Medical Health were offset by lower pension closeouts. In Non-Medical Health, results this quarter reflect nearly $100 million of premiums from the TRICARE Dental contract, which became effective May 1. Also, in Latin America, while revenues were up 1% year-over-year, they were up 13% on a constant rate basis, driven by growth in accident and health and strong immediate annuity sales. 
Now let me turn to the Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $275 million, up 61% from $171 million in the prior year quarter and up 25% after adjusting for onetime items, most notably $44 million of higher claims and expenses in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We are seeing solid growth in new business in Japan, as well as strong persistency gains year-over-year, particularly for accident and health products. Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant rate basis. Growth was driven by new business in Japan and persistency gains in both Japan and Korea. In addition, total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by Japan, which was up 33% year-over-year, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and accident and health sales in Japan and A&H sales in China, as well as group sales in Australia.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $82 million, up 28% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 46% on a constant rate basis. This increase was due to expense improvements, business growth in several countries and the benefit of a onetime item in the quarter that I discussed earlier. EMEA premiums, fees and other revenues were $815 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant rate basis. Finally, EMEA sales grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven by Turkey, credit life sales in Russia and strong sales in our Gulf countries. This is a solid result despite the challenging market conditions across the region.
Now let me turn to investments. Let's start with our realized investment gains and losses. In the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $4 million. Included in this net gain were impairments of $36 million after-tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of June 30, our valuation allowance was $300 million, down from $368 million at the end of the first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 59% from 60% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of June 30, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $41 billion portfolio.
Finally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Now let me discuss the balance sheet and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at June 30 totaled approximately $5.3 billion, which is on track with our 2012 guidance. This includes a $1.5 billion residual capital remittance from our Japan operation in May as it converted from a branch to a subsidiary, offset by the deployment of $397 million as we repaid senior debt that matured in June. Our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 847% as of March 31, 2012, and well above our target ratio of 600%. Due to accounting rules, this included the effect of the plan residual capital remittance, which was largely offset by a surplus relief transaction that occurred in the first quarter.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our U.S. stat earnings and capital position. Our preliminary second quarter 2012 statutory operating earnings and net income for our domestic insurance companies were approximately $230 million and $630 million, respectively. The results were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go through the income statement but instead are reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital, or TAC, increased by $2.1 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets, and now stands at approximately $30 billion as of June 30. For the first 6 months of 2012, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. 
In conclusion, MetLife had another very good quarter. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth through pricing, underwriting, expense and investment discipline. As a result, we have been able to grow earnings, maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position in a very challenging environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions."

And so I think they're showing a lot more discipline now, and that's just good for us. And I think the other thing, too, obviously, is that our underwriting discipline over the last couple of years, the contrast is pretty stark with some of our peers. So I think that's good. In terms of interest rates and how that might be influencing pricing, we've seen yet another kind of dip here in interest rates from the 10-year Treasuries sort of the 2-ish range down to 1.5. I think that I'm not sure everybody's caught up yet with that reality in terms of their pricing. And so I would guess you're going to see more pricing adjustments coming from the industry because of it. I think when interest rates get this low, obviously, that really starts to pressure ROIs, product sales. But it takes a little bit of time, I think, for pricing to adjust. And I'm sure some people probably think that GL [ph] will just rate and I'm sure will get better. How could it possibly get lower? But I think people have been making -- saying that line for quite a while, and now it's not come true. So we view this as an opportunity, obviously, to change prices if we need to in certain areas. And we've been pretty -- pricing pretty aggressively in places like UL. And obviously, the variable annuity business for quite some time now.

If it is decided that insurance companies are deemed as being systemically risky, then the framework will come out of the Federal Reserve. At this point in time, we really don't have a great deal of insight as to how they will sort all that out. If they use more of a bank framework with a modification, they want to see the details to determine whether or not we think that is an appropriate way to regulate a company like ours. They have made statements on the record out of Washington at the most senior levels of the Fed, the Treasury that a purely banking model would not make sense in terms of regulating the insurance industries. So those are favorable comments from our perspective. But again, the details are going to be the key here, and those details have not been sorted out. They have not been finalized.

So let's just review the bidding on what we did previously. We said that in the last interest rate presentation that Steve referred to, that we would have no stat reserve strengthening but that we expected to have modest actions year after year after year. We said there'd be no GAAP loss recognition in the U.S. We said we'd probably have, let's call it, $400 million to $450 million after-tax impact on DAC mostly occurring in the back end of that 5-year outlook. And we said there's potential pressure on Retirement Products goodwill. So at this point, and I'm just going to make a blanket statement here, anything I say here is going to be subject to what we learn in actual testing, okay, which is beginning, both for CFT, loss recognition, goodwill testing, et cetera, okay? So having said that, I think maybe the change here would be, I feel compelled to say that, modest stat reserves strengthening could be required if rates stay low. For GAAP loss recognition, as we think about it from the point of view of August 1 here, August 2, whenever date this is, we don't see a lot of loss recognition in the near term. But again, we'll have to see what happens as we go through testing. We still don't see, given our current methodology, a big DAC impact in the next couple of years. And I would certainly then finally add that there remains pressure on our goodwill, specifically for the Retirement Products. We're starting goodwill testing now, and we'll have to see where we come out as we get to the end of the year here. So I'm increasing it, using the word modest, but always subject to what we learn as we go through all the various tests."

The General Motors transaction, I think it's fair to view that as a bit of a catalyst. I think that's causing other corporate treasurers of large traditional companies with all traditional pension plans to think hard about what they should be doing. And certainly, there's a lot more conversation now than there was pre-GM. My expectation -- but the can of that, of course, is interest rates keep taking down. And I think that makes pension closeouts more difficult. So there's contrary trend influences there. But I do think you'll see more deals, more big deals, despite the low interest rates. In terms of how we're approaching it, each -- a big pension closeout is a big sort of one-off transaction. It's not unfair to think of it like a big M&A deal. It's a large transfer of assets. So the capital considerations there are significant. And so we, just like an M&A deal or anything else, which is a big capital transaction, have to evaluate that capital that would get allocated that deal versus other alternatives that are available to the company. We will not do a big closeout just so we can print a big deal, okay? If it doesn't add shareholder value and get us the right kind of returns on our capital, we will not do it. And so that's got to be our discipline. And look, I think our track record about having being disciplined about those kind of decisions is pretty good. So that's got to be how we look at it."

And that's driven up the perception in the marketplace about what our beta is. And it certainly is now closer to a 2 beta as opposed to historical norm closer to 1 or 1.1.

And now that we've done a refresh of this, I think it kind of confirms what we thought previously and now just simply adds to that. Now we've got a couple of things going on here. We always thought when we made that presentation last year that we would -- that we not only had room in crediting rates but that we would take advantage of that if rates continue to decline. That's number one. In some of our portfolios, I think we're probably better cash flow matched than anybody externally would actually think. Third, we've got a lot of interest rate protection. We've got all of these floors and swaptions and swaps that we've talked about. Floor income year-over-year is meaningful and could continue to be meaningful depending on if rates stay here or, frankly, even if they went a little bit lower. I guess I'll give you a sense because I've know we've talked about it this publicly. Like in our UL block, 1/3 of that block is at minimum guarantees. So here where we are today, end of the second quarter, 1/3 of the block is at minimum guarantees. I don't know what you would have thought that number was, but that means, obviously, we've got 2/3 to go. It's in the 70% range on the general account annuity blocks. And so putting all of those things together, the impact from where we were to here is minimal."

MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value",1115,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, rose to $48.60, a 12% gain year-over-year. 
MetLife's story in the second quarter is one of sound execution on the fundamentals. Our underwriting results remain solid with strong performance in dental and improving results in disability. MetLife's commitment to underwriting discipline demonstrates that we will not chase sales at the expense of margins, which has proved over time to be a competitive strength. Consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and risk, we have reduced variable annuity sales in the quarter by 34% year-over-year and by 6% sequentially.
Emerging market growth,,another strategic priority, was very strong in Latin America with earnings up 5% in reported basis and by 19% on a constant currency basis. Perhaps no area better reflects the disciplined approach we take to the business than our actions to manage interest rate exposure. As you know, we provided the extensive disclosure about our interest rate risk in conjunction with the third quarter 2011 earnings call. Interest rates have come down further since then. And we have done additional analysis on the impact to MetLife's earnings. I would like to share those results with you today. 
The interest rate scenario we discussed last fall assumed a rate curve with a 10-year Treasury rate held flat at 2% for 5 years. We reran that's scenario using a more recent yield curve with a 10-year Treasury at a record low 1.4%. The result was essentially no incremental impact on MetLife's earning per share for 2012 and 2013 and only roughly $0.05 per share in 2014.
We also examined the impact of the low interest rate environment on MetLife's return equity. At our Investor Day in May, we said we expected to have an ROE of 12% to 14% by 2016. Even if the 10-year Treasury rate will remain at 1.4% till the end of 2016, we would expect to hit the lower end of that range, adding roughly 100 basis points of ROE from this year's expected level despite the low interest rate environment. The impact of low interest rates on MetLife's earnings is more benign than many suspect for 2 main reasons. First, we still have room to adjust credit rates on a number of our products in response to changes in interest rates. And second, our hedging program has been highly effective. We made a forward-looking call in 2004 to start buying low rate protection when the 10-year Treasury was trading above 4%. We are reaping the benefits today, and we will continue to do so for a number of years to come.
Now let me discuss a few regulatory issues facing MetLife. With regard to debanking, regulatory approval for the sale of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital needs to be obtained from the FDIC. And the application for sale is pending with them. I know that investors are eager for resolution of this issue, but the timing is outside of MetLife's control. As I said last quarter, I'm not going to speculate as to when the FDIC will take final action. As soon as we have something to report, we will. Until then, we are not responding to questions about the status of the FDIC process. 
Looking ahead, a central regulatory issue for MetLife is whether we'll be named a nonbank systemically important financial institution and what the new prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs will look like. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has begun designating nonbank SIFIs. On July 18, FSOC applied the designation to 8 financial clearinghouses. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. In the event that certain insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact is a matter of public debate with some policy analysts focusing on the benefits and others focusing on the costs. My view is that the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. 
So far, Federal Reserve officials have signaled their intention to adapt the rules to the unique circumstances of nonbank financial firms. In recent congressional testimony, Fed officials have said the bank-centric capital rules would likely be a bad fit for insurance companies. There is a recognition that insurance companies have different asset and liability structures than banks and that the appropriate regulation needs to take that into account.
Now let me provide an update on recent M&A activity. As I've said previously, we take a portfolio view of our business, investing markets we consider core and divesting from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Earlier this week, we closed on the sale of a significant portion of our Caribbean and Central American operations to Pan-American Life Insurance Group, which was initially announced last November. Also this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aviva plc's life insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, which expands MetLife's presence and growth markets in Eastern Europe. Our views on M&A remain consistent. Any transaction we pursue must compare favorably to alternative uses of capital. 
Before I hand the call over to Eric, I also want to take a moment to highlight the completion of the senior executive team here at MetLife. Yesterday, Chris Townsend started as our President for Asia based in Hong Kong. Chris comes to us from Chartis, where he served as CEO of their Asia Pacific region with 4,700 employees in 15 countries. Chris has a strong background in the area of capital management and portfolio optimization, as well as the direct-to-consumer business, which is an important part of our Asia operations.
And right after Labor Day, John Hele will be starting as MetLife's new CFO. John is a highly qualified Chief Financial Officer with over 30 years of broad experience in the financial services industry. He comes to us from Arch Capital Group, where he was Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer of ING Group, one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Earlier in his career, John spent 11 years with Merrill Lynch in investment banking, marketing and financial positions. 
Finally, I want to thank Eric Steigerwalt who has done an excellent job as Interim CFO. Upon the arrival of John Hele, Eric will devote himself full time to leading our Retail business and reporting to Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas division. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric."

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, that benefited operating ear",1930,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, that benefited operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, our strong results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our businesses and our focus on pricing, underwriting and expense discipline across all of our regions. Interest margins were favorable due to strong variable investment income, which was significantly above our planned range and higher recurring net investment income. As we have stated in prior calls, we have been able to maintain strong spreads despite this low rate environment due to our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In addition, we continue to manage crediting rates prudently and have additional capacity to lower rates on our interest-rate-sensitive products.
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in Non-Medical Health and had significant improvement in property/casualty as compared to the record catastrophes in the prior year quarter. We also had solid results in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 24.1% on a reported basis in the quarter and 23.2% when adjusting for pension and postretirement benefits. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some significant items included in the second quarter results. Pretax variable investment income was $371 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $242 million, or $0.07 per share, above the top of our 2012 guidance range. This performance was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. I should remind you that we report our private equity funds on a one-quarter lag, therefore, we would expect that returns in our private equity portfolio in the third quarter will be impacted by market performance in the second quarter.
In the Americas, our property & casualty business incurred catastrophe losses of $94 million after tax, which was $44 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, above our second quarter plan provision of $50 million after tax. These higher-than-expected catastrophes were partially offset by a favorable non-cat prior year development reserve release, primarily in our auto business, of $25 million after tax, or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $17 million, or $0.02 per share, due to a DAC model refinement in Japan. 
In our EMEA region, operating earnings benefited from a $12 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share, release of negative VOBA in Greece as customers have shifted away from interest-sensitive pension products to products with more liquidity.
And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had 2 individual items, which each negatively impacted earnings by a little over $0.01 per share. These items relate to expenses from our efficiency initiative and our Japan JV run-off book of business. 
Now let's take a look of the results in the quarter by region. For the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this earnings growth were in our Retail and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segments. The Retail segment reported operating earnings of $380 million for the second quarter, up 14% as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the annuity segment. Operating earnings for annuities were $226 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year as the business continues to enjoy strong core spreads, higher fee income due to the separate account asset growth and lower expenses, partially offset by market troughs in the quarter. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, were 301 basis points in the quarter, down modestly from the record spreads in the first quarter but up 44 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to higher derivative income, primarily from interest rate floors, as well as lower crediting rates.
Our Group, Voluntary and Worksite segment reported operating earnings of $295 million for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior quarter, driven by the Non-Medical Health and property/casualty businesses. Non-Medical Health reported operating earnings of $133 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, mainly on improved underwriting earnings across the product set. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement in the ratios compared to the prior year quarter of 87.5% and well within our expectations.
In dental, our underwriting trends remain favorable as a result of stable utilization combined with our disciplined pricing strategy. Also, disability results improved due to a lower LTD incidence rate compared to the prior year quarter and plan. However, recoveries, while better than the prior year, continued to remain below plan in the second quarter. 
Property & casualty operating earnings were $44 million in the quarter, up $100 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophes as compared to the record prior year levels. That said, pretax catastrophe losses of $144 million were above our plan. The combined ratio for property & casualty was 102.3%, or 83.4% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This result was significantly better than the combined ratio of 121.7%, or 85.9% excluding cats in the second quarter of 2011.
Latin America operating earnings were $135 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 19% due to business growth across the region, operating synergies and higher investment yields. Also, underwriting results were favorable to plan, primarily in Mexico. We expect underwriting in Latin America to continue to be favorable for the balance of the year.
Mortality results in the U.S. were modestly unfavorable in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 87.3%, higher than the very strong prior year quarter of 82.1% but right within our expectations. Retail life's mortality ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, higher than the prior year quarter of 84.4%. However, reinsurance recoveries were better in the quarter, resulting in an improvement of overall underwriting results year-over-year.
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year quarter. Higher separate account fees and retail annuities, solid dental premiums in Non-Medical Health were offset by lower pension closeouts. In Non-Medical Health, results this quarter reflect nearly $100 million of premiums from the TRICARE Dental contract, which became effective May 1. Also, in Latin America, while revenues were up 1% year-over-year, they were up 13% on a constant rate basis, driven by growth in accident and health and strong immediate annuity sales. 
Now let me turn to the Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $275 million, up 61% from $171 million in the prior year quarter and up 25% after adjusting for onetime items, most notably $44 million of higher claims and expenses in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We are seeing solid growth in new business in Japan, as well as strong persistency gains year-over-year, particularly for accident and health products. Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant rate basis. Growth was driven by new business in Japan and persistency gains in both Japan and Korea. In addition, total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by Japan, which was up 33% year-over-year, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and accident and health sales in Japan and A&H sales in China, as well as group sales in Australia.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $82 million, up 28% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 46% on a constant rate basis. This increase was due to expense improvements, business growth in several countries and the benefit of a onetime item in the quarter that I discussed earlier. EMEA premiums, fees and other revenues were $815 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant rate basis. Finally, EMEA sales grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven by Turkey, credit life sales in Russia and strong sales in our Gulf countries. This is a solid result despite the challenging market conditions across the region.
Now let me turn to investments. Let's start with our realized investment gains and losses. In the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $4 million. Included in this net gain were impairments of $36 million after-tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of June 30, our valuation allowance was $300 million, down from $368 million at the end of the first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 59% from 60% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of June 30, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $41 billion portfolio.
Finally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Now let me discuss the balance sheet and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at June 30 totaled approximately $5.3 billion, which is on track with our 2012 guidance. This includes a $1.5 billion residual capital remittance from our Japan operation in May as it converted from a branch to a subsidiary, offset by the deployment of $397 million as we repaid senior debt that matured in June. Our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 847% as of March 31, 2012, and well above our target ratio of 600%. Due to accounting rules, this included the effect of the plan residual capital remittance, which was largely offset by a surplus relief transaction that occurred in the first quarter.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our U.S. stat earnings and capital position. Our preliminary second quarter 2012 statutory operating earnings and net income for our domestic insurance companies were approximately $230 million and $630 million, respectively. The results were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go through the income statement but instead are reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital, or TAC, increased by $2.1 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets, and now stands at approximately $30 billion as of June 30. For the first 6 months of 2012, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. 
In conclusion, MetLife had another very good quarter.

And I think the other thing, too, obviously, is that our underwriting discipline over the last couple of years, the contrast is pretty stark with some of our peers. So I think that's good. In terms of interest rates and how that might be influencing pricing, we've seen yet another kind of dip here in interest rates from the 10-year Treasuries sort of the 2-ish range down to 1.5. I think that I'm not sure everybody's caught up yet with that reality in terms of their pricing. And so I would guess you're going to see more pricing adjustments coming from the industry because of it. I think when interest rates get this low, obviously, that really starts to pressure ROIs, product sales. But it takes a little bit of time, I think, for pricing to adjust. And I'm sure some people probably think that GL [ph] will just rate and I'm sure will get better. How could it possibly get lower? But I think people have been making -- saying that line for quite a while, and now it's not come true. So we view this as an opportunity, obviously, to change prices if we need to in certain areas. And we've been pretty -- pricing pretty aggressively in places like UL. And obviously, the variable annuity business for quite some time now.

At this point in time, we really don't have a great deal of insight as to how they will sort all that out. If they use more of a bank framework with a modification, they want to see the details to determine whether or not we think that is an appropriate way to regulate a company like ours. They have made statements on the record out of Washington at the most senior levels of the Fed, the Treasury that a purely banking model would not make sense in terms of regulating the insurance industries.

So let's just review the bidding on what we did previously. We said that in the last interest rate presentation that Steve referred to, that we would have no stat reserve strengthening but that we expected to have modest actions year after year after year. We said there'd be no GAAP loss recognition in the U.S. We said we'd probably have, let's call it, $400 million to $450 million after-tax impact on DAC mostly occurring in the back end of that 5-year outlook. And we said there's potential pressure on Retirement Products goodwill. So at this point, and I'm just going to make a blanket statement here, anything I say here is going to be subject to what we learn in actual testing, okay, which is beginning, both for CFT, loss recognition, goodwill testing, et cetera, okay? So having said that, I think maybe the change here would be, I feel compelled to say that, modest stat reserves strengthening could be required if rates stay low. For GAAP loss recognition, as we think about it from the point of view of August 1 here, August 2, whenever date this is, we don't see a lot of loss recognition in the near term. But again, we'll have to see what happens as we go through testing. We still don't see, given our current methodology, a big DAC impact in the next couple of years. And I would certainly then finally add that there remains pressure on our goodwill, specifically for the Retirement Products. We're starting goodwill testing now, and we'll have to see where we come out as we get to the end of the year here. So I'm increasing it, using the word modest, but always subject to what we learn as we go through all the various tests."

And I think that makes pension closeouts more difficult. So there's contrary trend influences there. But I do think you'll see more deals, more big deals, despite the low interest rates. In terms of how we're approaching it, each -- a big pension closeout is a big sort of one-off transaction. It's not unfair to think of it like a big M&A deal. It's a large transfer of assets. So the capital considerations there are significant. And so we, just like an M&A deal or anything else, which is a big capital transaction, have to evaluate that capital that would get allocated that deal versus other alternatives that are available to the company. We will not do a big closeout just so we can print a big deal, okay? If it doesn't add shareholder value and get us the right kind of returns on our capital, we will not do it.

We're not very heavy into that market, and we're certainly not trying to compete with those kinds products. Latin America, the reason Latin America is really attractive to us is it's all about an emerging middle class that are first-time purchasers of life insurance. So life insurance as a percentage of GDP is growing very nicely, and then GDP itself is growing nicely. And there are markets that are developing. Our fastest-growing segments in Latin America right now are in direct marketing, okay, which, obviously, has nothing to do with interest rates, really. It's all about the channel management and driving growth. In general, I would tell you that we really do like Latin America. Obviously, it's a big segment for us. The returns are very good. The growth rates are good. Our top line growth adjusting for currency was 13% this quarter. We have very good management teams down there. They're seasoned.

And we have to really look at this in a longer time frame because basically, right now, the markets are very volatile, probably driven by things like low rates, obviously, for our industry, regulatory overhang for larger insurers and so on. And that's driven up the perception in the marketplace about what our beta is. And it certainly is now closer to a 2 beta as opposed to historical norm closer to 1 or 1.1. So as we think about our business, I wouldn't, for example, on the flip side say if our beta drops just hypothetically to below 1, let's say 0.6 or something, that all of a sudden, we're going to print a bunch of business at 8%. We wouldn't think that would be the prudent thing to do longer term. Similarly, things are spiking up because of near-term volatility out there. We have to kind of look past that at a short timeframe. So Bill gave you the answer about how we're looking at our products right now, but clearly, our cost of capital is higher than historical because our beta is significantly higher than the historical 1.1x that we've seen."

We always thought when we made that presentation last year that we would -- that we not only had room in crediting rates but that we would take advantage of that if rates continue to decline. That's number one. In some of our portfolios, I think we're probably better cash flow matched than anybody externally would actually think. Third, we've got a lot of interest rate protection. We've got all of these floors and swaptions and swaps that we've talked about. Floor income year-over-year is meaningful and could continue to be meaningful depending on if rates stay here or, frankly, even if they went a little bit lower. I guess I'll give you a sense because I've know we've talked about it this publicly. Like in our UL block, 1/3 of that block is at minimum guarantees. So here where we are today, end of the second quarter, 1/3 of the block is at minimum guarantees. I don't know what you would have thought that number was, but that means, obviously, we've got 2/3 to go. It's in the 70% range on the general account annuity blocks.

MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value",1119,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, rose to $48.60, a 12% gain year-over-year. 
MetLife's story in the second quarter is one of sound execution on the fundamentals. Our underwriting results remain solid with strong performance in dental and improving results in disability. MetLife's commitment to underwriting discipline demonstrates that we will not chase sales at the expense of margins, which has proved over time to be a competitive strength. Consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and risk, we have reduced variable annuity sales in the quarter by 34% year-over-year and by 6% sequentially.
Emerging market growth, another strategic priority, was very strong in Latin America with earnings up 5% on a reported basis and by 19% on a constant currency basis. Perhaps no area better reflects the disciplined approach we take to the business than our actions to manage interest rate exposure. As you know, we provided extensive disclosure about our interest rate risk in conjunction with the third quarter 2011 earnings call. Interest rates have come down further since then. And we have done additional analysis on the impact to MetLife's earnings. I would like to share those results with you today. 
The interest rate scenario we discussed last fall assumed a rate curve with a 10-year Treasury rate held flat at 2% for 5 years. We reran that scenario using a more recent yield curve with a 10-year Treasury at a record low 1.4%. The result was essentially no incremental impact on MetLife's earning per share for 2012 and 2013 and only roughly $0.05 per share in 2014.
We also examined the impact of the low interest rate environment on MetLife's return on equity. At our Investor Day in May, we said we expected to have an ROE of 12% to 14% by 2016. Even if the 10-year Treasury rate were to remain at 1.4% through the end of 2016, we would expect to hit the lower end of that range, adding roughly 100 basis points of ROE from this year's expected level despite the low interest rate environment. The impact of low interest rates on MetLife's earnings is more benign than many suspect for 2 main reasons. First, we still have room to adjust credit rates on a number of our products in response to changes in interest rates. And second, our hedging program has been highly effective. We made a forward-looking call in 2004 to start buying low rate protection when the 10-year Treasury was trading above 4%. We are reaping the benefits today, and we will continue to do so for a number of years to come.
Now let me discuss a few regulatory issues facing MetLife. With regard to debanking, regulatory approval for the sale of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital needs to be obtained from the FDIC. And the application for sale is pending with them. I know that investors are eager for resolution of this issue, but the timing is outside of MetLife's control. As I said last quarter, I'm not going to speculate as to when the FDIC will take final action. As soon as we have something to report, we will. Until then, we are not responding to questions about the status of the FDIC process. 
Looking ahead, a central regulatory issue for MetLife is whether we'll be named a nonbank systemically important financial institution and what the new prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs will look like. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has begun designating nonbank SIFIs. On July 18, FSOC applied the designation to 8 financial clearinghouses. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. In the event that certain insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact is a matter of public debate with some policy analysts focusing on the benefits and others focusing on the costs. My view is that the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. 
So far, Federal Reserve officials have signaled their intention to adapt the rules to the unique circumstances of nonbank financial firms. In recent congressional testimony, Fed officials have said the bank-centric capital rules would likely be a bad fit for insurance companies. There is a recognition that insurance companies have different asset and liability structures than banks and that the appropriate regulation needs to take that into account.
Now let me provide an update on recent M&A activity. As I've said previously, we take a portfolio view of our business, investing in markets we consider core and divesting from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Earlier this week, we closed on the sale of a significant portion of our Caribbean and Central American operations to Pan-American Life Insurance Group, which was initially announced last November. Also this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aviva plc's life insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, which expands MetLife's presence in growth markets in Eastern Europe. Our views on M&A remain consistent. Any transaction we pursue must compare favorably to alternative uses of capital. 
Before I hand the call over to Eric, I also want to take a moment to highlight the completion of the senior executive team here at MetLife. Yesterday, Chris Townsend started as our President for Asia based in Hong Kong. Chris comes to us from Chartis, where he served as CEO of their Asia Pacific region with 4,700 employees in 15 countries. Chris has a strong background in the area of capital management and portfolio optimization, as well as the direct-to-consumer business, which is an important part of our Asia operations.
And right after Labor Day, John Hele will be starting as MetLife's new CFO. John is a highly qualified Chief Financial Officer with over 30 years of broad experience in the financial services industry. He comes to us from Arch Capital Group, where he was Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer of ING Group, one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Earlier in his career, John spent 11 years with Merrill Lynch in investment banking, marketing and finance positions. 
Finally, I want to thank Eric Steigerwalt who has done an excellent job as Interim CFO. Upon the arrival of John Hele, Eric will devote himself full time to leading our Retail business and reporting to Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas division. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric."

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter.

MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, that benefited operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, our strong results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our businesses and our focus on pricing, underwriting and expense discipline across all of our regions. Interest margins were favorable due to strong variable investment income, which was significantly above our planned range and higher recurring net investment income. As we have stated in prior calls, we have been able to maintain strong spreads despite this low rate environment due to our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In addition, we continue to manage crediting rates prudently and have additional capacity to lower rates on our interest-rate-sensitive products.
In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in Non-Medical Health and had significant improvement in property/casualty as compared to the record catastrophes in the prior year quarter. We also had solid results in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 24.1% on a reported basis in the quarter and 23.2% when adjusting for pension and postretirement benefits. 
Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some significant items included in the second quarter results. Pretax variable investment income was $371 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $242 million, or $0.07 per share, above the top of our 2012 guidance range. This performance was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. I should remind you that we report our private equity funds on a one-quarter lag, therefore, we would expect that returns in our private equity portfolio in the third quarter will be impacted by market performance in the second quarter.
In the Americas, our property & casualty business incurred catastrophe losses of $94 million after tax, which was $44 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, above our second quarter plan provision of $50 million after tax. These higher-than-expected catastrophes were partially offset by a favorable non-cat prior year development reserve release, primarily in our auto business, of $25 million after tax, or $0.02 per share. 
In our Asia region, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $17 million, or $0.02 per share, due to a DAC model refinement in Japan. 
In our EMEA region, operating earnings benefited from a $12 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share, release of negative VOBA in Greece as customers have shifted away from interest-sensitive pension products to products with more liquidity.
And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had 2 individual items, which each negatively impacted earnings by a little over $0.01 per share. These items relate to expenses from our efficiency initiative and our Japan JV run-off book of business. 
Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by region. For the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this earnings growth were in our Retail and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segments. The Retail segment reported operating earnings of $380 million for the second quarter, up 14% as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the annuity segment. Operating earnings for annuities were $226 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year as the business continues to enjoy strong core spreads, higher fee income due to separate account asset growth and lower expenses, partially offset by market true-ups in the quarter. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, were 301 basis points in the quarter, down modestly from the record spreads in the first quarter but up 44 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to higher derivative income, primarily from interest rate floors, as well as lower crediting rates.
Our Group, Voluntary and Worksite segment reported operating earnings of $295 million for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year quarter, driven by the Non-Medical Health and property/casualty businesses. Non-Medical Health reported operating earnings of $133 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, mainly on improved underwriting earnings across the product set. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement in the ratios compared to the prior year quarter of 87.5% and well within our expectations.
In dental, our underwriting trends remain favorable as a result of stable utilization combined with our disciplined pricing strategy. Also, disability results improved due to a lower LTD incidence rate compared to the prior year quarter and plan. However, recoveries, while better than the prior year, continued to remain below plan in the second quarter. 
Property & casualty operating earnings were $44 million in the quarter, up $100 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophes as compared to the record prior year levels. That said, pretax catastrophe losses of $144 million were above our plan. The combined ratio for property & casualty was 102.3%, or 83.4% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This result was significantly better than the combined ratio of 121.7%, or 85.9% excluding cats in the second quarter of 2011.
Latin America operating earnings were $135 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 19% due to business growth across the region, operating synergies and higher investment yields. Also, underwriting results were favorable to plan, primarily in Mexico. We expect underwriting in Latin America to continue to be favorable for the balance of the year.
Mortality results in the U.S. were modestly unfavorable in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 87.3%, higher than the very strong prior year quarter of 82.1% but right within our expectations. Retail life's mortality ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, higher than the prior year quarter of 84.4%. However, reinsurance recoveries were better in the quarter, resulting in an improvement of overall underwriting results year-over-year.
Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year quarter. Higher separate account fees and retail annuities, solid dental premiums in Non-Medical Health were offset by lower pension closeouts. In Non-Medical Health, results this quarter reflect nearly $100 million of premiums from the TRICARE Dental contract, which became effective May 1. Also, in Latin America, while revenues were up 1% year-over-year, they were up 13% on a constant rate basis, driven by growth in accident and health and strong immediate annuity sales. 
Now let me turn to the Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $275 million, up 61% from $171 million in the prior year quarter and up 25% after adjusting for onetime items, most notably $44 million of higher claims and expenses in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We are seeing solid growth in new business in Japan, as well as strong persistency gains year-over-year, particularly for accident and health products. Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant rate basis. Growth was driven by new business in Japan and persistency gains in both Japan and Korea. In addition, total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by Japan, which was up 33% year-over-year, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and accident and health sales in Japan and A&H sales in China, as well as group sales in Australia.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $82 million, up 28% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 46% on a constant rate basis. This increase was due to expense improvements, business growth in several countries and the benefit of a onetime item in the quarter that I discussed earlier. EMEA premiums, fees and other revenues were $815 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant rate basis. Finally, EMEA sales grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven by Turkey, credit life sales in Russia and strong sales in our Gulf countries. This is a solid result despite the challenging market conditions across the region.
Now let me turn to investments. Let's start with our realized investment gains and losses. In the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $4 million. Included in this net gain were impairments of $36 million after-tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year. 
Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of June 30, our valuation allowance was $300 million, down from $368 million at the end of the first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 59% from 60% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of June 30, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $41 billion portfolio.
Finally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company. 
Now let me discuss the balance sheet and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at June 30 totaled approximately $5.3 billion, which is on track with our 2012 guidance. This includes a $1.5 billion residual capital remittance from our Japan operation in May as it converted from a branch to a subsidiary, offset by the deployment of $397 million as we repaid senior debt that matured in June. Our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 847% as of March 31, 2012, and well above our target ratio of 600%. Due to accounting rules, this included the effect of the plan residual capital remittance, which was largely offset by a surplus relief transaction that occurred in the first quarter.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our U.S. stat earnings and capital position. Our preliminary second quarter 2012 statutory operating earnings and net income for our domestic insurance companies were approximately $230 million and $630 million, respectively. The results were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go through the income statement but instead are reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital, or TAC, increased by $2.1 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets, and now stands at approximately $30 billion as of June 30. For the first 6 months of 2012, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. 
In conclusion, MetLife had another very good quarter. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth through pricing, underwriting, expense and investment discipline. As a result, we have been able to grow earnings, maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position in a very challenging environment. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions."

So we're remaining disciplined. I think MetLife has proven over the years that we don't get caught up in the frenzy of the moment in terms of buying properties. And I've said before that we're not going to adjust our standards around what is a good transaction or not a good transaction, either strategically or in terms of pricing of a deal based upon what the competition is doing. We're going to remain disciplined, and we're confident that we can, over time, make appropriate acquisitions at prices that make sense for our shareholders."

And there are number of people, I think, who were probably too aggressive. I think they're -- it's caught up with them and their results. And so I think they're showing a lot more discipline now, and that's just good for us. And I think the other thing, too, obviously, is that our underwriting discipline over the last couple of years, the contrast is pretty stark with some of our peers. So I think that's good. In terms of interest rates and how that might be influencing pricing, we've seen yet another kind of dip here in interest rates from the 10-year Treasuries sort of the 2-ish range down to 1.5. I think that I'm not sure everybody's caught up yet with that reality in terms of their pricing. And so I would guess you're going to see more pricing adjustments coming from the industry because of it. I think when interest rates get this low, obviously, that really starts to pressure ROIs, product sales. But it takes a little bit of time, I think, for pricing to adjust. And I'm sure some people probably think that, ""Gee, I'll just wait and I'm sure it will get better. How could it possibly get lower?"" But I think people have been making -- saying that line for quite a while, and now it's not come true. So we view this as an opportunity, obviously, to change prices if we need to in certain areas. And we've been pretty -- pricing pretty aggressively in places like UL. And obviously, the variable annuity business for quite some time now. And that's had an effect on our sales levels there, but I think that makes good sense to do."

But our new product sales ROIs in this quarter, even with relatively low interest rates, we calculate our ROI to be about high-13s as an average for the quarter. Probably by the end of the quarter, given where interest rates had moved to, it would probably move to something more like 13%. But we're changing some more of our features on our VAs. We're changing, altering the dollar-for-dollar feature, which I think will improve the ROI in the out quarters. So it's a big block. So it's hard to move the overall ROE there. But new product pricing is good. Secondly, with regard to disability, our book is really starting to turn. And you can see that. In terms of our underwriting results and the profitability of it, again, this is in pretty stark contrast to most of our peers in the group disability business who -- and I'm hard-pressed to actually explain why, but our book is different than theirs. And if you've been aggressive, I think you're getting punished for it. But incidence rates are down. Claim closure rates are still elevated.

If it is decided that insurance companies are deemed as being systemically risky, then the framework will come out of the Federal Reserve. At this point in time, we really don't have a great deal of insight as to how they will sort all that out. If they use more of a bank framework with a modification, we'll have to see the details of that to determine whether or not we think that is an appropriate way to regulate a company like ours. They have made statements on the record out of Washington at the most senior levels of the Fed, the Treasury that a purely banking model would not make sense in terms of regulating the insurance industries. So those are favorable comments from our perspective. But again, the details are going to be the key here, and those details have not been sorted out. They have not been finalized.

So sure, there's been -- when I say there's no interest rate sensitivity, a couple of quarters ago or 2 quarters ago, the ROI here was in the 15s or higher. So we have seen it tick down. I'm not real happy with high 13s, but I think given where interest rates are, that's pretty good.

So let's just review the bidding on what we did previously. We said that in the last interest rate presentation that Steve referred to, that we would have no stat reserve strengthening but that we expected to have modest actions year after year after year. We said there'd be no GAAP loss recognition in the U.S. We said we'd probably have, let's call it, $400 million to $450 million after-tax impact on DAC mostly occurring in the back end of that 5-year outlook. And we said there's potential pressure on Retirement Products goodwill. So at this point, and I'm just going to make a blanket statement here, anything I say here is going to be subject to what we learn in actual testing, okay, which is beginning, both for CFT, loss recognition, goodwill testing, et cetera, okay? So having said that, I think maybe the change here would be, I feel compelled to say that, modest stat reserves strengthening could be required if rates stay low. For GAAP loss recognition, as we think about it from the point of view of August 1 here, August 2, whatever date this is, we don't see a lot of loss recognition in the near term. But again, we'll have to see what happens as we go through testing. We still don't see, given our current methodology, a big DAC impact in the next couple of years. And I would certainly then finally add that there remains pressure on our goodwill, specifically for the Retirement Products. We're starting goodwill testing now, and we'll have to see where we come out as we get to the end of the year here. So I'm increasing it, using the word modest, but always subject to what we learn as we go through all the various tests."

The General Motors transaction, I think it's fair to view that as a bit of a catalyst. I think that's causing other corporate treasurers of large traditional companies with old traditional pension plans to think hard about what they should be doing. And certainly, there's a lot more conversation now than there was pre-GM. My expectation -- but the can of that, of course, is interest rates keep ticking down. And I think that makes pension closeouts more difficult. So there's contrary trend influences there. But I do think you'll see more deals, more big deals, despite the low interest rates. In terms of how we're approaching it, each -- a big pension closeout is a big sort of one-off transaction. It's not unfair to think of it like a big M&A deal. It's a large transfer of assets. So the capital considerations there are significant. And so we, just like an M&A deal or anything else, which is a big capital transaction, have to evaluate that capital that would get allocated to that deal versus other alternatives that are available to the company. We will not do a big closeout just so we can print a big deal, okay? If it doesn't add shareholder value and get us the right kind of returns on our capital, we will not do it. And so that's got to be our discipline. And look, I think our track record about having -- being disciplined about those kind of decisions is pretty good. So that's got to be how we look at it."

We're not very heavy into that market, and we're certainly not trying to compete with those kinds products. Latin America, the reason Latin America is really attractive to us is it's all about an emerging middle class that are first-time purchasers of life insurance. So life insurance as a percentage of GDP is growing very nicely, and then GDP itself is growing nicely. And there are markets that are developing. Our fastest-growing segments in Latin America right now are in direct marketing, okay, which, obviously, has nothing to do with interest rates, really. It's all about the channel management and driving growth. In general, I would tell you that we really do like Latin America. Obviously, it's a big segment for us. The returns are very good.

And we have to really look at this in a longer time frame because basically, right now, the markets are very volatile, probably driven by things like low rates, obviously, for our industry, regulatory overhang for larger insurers and so on. And that's driven up the perception in the marketplace about what our beta is. And it certainly is now closer to a 2 beta as opposed to historical norm closer to 1 or 1.1. So as we think about our business, I wouldn't, for example, on the flip side say if our beta drops just hypothetically to below 1, let's say 0.6 or something, that all of a sudden, we're going to print a bunch of business at 8%. We wouldn't think that would be the prudent thing to do longer term. Similarly, if things are spiking up because of near-term volatility out there, we have to kind of look past that at a short timeframe.

That's number one. In some of our portfolios, I think we're probably better cash flow matched than anybody externally would actually think. Third, we've got a lot of interest rate protection. We've got all of these floors and swaptions and swaps that we've talked about. Floor income year-over-year is meaningful and could continue to be meaningful depending on if rates stay here or, frankly, even if they went a little bit lower. I guess I'll give you a sense because I've know we've talked about it this publicly. Like in our UL block, 1/3 of that block is at minimum guarantees. So here where we are today, end of the second quarter, 1/3 of the block is at minimum guarantees.

There was a modest tick-up in claims activity this quarter, so underwriting results were down a little bit. But it wasn't very material. In terms of kind of managing the block, I used the word immunized it loosely, but we put in some very long-term interest rate swaps that are in that block to kind of really protect ourselves from just this sort of scenario. So we think we're managing interest rates really well there. That said, it's possible that there might need to be some stat. We might add the stat reserves. We have done that historically, I think you know, not necessarily because we absolutely had to but because we were starting to get close to the line. So we've been making installment payments. So all along the way in terms of long-term care, and I think that's been prudent. And the way that things have played out, it's really prudent. So we're in good shape, I think."

Before we discuss our financial results for the third quarter, I want to express my condolences to those who have suffered great loss as a result of Hurricane Sandy. At MetLife, we're doing everything we can help our customers cope with the impact of the storm. Our claims associates are on the ground helping customers find shelter, facilitating temporary repairs and issuing Advance Payments for immediate expenses. We know there are still is still a tremendous amount of work to do before our life returns to normal and our thoughts are especially with those who are hardest hit by the storm. I also want to thank all of you for being on this call under these difficult circumstances. 
Now let me turn to MetLife's financial performance. I would like to begin this morning by discussing the goodwill impairment we recorded in the third quarter of 2012. As we've indicated on previous earnings calls, as well as during our interest rate call last November, a prolonged low rate environment might cause us to impair some or all of the goodwill in our U.S. Retail annuity business. In the third quarter of 2012, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment in this business to reflect the expected market impact of continued low interest rates, changes in the regulatory environment and other market and economic factors. 
MetLife delivered another solid quarter with operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% from the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for certain onetime items that depressed the results in the prior year quarter, operating earnings still rose by 23%. John Hele will discuss our third quarter results in greater detail in a few moments. 
I would like to highlight a few aspects of MetLife's performance that tied to our enterprise strategy, which we developed to address the external economic environment facing life insurers. As you know, one of our strategic goals is to refocus the U.S. business by shifting our business mix from more capital-intensive and interest-rate-sensitive products to simpler protection and fee-based products. Our results in activities in the third quarter were consistent with this strategy. Premiums, fees and other revenues rose by 9% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits business on strong sales and on revenues from the TRICARE Dental contract. Variable annuity sales in the United States declined by 46% from the prior year quarter to $4.6 billion, in line with our plan. We continued to manage the risks associated with this business. 
During the quarter, we launched a new product with lower withdrawal and payout rates. In addition, we limited the ability to deposit new money into a number of our existing contracts to have more generous guarantees. 
In our Corporate Benefit Funding business, sales of structure settlements and pension closeouts were both down, reflecting the lumpy nature of this business segment. We see tremendous opportunity in the pension Closeout Business especially as interest rates rise over time. However, as with any use of capital, we are committed to ensuring that the new business in this segment clears our hurdle rate. 
During the quarter, MetLife also announced the creation of our new third-party Asset Management business. The fee-based business requires very little capital and leverages the strong investment expertise we've built up over the decades. We have well-established business platforms for originating commercial mortgages, investing in real estate equity and sourcing private placements. We also possess the talent, scale, reputation and in market presence to acquire high-quality assets with the potential for strong returns. 
Finally, I will point our pilot project with Walmart to sell term life policies to the middle market. While we are in a very early days and do not have reportable results, we will continue to pursue these kinds of innovative approaches to selling simple protection products through new direction channels. 
Another strategic imperative for MetLife is to grow our business in the emerging markets. The third quarter saw progress on this goal as well. In Latin America, sales rose 28% year-over-year, led by large group life cases in Mexico, and in EMEA, sales rose 15% year-over-year, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and higher credit life sales in Russia. 
Regarding the sale of MetLife Bank, 2 key developments occurred during the quarter. First, we amended the purchase agreement to sell the bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, which has submitted its application for approval to the office of the Comptroller of the currency. The key terms of agreement remain unchanged. 
And second, MetLife received a letter from the Federal Reserve granting us an extension until January 5, 2013, to file a revised capital plan. Until our debanking process is complete, we remain regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company. After our debanking process is complete, we face the possibility of being named a non-bank systemically important financial institution or SIFI, which would place us back under Federal Reserve supervision. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial systems. However, in the event that MetLife and other insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. It will be important that the prudential rules be tailored for the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks. 
Overall, I am pleased with the results MetLife delivered in the third quarter. Our continued solid operating earnings performance reflects the fundamental strength of our diverse global business. Our focus on pricing discipline and risk management is especially important in this challenging economic environment, which shows few signs of abating. We will continue to monitor the external factors impacting our business and respond accordingly. 
In the coming weeks, we'll be finalizing our 2013 plan projections which we'll share with you on our next Investor Day call this December 13. 
Before I conclude, I want to mention that this will be John McCallion's last earnings call as Head of Investor Relations. John's becoming the CFO of our EMEA region and I want to thank him for his help in communicating our value proposition to MetLife's investors over the past 2 years. John will be handing the reins to Ed, who has covered the insurance industry for more than 20 years as an equity analyst. 
It is now my pleasure to introduce John Hele, our new CFO. John has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry having worked for Arch Capital Group, ING Group and Merrill Lynch, among others. His deep technical expertise of world markets, knowledge of world markets and strong risk management skills are a welcome addition to our global leadership team. With that, I will turn the call over to John."

I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impacts to MetLife from Hurricane Sandy, at this time, it's too early to develop a reliable estimate. 
Before I review our results in the quarter, let me provide some color on the key macro factors impacting our financial performance. Interest rates continue to remain low in the U.S., assisted by another round of quantitative easing and also in most countries in which we operate. While the 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat in the quarter, closing at 1.63%, it is down nearly 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. In addition, and perhaps more significantly, U.S. corporate spreads further tightened in the quarter across most asset classes in which we invest, generally by 10 to 50 basis points. While asset spread tightening is not readily apparent in our product net spreads as provided in our quarterly financial supplement, they do impact our new money rates and will pressure product spreads over time. 
On the plus side, the U.S. equity market performed well this quarter with the S&P 500 up 5.8%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was down 14.4% in the third quarter of 2011. This change in the S&P 500 performance resulted in a positive year-over-year variance of approximately $120 million of after-tax operating earnings in our Retail annuities segment. 
With that as a backdrop, let me now discuss our results for this quarter. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. This quarter's results included a few offsetting significant items. However, the prior year third quarter had several significant items which had a net negative impact on operating earnings per share of $0.17. Adjusted for those items, operating earnings were up 23% year-over-year. 
In addition, as noted in our 8-K filed on October 24, in the third quarter of 2012, we began to report all MetLife Bank operations as divested businesses. This change in reporting positively impacted operating earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 while lowering operating earnings per share in the prior third quarter by $0.02. On a U.S. GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million or $0.92 per share, which includes a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment and net derivative losses of $467 million after-tax. 
As previously disclosed, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter. This year, the testing indicated a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the U.S. Retail annuities business, resulting in a noncash charge of $1.9 billion or $1.6 billion after tax. This includes $176 million of goodwill recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, representing tax benefits related to this annuity business. 
Goodwill testing starts with estimating the fair value of the business based on a market participant view. While interest rates have been low for some time, during the third quarter, U.S. Treasury rates hit their lowest point since World War II. Also the Federal Reserve extended the timeframe they see low interest rates being warranted until 2015 and also initiated quantitative easing tree. These factors indicated that an extended period of low interest rates needed to be reflected in the fair value estimate, particularly on the return to market buyer may assume associated with the fixed income portion of the separate accounts. We believe buyers of an annuity business, particularly of variable annuity block, will be looking for a capital-efficient structure, most likely one involving captive and or offshore strategies. Given the industrywide inquiries on the use of affiliated captive reinsurers, buyers may now discount the ability to fully utilize these structures. These and other market conditions, led to a significantly lower fair value for the business than in prior years. 
And when you follow through to the measurement step in the goodwill accounting process, this lower value resulted in full impairment of the recorded goodwill. This charge does not have an impact on the bank holding company capital ratios which exclude goodwill from the calculations nor on our U.S. statutory results. 
As for the potential DAC and GAAP loss recognition impairments, while we review each quarter, we conduct a comprehensive annual review of all the model assumptions in the fourth quarter, which include interest rates, equity returns, policy holder behavior, mortality, et cetera. We will need to complete our analysis before determining if there would be any impact in the fourth quarter. 
As for the net derivative losses in the quarter, it was primarily due to: one, the impact on the value of embedded options in our VA hedging program as a result of Met's own credit spreads tightening in the quarter; two, the rise in long-term rates; and three, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currency such as the euro, Canadian dollar and British pound in the quarter. 
Next I would like to discuss some of the key financial metrics we focus on each quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier, our investment spreads remain stable despite the lower rate environment and tighter corporate spreads. As stated on prior calls, there are several factors contributing to our stable spreads, including our discipline, use of industry rate floors, private asset originations and the performance of our variable investment income. 
In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $260 million, just above the top of a 2012 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $165 million. 
Next, expenses remain well controlled. Operating expenses in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up only 0.4% over the prior-year period. While the operating expense ratio did increase 30 basis points to 24.4%, the increase was primarily driven by lower revenues as a result of pension closeout sales in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding closeouts, the expense ratio would have been unchanged at 24.8% between the 2 periods. 
Turning to the top line revenue, premiums, fees and other revenues or PFOs, were $11.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and lower pension closeouts, PFOs were up 2% year-over-year. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $47.70 as of 9/30/12. This reflects growth of 2.6% year-over-year despite the goodwill impairment and net derivative losses discussed earlier. And finally, year-to-date 2012 operating ROE was 11.4%, up 140 basis points as compared to the comparable period for 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher operating earnings up $880 million on a year-to-date basis. 
Now let's discuss the business segments, starting with the Americas. The Americas operating earnings were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 58% year-over-year with growth across all segments, retail, life and other reported operating earnings of $204 million, up $83 million year-over-year due to higher net investment income. In addition, the prior year third quarter results of this business included $29 million after-tax off catastrophes in excess of plan in our Retail, property and casualty business and $27 million after-tax charge to increase reserves in connection with the company's use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to the company. 
Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $288 million, up $195 million year-over-year. As noted earlier, $120 million of the variance was due to the initial market impact related to the performance of the S&P 500 in their respective quarters. In addition, this business had an increase in separate account fees, improved interest margins due to wider spreads on the general account and lower expenses. 
Also, I should note that variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion in the quarter down 46% year-over-year. We continue to see sales trend down due to the pricing and derisking actions that we have taken this year. We would expect to see sales continue to decline in the fourth quarter, in line with our full 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $283 million, up $130 million year-over-year, largely due to the segment's prior year third quarter results, which included an $82 million after-tax charge related to the aforementioned Social Security Death Master File and $20 million after-tax charge for catastrophes in excess of plan in our group P&C business. In addition, the statement had favorable claim cost trends for dental, favorable catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience in group P&C, as well as improved interest and expense margins in disability. 
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $303 million, up $31 million year-over-year due to higher interest margins as a  result are general account asset growth and lower expenses. Spreads remained stable for the segment. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up $11 million year-over-year and 15% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were growth in Mexico and direct marketing in the region, higher net investment income driven by growth in the general account and a onetime tax-related benefit. 
Moving to the top line, the Americas' PFOs were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower pension closeouts and structured settlements. Excluding closeouts and structured settlements, PFOs would be up 3% year-over-year. 
The next segment, Asia, reported operating earnings of $259 million in the quarter, up $37 million or 17% year-over-year due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income driven by asset growth and higher yields. PFOs for the region were up 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, Japan PFOs were up 9% due to increase in life and A&H sales and improved efficiency while Korea's PFOs were up 11% due to higher fee income. 
In the third segment, EMEA, operating earnings were $62 million in the quarter, down $3 million year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, operating earnings would have been up $10 million, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and Russian credit insurance. PFOs were down 10% year-over-year and flat on a constant currency basis. The Turkey acquisition benefited the top line which is offset by weakness in Western Europe and Greece. 
Finally, let me discuss our capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at September 30 totaled approximately $5.7 billion. This includes proceeds from the issuance of $750 million of 30-year senior debt, which was completed in August which will be used to pay off maturing debt next year. I should note the balance sheet excludes the $1 billion of proceeds received in October from the remarketing and settlement of our common equity units. We also had $400 million of senior debt maturing in December which we will expect to repay at that time. 
Lastly, as we announced last week, we will be paying approximately $800 million in common dividends in December. Our preliminary U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and U.S. statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. For the 9 months of 2012, U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in line with our full year expectations. 
With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And then if rates do remain low, just your level of comfort with the rest of the goodwill on the balance sheet, I think it's around $10 billion and some of that relates to businesses that are interest-rate-sensitive as well?"

The impact of the other sides, thinner corporate spreads, as well as other economic factors, we'll have to take into account going forward.

It doesn't have to be a distressed price and it doesn't have to be literally at that month or even in that quarter. But as you factor forward and think about it over the course of the year or 2 years, you have to take into account reasonable transaction prices.

Their pensions are closed and their blocks have been close on retirees. So I think what's going on is, I think companies have said, you know what, I can't wait any longer for interest rates to improve. By the way, I have a very large pension obligation here. I can just start closing out pieces of it and maybe average into better interest rates over time. I also think they recognize that being a first mover here is probably a good thing. There is not an unlimited amount of capital today that's available to support pension closeout business, and I think those who feel like they go early are probably going to get better deals than those who go late. And who knows how that plays out, but I know that's a sentiment out there. So you're right.

Before we discuss our financial results for the third quarter, I want to express my condolences to those who have suffered great loss as a result of Hurricane Sandy. At MetLife, we are doing everything we can to help our customers cope with the impact of the storm. Our claims associates are on the ground helping customers find shelter, facilitating temporary repairs and issuing advance payments for immediate expenses. We know there is still a tremendous amount of work to do before life returns to normal, and our thoughts are especially with those who are hardest hit by the storm. I also want to thank all of you for being on this call under these difficult circumstances. 
Now let me turn to MetLife's financial performance. I would like to begin this morning by discussing the goodwill impairment we recorded in the third quarter of 2012. As we've indicated on previous earnings calls, as well as during our interest rate call last November, a prolonged low-rate environment might cause us to impair some or all of the goodwill in our U.S. retail annuity business. In the third quarter of 2012, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment in this business to reflect the expected market impact of continued low interest rates, changes in the regulatory environment and other market and economic factors. 
MetLife delivered another solid quarter with operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% from the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for certain onetime items that depressed the results in the prior year quarter, operating earnings still rose by 23%. John Hele will discuss our third quarter results in greater detail in a few moments. 
I would like to highlight a few aspects of MetLife's performance that tied to our enterprise strategy, which we developed to address the external economic environment facing life insurers. 
As you know, one of our strategic goals is to refocus the U.S. business by shifting our business mix from more capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products to simpler protection and fee-based products. Our results and activities in the third quarter were consistent with this strategy. Premiums, fees and other revenues rose by 9% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefit business on strong sales and on revenues from the TRICARE Dental contract. Variable annuity sales in the United States declined by 46% from the prior year quarter to $4.6 billion, in line with our plan. We continued to manage the risks associated with this business. 
During the quarter, we launched a new product with lower withdrawal and payout rates. In addition, we limited the ability to deposit new money into a number of our existing contracts that have more generous guarantees. 
In our Corporate Benefit Funding business, sales of structured settlements and pension closeouts were both down, reflecting the lumpy nature of this business segment. We see tremendous opportunity in the pension closeout business especially as interest rates rise over time. However, as with any use of capital, we are committed to ensuring that the new business in this segment clears our hurdle rate. 
During the quarter, MetLife also announced the creation of our new third-party asset-management business. This fee-based business requires very little capital and leverages the strong investment expertise we've built up over the decades. We have well-established business platforms for originating commercial mortgages, investing in real estate equity and sourcing private placements. We also possess the talent, scale, reputation and in-market presence to acquire high-quality assets with the potential for strong returns. 
Finally, I would point to our pilot project with Walmart to sell term life policies to the middle market. While we are in a very early days and do not have reportable results, we will continue to pursue these kinds of innovative approaches to selling simple protection products through new direct channels. 
Another strategic imperative for MetLife is to grow our business in emerging markets. The third quarter saw progress on this goal as well. In Latin America, sales rose 28% year-over-year, led by large group life cases in Mexico. And in EMEA, sales rose 15% year-over-year, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and higher credit life sales in Russia. 
Regarding the sale of MetLife Bank, 2 key developments occurred during the quarter: first, we amended the purchase agreement to sell the bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, which has submitted its application for approval to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The key terms of agreement remain unchanged. 
And second, MetLife received a letter from the Federal Reserve granting us an extension until January 5, 2013, to file a revised capital plan. 
Until our debanking process is complete, we remain regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank-holding company. After our debanking process is complete, we face the possibility of being named a non-bank systemically important financial institution or SIFI, which would place us back under Federal Reserve supervision. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. However, in the event that MetLife and other insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. It will be important that the prudential rules be tailored for the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks. 
Overall, I am pleased with the results MetLife delivered in the third quarter. Our continued solid operating earnings performance reflects the fundamental strength of our diverse global business. Our focus on pricing discipline and risk management is especially important in this challenging economic environment, which shows few signs of abating. We will continue to monitor the external factors impacting our business and respond accordingly. 
In the coming weeks, we'll be finalizing our 2013 plan projections, which we will share with you on our next Investor Day call this December 13. 
Before I conclude, I want to mention that this will be John McCallion's last earnings call as Head of Investor Relations. John is becoming the CFO of our EMEA region, and I want to thank him for his help in communicating our value proposition to MetLife's investors over the past 2 years. John will be handing the reins to Ed Spehar who has covered the insurance industry for more than 20 years as an equity analyst. 
It is now my pleasure to introduce John Hele, our new CFO. John has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, having worked for Arch Capital Group, ING Group and Merrill Lynch, among others. His deep technical expertise of world markets -- knowledge of world markets and strong risk management skills are a welcome addition to our global leadership team. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John."
185648,222416429,375223,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and/or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impacts to MetLife from Hu",1901,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and/or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impacts to MetLife from Hurricane Sandy, at this time, it is too early to develop a reliable estimate. 
Before I review our results in the quarter, let me provide some color on the key macro factors impacting our financial performance. Interest rates continue to remain low in the U.S., assisted by another round of quantitative easing and also in most countries in which we operate. While the 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat in the quarter, closing at 1.63%, it is down nearly 30 basis points versus the year ago period. In addition, and perhaps more significantly, U.S. corporate spreads further tightened in the quarter across most asset classes in which we invest, generally by 10 to 50 basis points. While asset spread tightening is not readily apparent in our product net spreads as provided in our quarterly financial supplement, they do impact our new money rates and will pressure product spreads over time. 
On the plus side, the U.S. equity market performed well this quarter with the S&P 500 up 5.8%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was down 14.4% in the third quarter of 2011. This change in the S&P 500 performance resulted in a positive year-over-year variance of approximately $120 million of after-tax operating earnings in our retail annuities segment. 
With that as a backdrop, let me now discuss our results for this quarter. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. This quarter's results included a few offsetting significant items. However, the prior year third quarter had several significant items, which had a net negative impact on operating earnings per share of $0.17. Adjusted for those items, operating earnings were up 23% year-over-year. 
In addition, as noted in our 8-K filed on October 24, in the third quarter of 2012, we began to report all MetLife Bank operations as divested businesses. This change in reporting positively impacted operating earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 while lowering operating earnings per share in the prior third quarter by $0.02. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million or $0.92 per share, which includes a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment and net derivative losses of $467 million after tax. 
As previously disclosed, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter. This year, the testing indicated a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the U.S. retail annuities business, resulting in a noncash charge of $1.9 billion or $1.6 billion after tax. This includes $176 million of goodwill recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, representing tax benefits related to this annuity business. 
Goodwill testing starts with the estimating the fair value of the business based on a market participant view. While interest rates have been low for some time, during the third quarter, U.S. Treasury rates hit their lowest point since World War II. Also, the Federal Reserve extended the time frame they see low interest rates being warranted until 2015 and also initiated Quantitative Easing 3. These factors indicated that an extended period of low interest rates needed to be reflected in the fair value estimate, particularly on the return to market buyer may assume associated with the fixed income portion of the separate accounts. We believe buyers of an annuity business, particularly a variable annuity block, will be looking for capital-efficient structure, most likely one involving captive and/or offshore strategies. Given the industry-wide inquiries on the use of affiliated captive reinsurers, buyers may now discount the ability to fully utilize these structures. These, and other market conditions, led to a significantly lower fair value for the business than in prior years. 
And when you follow through to the measurement step in the goodwill accounting process, this lower value resulted in full impairment of the recorded goodwill. This charge does not have an impact on the bank holding company capital ratios, which exclude goodwill from the calculations nor on our U.S. statutory results. 
As for the potential DAC and GAAP loss recognition impairments, while we review these each quarter, we conduct a comprehensive annual review of all the model assumptions in the fourth quarter, which include interest rates, equity returns, policyholder behavior, mortality, et cetera. We will need to complete our analysis before determining if there would be any impact in the fourth quarter. 
As for the net derivative losses in the quarter, it was primarily due to: one, the impact on the value of embedded options in our VA hedging program as a result of MET's own credit spreads tightening in the quarter; two, the rise in long-term rates; and three, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currency such as the euro, Canadian dollar and British pound in the quarter. 
Next, I would like to discuss some of the key financial metrics we focus on each quarter: first, as I mentioned earlier, our investment spreads remain stable despite the lower-rate environment and tighter corporate spreads. As stated on prior calls, there are several factors contributing to our stable spreads, including our ALM discipline, use of interest rate floors, private asset originations and the performance of our variable investment income. 
In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $260 million, just above the top of our 2012 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $165 million. 
Next, expenses remain well controlled. Operating expenses in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up only 0.4% over the prior year period. While the operating expense ratio did increase 30 basis points to 24.4%, the increase was primarily driven by lower revenues as a result of pension closeout sales in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding closeouts, the expense ratio would have been unchanged at 24.8% between the 2 periods. 
Turning to the top line revenue. Premiums, fees & other revenues, or PFOs, were $11.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and lower pension closeouts, PFOs were up 2% year-over-year. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.70 as of 9/30/12. This reflects growth of 2.6% year-over-year despite the goodwill impairment and net derivative losses discussed earlier. 
And finally, year-to-date 2012 operating ROE was 11.4%, up 140 basis points as compared to the comparable period for 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher operating earnings, up $880 million on a year-to-date basis. 
Now let's discuss the business segments, starting with the Americas. The Americas operating earnings were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 58% year-over-year with growth across all segments. Retail, life and other reported operating earnings of $204 million, up $83 million year-over-year due to higher net investment income. In addition, the prior year third quarter results of this business included $29 million, after tax, of catastrophes in excess of plan in our retail, property & casualty business and $27 million after-tax charge to increase reserves in connection with the company's use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to the company. 
Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $288 million, up $195 million year-over-year. As noted earlier, $120 million of the variance was due to the initial market impact related to the performance of the S&P 500 in their respective quarters. In addition, this business had an increase in separate account fees, improved interest margins due to wider spreads on the general account and lower expenses. 
Also, I should note that variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion in the quarter, down 46% year-over-year. We continue to see sales trend down due to the pricing and derisking actions that we have taken this year. We would expect to see sales continue to decline in the fourth quarter, in line with our full 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $283 million, up $130 million year-over-year, largely due to the segment's prior year third quarter results, which included an $82 million after-tax charge related to the aforementioned Social Security Death Master File and $20 million after-tax charge for catastrophes in excess of plan in our group P&C business. In addition, this segment had favorable claim cost trends for dental, favorable catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience in group P&C, as well as improved interest and expense margins and disability. 
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $303 million, up $31 million year-over-year due to higher interest margins as a  result of general account asset growth and lower expenses. Spreads remained stable for this segment. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up $11 million year-over-year and 15% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were growth in Mexico and direct marketing in the region; higher net investment income, driven by growth in the general account; and a onetime tax-related benefit. 
Moving to the top line. The Americas' PFOs were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower pension closeouts and structured settlements. Excluding closeouts and structured settlements, PFOs would be up 3% year-over-year. 
The next segment, Asia, reported operating earnings of $259 million in the quarter, up $37 million or 17% year-over-year, due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income, driven by asset growth and higher yields. PFOs for the region were up 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, Japan PFOs were up 9% due to an increase in life and A&H sales and improved persistency while Korea's PFOs were up 11% due to higher fee income. 
In the third segment, EMEA, operating earnings were $62 million in the quarter, down $3 million year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, operating earnings would have been up $10 million, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and Russian credit insurance. PFOs were down 10% year-over-year and flat on a constant currency basis. The Turkey acquisition benefited the top line, which is offset by weakness in Western Europe and Greece. 
Finally, let me discuss our capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at September 30 totaled approximately $5.7 billion. This includes proceeds from the issuance of $750 million of 30-year senior debt, which was completed in August, which will be used to pay off maturing debt next year. I should note the balance sheet excludes the $1 billion of proceeds received in October from the remarketing and settlement of our common equity units. We also had $400 million of senior debt maturing in December, which we would expect to repay at that time. 
Lastly, as we announced last week, we will be paying approximately $800 million in common dividends in December. 
Our preliminary U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and U.S. statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. For the 9 months of 2012, U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in line with our full year expectations. 
With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Okay.

And so sales were a little inflated. We're -- our run rate in the fourth quarter is meaningfully below the $4.6 billion that we recorded in the third. And so we are seeing changes in that number and that's why we're confident that we'll be at $18 billion. With regard to the Corporate Benefit Funding or the closeouts, as we've talked about on a number of calls, we are seeing more large closeout activity and I expect that to continue, though the deals are lumpy and there won't necessarily be one in every quarter. We are competing for that business, but we are being very disciplined about achieving our hurdle rates, something that we're doing across-the-board in all our businesses and this is no different."

But when the disclosure changes every 3 or 4 quarters, it's just hard to keep track of stuff. But the question that I have is, on the international business. The results obviously have been moving it on by division. Europe hasn't been that great; Asia has been strong, weak in other quarters. But maybe you could talk about how the ALICO business has done since the acquisition, where it's done better than maybe what you would have expected and where it might have not done as well. Because if you look at -- look back a year or so ago, the Asian business seems like it's actually the earnings are emerging a little bit weaker than I would have thought.

The impact of the other side's thinner corporate spreads, as well as other economic factors we'll have to take into account going forward.

It doesn't have to be a distressed price and it doesn't have to be literally at that month or even in that quarter. But as you factor forward and think about it over the course of the year or 2 years, you have to take into account reasonable transaction prices. Given there haven't been any variable annuity blocks sold is another key factor that there's pressure on prices clearly, even though they perhaps have been willing sellers. So you have to take all of these into account and when we came up in really many different measures of it and ways of thinking about it, really, as if you were thinking of buying a block of business, people use different techniques to value businesses, including multiples, price-to-book multiples, price-to-earnings multiples, actual appraisals.

Just if you pull back a minute, obviously, with this low interest rate environment, the VA business, especially the in-force block, is not performing terribly well with regard to the exposure to interest rates and such. On our new sales, our new sales this quarter had a 14% ROI and that's with a full economic capital allocation using today's environment. So we view that as pretty attractive business and so we're being tough-minded about annuities and making sure that our risk exposure there doesn't grow too much relative to MetLife overall. But this business is profitable for us. And certainly, today's sales are profitable. And this is a consumer need, which is isn't going to go away and is a part of all our customers' financial planning as they deal with retirement. And so this is a business we like.

By the way, I have a very large pension obligation here. I can just start closing out pieces of it and maybe average into better interest rates over time. I also think they recognize that being a first mover here is probably a good thing. There is not an unlimited amount of capital today that's available to support pension closeout business and I think those who feel like they go early are probably going to get better deals than those who go late.

Before we discuss our financial results for the third quarter, I want to express my condolences to those who have suffered great loss as a result of Hurricane Sandy. At MetLife, we are doing everything we can to help our customers cope with the impact of the storm. Our claims associates are on the ground helping customers find shelter, facilitating temporary repairs and issuing advance payments for immediate expenses. We know there is still a tremendous amount of work to do before life returns to normal, and our thoughts are especially with those who are hardest hit by the storm. I also want to thank all of you for being on this call under these difficult circumstances. 
Now let me turn to MetLife's financial performance. I would like to begin this morning by discussing the goodwill impairment we recorded in the third quarter of 2012. As we've indicated on previous earnings calls, as well as during our interest rate call last November, a prolonged low-rate environment might cause us to impair some or all of the goodwill in our U.S. retail annuity business. In the third quarter of 2012, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment in this business to reflect the expected market impact of continued low interest rates, changes in the regulatory environment and other market and economic factors. 
MetLife delivered another solid quarter with operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% from the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for certain onetime items that depressed the results in the prior year quarter, operating earnings still rose by 23%. John Hele will discuss our third quarter results in greater detail in a few moments. 
I would like to highlight a few aspects of MetLife's performance that tie to our enterprise strategy, which we developed to address the external economic environment facing life insurers. 
As you know, one of our strategic goals is to refocus the U.S. business by shifting our business mix from more capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products to simpler protection and fee-based products. Our results and activities in the third quarter were consistent with this strategy. Premiums, fees and other revenues rose by 9% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefit business on strong sales and on revenues from the TRICARE Dental contract. Variable annuity sales in the United States declined by 46% from the prior year quarter to $4.6 billion, in line with our plan. We continued to manage the risk associated with this business. 
During the quarter, we launched a new product with lower withdrawal and payout rates. In addition, we limited the ability to deposit new money into a number of our existing contracts that have more generous guarantees. 
In our Corporate Benefit Funding business, sales of structured settlements and pension closeouts were both down, reflecting the lumpy nature of this business segment. We see tremendous opportunity in the pension closeout business, especially as interest rates rise over time. However, as with any use of capital, we are committed to ensuring that the new business in this segment clears our hurdle rate. 
During the quarter, MetLife also announced the creation of our new third-party asset-management business. This fee-based business requires very little capital and leverages the strong investment expertise we've built up over the decades. We have well-established business platforms for originating commercial mortgages, investing in real estate equity and sourcing private placements. We also possess the talent, scale, reputation and in-market presence to acquire high-quality assets with the potential for strong returns. 
Finally, I would point to our pilot project with Walmart to sell term life policies to the middle market. While we are in the very early days and do not have reportable results, we will continue to pursue these kinds of innovative approaches to selling simple protection products through new direct channels. 
Another strategic imperative for MetLife is to grow our business in emerging markets. The third quarter saw progress on this goal as well. In Latin America, sales rose 28% year-over-year, led by large group life cases in Mexico. And in EMEA, sales rose 15% year-over-year, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and higher credit life sales in Russia. 
Regarding the sale of MetLife Bank, 2 key developments occurred during the quarter: first, we amended the purchase agreement to sell the bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, which has submitted its application for approval to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The key terms of the agreement remain unchanged. 
And second, MetLife received a letter from the Federal Reserve granting us an extension until January 5, 2013, to file a revised capital plan. 
Until our debanking process is complete, we remain regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank-holding company. After our debanking process is complete, we face the possibility of being named a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, which would place us back under Federal Reserve supervision. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. However, in the event that MetLife and other insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. It will be important that the prudential rules be tailored for the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks. 
Overall, I am pleased with the results MetLife delivered in the third quarter. Our continued solid operating earnings performance reflects the fundamental strength of our diverse global business. Our focus on pricing discipline and risk management is especially important in this challenging economic environment, which shows few signs of abating. We will continue to monitor the external factors impacting our business and respond accordingly. 
In the coming weeks, we'll be finalizing our 2013 plan projections, which we will share with you on our next Investor Day call this December 13. 
Before I conclude, I want to mention that this will be John McCallion's last earnings call as Head of Investor Relations. John is becoming the CFO of our EMEA region, and I want to thank him for his help in communicating our value proposition to MetLife's investors over the past 2 years. John will be handing the reins to Ed Spehar, who has covered the insurance industry for more than 20 years as an equity analyst. 
It is now my pleasure to introduce John Hele, our new CFO. John has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, having worked for Arch Capital Group, ING Group and Merrill Lynch, among others. His deep technical expertise of world markets -- knowledge of world markets and strong risk management skills are a welcome addition to our global leadership team. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John."
185648,222416429,375506,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and/or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impact to MetLife from Hur",1901,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and/or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impact to MetLife from Hurricane Sandy, at this time, it is too early to develop a reliable estimate. 
Before I review our results in the quarter, let me provide some color on the key macro factors impacting our financial performance. Interest rates continue to remain low in the U.S., assisted by another round of quantitative easing and also in most countries in which we operate. While the 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat in the quarter, closing at 1.63%, it is down nearly 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. In addition, and perhaps more significantly, U.S. corporate spreads further tightened in the quarter across most asset classes in which we invest, generally by 10 to 50 basis points. While asset spread tightening is not readily apparent in our product net spreads as provided in our quarterly financial supplement, they do impact our new money rates and will pressure product spreads over time. 
On the plus side, the U.S. equity market performed well this quarter with the S&P 500 up 5.8%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was down 14.4% in the third quarter of 2011. This change in the S&P 500 performance resulted in a positive year-over-year variance of approximately $120 million of after-tax operating earnings in our retail annuities segment. 
With that as a backdrop, let me now discuss our results for this quarter. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. This quarter's results included a few offsetting significant items. However, the prior year third quarter had several significant items, which had a net negative impact on operating earnings per share of $0.17. Adjusted for those items, operating earnings were up 23% year-over-year. 
In addition, as noted in our 8-K filed on October 24, in the third quarter of 2012, we began to report all MetLife Bank operations as divested businesses. This change in reporting positively impacted operating earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 while lowering operating earnings per share in the prior third quarter by $0.02. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million or $0.92 per share, which includes a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment and net derivative losses of $467 million after tax. 
As previously disclosed, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter. This year, the testing indicated a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the U.S. retail annuities business, resulting in a noncash charge of $1.9 billion or $1.6 billion after tax. This includes $176 million of goodwill recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, representing tax benefits related to this annuity business. 
Goodwill testing starts with the -- estimating the fair value of the business based on a market participant view. While interest rates have been low for some time, during the third quarter, U.S. Treasury rates hit their lowest point since World War II. Also, the Federal Reserve extended the time frame they see low interest rates being warranted until 2015 and also initiated Quantitative Easing 3. These factors indicated that an extended period of low interest rates needed to be reflected in the fair value estimate, particularly on the return to market buyer may assume associated with the fixed income portion of the separate accounts. We believe buyers of an annuity business, particularly a variable annuity block, will be looking for a capital-efficient structure, most likely one involving captive and/or offshore strategies. Given the industry-wide inquiries on the use of affiliated captive reinsurers, buyers may now discount the ability to fully utilize these structures. These, and other market conditions, led to a significantly lower fair value for the business than in prior years. 
And when you follow through to the measurement step in the goodwill accounting process, this lower value resulted in full impairment of the recorded goodwill. This charge does not have an impact on the bank holding company capital ratios, which exclude goodwill from the calculations nor on our U.S. statutory results. 
As for the potential DAC and GAAP loss recognition impairments, while we review these each quarter, we conduct a comprehensive annual review of all the model assumptions in the fourth quarter, which include interest rates, equity returns, policyholder behavior, mortality, et cetera. We will need to complete our analysis before determining if there would be any impact in the fourth quarter. 
As for the net derivative losses in the quarter, it was primarily due to: one, the impact on the value of embedded options in our VA hedging program as a result of MET's own credit spreads tightening in the quarter; two, the rise in long-term rates; and three, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currency such as the euro, Canadian dollar and British pound in the quarter. 
Next, I would like to discuss some of the key financial metrics we focus on each quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier, our investment spreads remain stable despite the low-rate environment and tighter corporate spreads. As stated on prior calls, there are several factors contributing to our stable spreads, including our ALM discipline, use of interest rate floors, private asset originations and the performance of our variable investment income. 
In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $260 million, just above the top of our 2012 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $165 million. 
Next, expenses remain well controlled. Operating expenses in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up only 0.4% over the prior-year period. While the operating expense ratio did increase 30 basis points to 24.4%, the increase was primarily driven by lower revenues as a result of pension closeout sales in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding closeouts, the expense ratio would have been unchanged at 24.8% between the 2 periods. 
Turning to the top line revenue. Premiums, fees & other revenues, or PFOs, were $11.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and lower pension closeouts, PFOs were up 2% year-over-year. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.70 as of 9/30/12. This reflects growth of 2.6% year-over-year despite the goodwill impairment and net derivative losses discussed earlier. 
And finally, year-to-date 2012 operating ROE was 11.4%, up 140 basis points as compared to the comparable period for 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher operating earnings, up $880 million on a year-to-date basis. 
Now let's discuss the business segments, starting with the Americas. The Americas operating earnings were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 58% year-over-year with growth across all segments. Retail, life and other reported operating earnings of $204 million, up $83 million year-over-year due to higher net investment income. In addition, the prior year third quarter results of this business included $29 million after tax of catastrophes in excess of plan in our retail, property & casualty business and $27 million after-tax charge to increase reserves in connection with the company's use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to the company. 
Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $288 million, up $195 million year-over-year. As noted earlier, $120 million of the variance was due to the initial market impact related to the performance of the S&P 500 in their respective quarters. In addition, this business had an increase in separate account fees, improved interest margins due to wider spreads on the general account and lower expenses. 
Also, I should note that variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion in the quarter, down 46% year-over-year. We continue to see sales trend down due to the pricing and derisking actions that we have taken this year. We would expect to see sales continue to decline in the fourth quarter, in line with our full 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $283 million, up $130 million year-over-year, largely due to the segment's prior year third quarter results, which included an $82 million after-tax charge related to the aforementioned Social Security Death Master File and $20 million after-tax charge for catastrophes in excess of plan in our group P&C business. In addition, this segment had favorable claim cost trends for dental, favorable catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience in group P&C, as well as improved interest and expense margins and disability. 
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $303 million, up $31 million year-over-year due to higher interest margins as a result of general account asset growth and lower expenses. Spreads remained stable for this segment. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up $11 million year-over-year and 15% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were growth in Mexico and direct marketing in the region; higher net investment income, driven by growth in the general account; and a onetime tax-related benefit. 
Moving to the top line. The Americas' PFOs were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower pension closeouts and structured settlements. Excluding closeouts and structured settlements, PFOs would be up 3% year-over-year. 
The next segment, Asia, reported operating earnings of $259 million in the quarter, up $37 million or 17% year-over-year, due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income, driven by asset growth and higher yields. PFOs for the region were up 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, Japan PFOs were up 9% due to an increase in life and A&H sales and improved persistency, while Korea's PFOs were up 11% due to higher fee income. 
In the third segment, EMEA, operating earnings were $62 million in the quarter, down $3 million year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, operating earnings would have been up $10 million, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and Russian credit insurance. PFOs were down 10% year-over-year and flat on a constant currency basis. The Turkey acquisition benefited the top line, which is offset by weakness in Western Europe and Greece. 
Finally, let me discuss our capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at September 30 totaled approximately $5.7 billion. This includes proceeds from the issuance of $750 million of 30-year senior debt, which was completed in August, which will be used to pay off maturing debt next year. I should note the balance sheet excludes the $1 billion of proceeds received in October from the remarketing and settlement of our common equity units. We also have $400 million of senior debt maturing in December, which we would expect to repay at that time. 
Lastly, as we announced last week, we will be paying approximately $800 million in common dividends in December. 
Our preliminary U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and U.S. statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. For the 9 months of 2012, U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in line with our full year expectations. 
With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

But when the disclosure changes every 3, 4 quarters, it's just hard to keep track of stuff. But the question that I have is on the international business. The results obviously have been moving around by division. Europe hasn't been that great; Asia has been strong, weak in other quarters. But maybe you could talk about how the ALICO business has done since the acquisition and where it's done better than maybe what you would have expected and where it might have not done as well. Because if you look at -- look back a year or so ago, the Asian business seems like it's actually the earnings are emerging a little bit weaker than I would have thought.

Remember, spreads are basically at their long-term averages right now. Yes, they've tightened significantly over the course of the year, but that's from very, very wide levels. So we're not surprised at all at the levels of spreads, and we continue to practice good ALM around that. Regarding hedges, also think back to the presentations that we made earlier this year and even last year where we did show you the fact that our protection runs out for a number of years, in fact, even into the next decade. So we have a lot of protection in place, and certainly for the next several years, we're very well protected."

But in reviewing the prior year's goodwill analysis, it was passing, but not by a large amount, so the price-to-book was just above from a fair value perspective, and now, it is below. And in a goodwill test, it's an assessment or trying to come with a fair value, meaning what would a -- this block or this business transact in the current environment between a willing seller and a willing buyer. It doesn't have to be a distressed price, and it doesn't have to be literally at that month or even in that quarter. But as you factor forward and think about it over the course of a year or 2 years, you have to take into account reasonable transaction prices. Given there haven't been any variable annuity blocks sold is another key factor that there's pressure on prices clearly, even though there perhaps have been some willing sellers. So you have to take all these into account and when we came up in really many different measures of it and ways of thinking about it, really, as if you were thinking of buying a block of business, people use different techniques to value businesses, including multiples, price-to-book multiples, price-to-earnings multiples, actual appraisals.

Bill, why are these pension closeouts taking now -- taking place now? The reason I ask is that some plans have been underfunded for a while. The supposed new accounting rules that create all this volatility on balance sheets and income statements, I don't think are new, they're 3 years old. The Pension Protection Act, which makes it harder for companies to maintain underfundedness, was passed 7 years ago. So why now on these pension closeouts, especially given the extremely low level of interest rates, which, I believe, will act as an impediment to them?"

We -- if you remember, and I know you do, we've been a big -- talking about large pension closeout opportunities for a long time, and of course, nothing happened until very recently. And in talking to the treasurers of companies who have these large pensions, one, they're not being -- in most cases, they're obviously not being used as a benefit anymore. Their pensions are closed and the blocks that have been closed out are on retirees, in any case. so I think what's going on is even if -- I think companies have said, you know what, I can't wait any longer for interest rates to improve. By the way, I have a very large pension obligation here. I can just start closing out pieces of it and maybe average into better interest rates over time. I also think they recognize that being a first mover here is probably a good thing. There is not an unlimited amount of capital today that's available to support pension closeout business, and I think those who feel like they go early are probably going to get better deals than those who go late. And who knows how that will play out. But I know that's the sentiment out there. So you're right. In some cases, you would think that this would not be an ideal time, but I think what's happening is companies have decided they just can't wait any longer and they should get going."
