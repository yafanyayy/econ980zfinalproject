It's always a shame to waste someone's reading the safe harbor language, but she has to do it. 2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating performance. We grew the company through acquisitions",1593,"Good morning, everybody. It's always a shame to waste someone's reading the safe harbor language, but she has to do it. 2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating performance. We grew the company through acquisitions, which are working on both on earnings and cash flow basis. We made progress on a range of regulatory, legislative and market issues, and we are getting ever closer to consummating our merger with Constellation.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.82 per share. While December was a little disappointing due mostly to whether, our full year 2011 operating earnings per share of $4.16 were within our final guidance range, better than our 2010 results and well above our original expectations for the year. Our leading drivers in '11 were the strong performance of the generation fleet, led of course by our ninth consecutive year of over 93% capacity factors in nuclear that's helped significantly by our Texas operations. Tax benefits helped us a great deal. The impact of the Illinois Energy Infrastructure modernization act was positive, as was our summer weather. 
The good news was partially offset by costly storms at both ComEd and PECO and lower than weather normalized load at PECO. ComEd had a terrible July storm wise, which we soaked up successfully, and PECO had both a hurricane and a freak fall snowstorm. Matt will review the quarter-over-quarter and full-year financial drivers in more detail.
As you know, we made a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension at the beginning of the year, which along with the Browns fine work on asset allocation, allowed us to end the year at 83% funded status. And remember, this is with very low discount rates. The contribution gives us added cushion in our FFO to debt credit metrics and will help us see the company through the current and power crisis. We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends.
We are keenly aware that to all of you, the dividend is an absolutely critical part of our value proposition. It's what makes it possible for you to hold on with us while we work our way through the gas and power price drop. Our cash flows and credit metrics support our dividend and capital programs even as we accept a higher payout ratio. Chris Crane will answer most of the questions today about future performance, believes as I do in the continued importance to the dividend. Simply put, we get it, and he is as committed as I am to maintaining it.
As we have mentioned previously, given our pending merger with Constellation, we are not providing full year Exelon standalone guidance for 2012 on today's call. We will provide combined company guidance at an analyst day that we expect to hold after -- in the spring after the merger closes.
Turning to our operating results, I simply have to recognize Chip Pardee, Susan and their team for Nuclear's fine pine year. Their capacity factor was 93.3% for 2011. As I said earlier, that is the ninth consecutive year they had beaten 93%. This is just a tremendous performance. They continue to renew their commitment. They continue to sharpen their edge. We are very, very proud of what our nuclear folks are doing. Exelon continues to be a leader in U.S. and other operations as we must be. 
Both ComEd and PECO faced significant storms in 2011. PECO's response to very large storms was absolutely best I've ever seen and far better than most of the other Northeastern utilities, many of which more than a little trouble. Despite its summer storms, ComEd outage frequency statistics were the best on record, both delivery companies keep getting better.
Our power fleet in Texas led by Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg was very helpful to our earnings in both the first and the third quarters. 
Beyond the merger with Constellation, which is of course our major strategic endeavor, and I will cover it a little later, we added significantly to our generation fleet in 2011. Our Exelon Wind business and the addition of the Wolf Hollow combined cycle gas turbine in ERCOT added more than $40 million in earnings in 2011.
Exelon Nuclear added 138 megawatts of clean and profitable energy to our power upgrade program in 2011. In September, we added 230 megawatts of solar generation to our clean energy development pipeline with the acquisition of Antelope Valley Solar ranch, to be funded in part to a DOE loan guarantee and backed by long-term power purchase agreement. The project will come online in phases this year and next, enabling us to realize investment tax credits and recover our investment by 2015. As we work on these renewable investments and related generation, we are being very careful to make certain we engage in investments that protect our credit ratings and improve our near-term cash flows.
Separately, Exelon Generation made investments in several transmission projects. We are seeing reduced congestion as a result around our Midwest nuclear plants as a result of these projects. They are very good example of small things that have very positive leverage in terms of our value.
As you all know, 2011 was a very active year in the regulatory and legislative arena. PECO fully transitioned to market rates at the beginning of the year and continues to pursue its investment leaders. ComEd received a rate case order in May and worked on passage of its infrastructure legislation. The latter allows ComEd to implement a formula rate and will spur significant infrastructure investment in the electric, including over $230 million in 2012. 
Exelon through Joe Dominguez, was a key player in the successful initiative to open the Ohio market to competition. FERC approved a formula rate filing so-called RITE line. We are closely monitoring the NRC's response to the Fukushima event. So far the NRC has taken a thoughtful and measured approach to respond to this, and our nuclear organization is actively engaged in applying the lessons learned.
EPA issued its final Air Toxics Rule in December, which will lead to the retirement of the older and more inefficient coal plants. The final rule is largely as we expected and provides flexibility in the timeline for those plants that will be working to comply. And from Exelon's point of view, the key thing is that people shut down those plants intend to shut down. We expect that the toxics rule will be implemented on time beginning in 2015.
Unfortunately, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted a stay on the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which was both to go to effect on January 1. Our lawyers have reviewed it. We believe the EPA was put in his authority and the court will ultimately uphold the rule in large part. But although the state is a setback, we believe that the Air Toxics Rule is the more important one in terms of driving plant retirements. We do not believe the stay will have a significant effect on the number of coal plant retirements to take place, and so far what we're seeing is just with our expectations. Ken Cornew will address that more later.
Now it's fitting given the gas markets that our operator today is named Cassandra, because there have been a whole lot of good news in the gas markets lately, so we have Cornew to talk about it. It is no secret that our prices have declined since our last earnings call and that natural gas prices are the key driver. Spot natural gas prices have fallen more than 15% since the beginning of the year, partly due to the continued news about shale gas development, but also very much new to the mild temperatures that we have seen so far this year. 
Energy prices have followed gas prices even more closely than usual and have reacted negatively to the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in late December. Thus, we have given back the gains we saw in July when the rule is finalized. Power Team continues to believe that the reaction to the gas prices and the stay is overdone, and we expect some near-term price recovery. Jen will talk about all of this in more detail in a few minutes and will also address how we're responding to the situation.
Our merger with Constellation remains on track to close in the first quarter. We have received several more of the required approvals for the transaction, in particularly the all-important DOJ review, and we await final approvals by Maryland, the SC, the NRC and FERC. In Maryland, we were of course extremely pleased to have settled with a number of major parties to the case, including the Governor, very much including the Governor, and we have now a schedule for final order from the PSC on February 17. We have asked the FERC to issue their final ruling early this year and remain hopeful that they will provide their final decision in the same timeframe as the Maryland Commission. We will close the merger shortly after receiving all of the regulatory approvals.
Now just before I turn this over to Matt. 2011 was really a very good year for Exelon. Every part of the company contributed to making it a good year. And while we don't like the current state of the power markets at all, I am absolutely convinced that we will find ways to keep beating what the computer says this all means. And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

This morning I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full-year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presentat",794,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full-year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presentation includes a significant amount of information regarding this quarter's results. We'll start by highlighting a few key items shown on Slide 7. 
Exelon closed out 2011 by delivering fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.82 per share and $4.16 per share for the full year, which includes $0.07 of unfavorable weather versus the prior year. We are pleased with our 2011 financial and operating performance, and as John discussed, our operating companies contributed significantly to these results.
Moving to Slide 8. Generation contributed $0.54 per share to the fourth quarter operating results and $3.01 per share for the year. Generation's fourth quarter results reflect favorable market conditions of $0.06 per share, which is primarily driven by net favorability for the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and hydro production. 
Now moving to ComEd on Slide 9. ComEd delivered operating earnings of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.61 per share for the full year, resulting in an annual earned ROE of 9.3%. ComEd's fourth quarter results included $0.06 per share benefit per the revenue requirement reconciliation and the establishment of a regulatory asset for storm costs related to the implementation of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act passed earlier this fall. The infrastructure legislation provides a reliable mechanism for the recovery of the $2.6 billion capital expenditures ComEd will make to modernize and upgrade the system over the next 10 years beginning in 2012. 
As required by the legislation, the Illinois Power Agency will conduct the procurement option in February of this year or around-the-clock energy contracts for June 2013 to December 2017. The bids are due on February 10, and the Illinois Commerce Commission decision is scheduled for February 17.
Moving to PECO on Slide 10. PECO contributed $0.11 per share to the consolidated fourth quarter operating results and $0.58 per share for the year, resulting in an annual rate making ROE of approximately 11%. The PECO region encountered its share of weather-related challenges in 2011, including Hurricane Irene in the third quarter and a surprise snowstorm in late October. PECO's fourth quarter results were impacted by 20% fewer than normal heating degree days as a result of the unseasonably warm temperatures. In total, unfavorable weather cost PECO $0.05 per share for the year versus prior year.
With respect to load, ComEd and PECO's load trends detail are included in the appendix of today's presentation. For 2011, ComEd's total weather-normal load declined by 0.5% compared to 2010, in line with our third quarter projection. PECO's weather-normal total load declined by 0.9% for the year versus the projected 0.5% decline. 
In 2012, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2011 results, with only a small decline of 0.2% on a weather-normal basis. This is not a surprising projection given that many of the economic forecasts that impacts ComEd load are expected to mimic 2011, including gross natural product, unemployment, housing starts and energy efficiency expansion. 
For PECO, as a result of the ramp down of the 2 oil refineries and the third expected by July 2012, plus weak economic conditions and energy efficiency programs, total electric deliveries are expected to decline by 5.4% compared to 2011 weather-normal results. Absent the oil refinery impacts, PECO's 2012 load forecast will only be down approximately 1.8% compared to 2011.
On Slide 11, you can see that we generated approximately $5 billion of cash from operations for 2011. ExGen whole coast credit rating is strong, ending the year with FFO to debt ratio of 52%, well above our target range of 30% to 35%. 
With respect to our merger with Constellation, we have concluded our post-merger legal structure and now plan to merge Constellation Energy Company in the Exelon Corporation and then transfer all of the Constellation Energy Company subsidiaries, excluding BGE, to Exelon Generation. Constellation Energy Company's existing debt to be assumed by Exelon Corp. and BGE would continue to exist as a separate subsidiary under Exelon.  We expect to execute the structure reorganization immediately following the closing of the merger, and both companies have received the necessary bank consents to proceed.
As John mentioned, given the status of the merger, we will defer providing earnings guidance for 2012 until after we close. At our Analyst Day, we'll provide consolidated earnings guidance for 2012, including our expected pension expense and contributions, and we will discuss the combined companies' strategic business objectives going forward. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it over to Ken Cornew for a discussion on power markets and hedging."
296181,145603697,210559,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to say it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend a few minut",928,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to say it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend a few minutes this morning going over what we've witnessed recently in the gas and power markets, and let me start with the gas markets. Natural gas prices have continued to move lower on strong production and an unprecedented lack of winter weather. We main growth and general on economic growth are adding to the downward pressure. These factors are resulting in significant gas storage inventory that will persist with continued mild weather, which would be a drag on the gas prices through 2012 and potentially through 2013. 
As of September 30, 2011, and end of the year 2013 and '14 natural gas prices dropped by approximately $0.80. And as John mentioned, over the first 3 weeks of their, prices have fallen almost another $0.30 and prompt gas these levels last seen in January 2002.
Longer-term, in the 2014 and 2016 time period, we expect natural gas prices in the $4 to $6 range, which we believe is supported with the long run margin of production. It will be dependent on a reasonable levels of gas demand growth, some of which we expect to come from will plant retirements and the expected resulting increase in natural gas generation as a replacement of power. For discipline this but it will be a key part of the longer-term response to lower gas prices. We saw an announcement earlier this week of a shift from dry gas to more liquids-rich plays, and we would expect that will continue. 
What's been more surprising to us over the last several weeks is the response to these lower gas prices in the power markets. We continue to believe that the Mercury and Air Toxics standards en masse will have a significant impact on coal generation economics, causing the retirement of old and inefficient and plants. We updated our modeling of mass to reflect both the recent drop in gas prices and to finalize rules and believe it's impact on
power 
prices in 2015 timeframe to be in the $3 to $5 range. This price impact is due to a combination of coal retirements and their effect on the existing new generation status, as well as higher dispatch cost per newly retrofitted units. Given the recent decrease in market power 
prices, our modeling is suggesting little to no impact of mass is price into the current NiHub and West Hub market prices. While we expect our prices to decrease and let me explain why, while we expect our prices to decrease under a falling gas environment, we would actually expect heat rates to expand and not fall. For example, looking back to September 30 prices, we felt that the market was incorporating a significant portion of the mass regulation. NiHub in 2016 market prices was approximately $44 a megawatt hour, and gas was a $5.60 mmbtu few heat rate of 7.8. As of January 4, gas prices had fallen to $4.90. Our internal modeling which reflects mass regulation suggest that heat rates should have increased to approximately 8.5. However, actual power prices were close to $36 implying a market heat rate of under 7.5. This reduced heat rate indicate that the market is currently undervalued by at least $5 a megawatt. 
Some of the weakness in the forward heat rates could be attributed to a potential lack of liquidity, the state of Cross-state Air Pollutant Rule and early selling pressure. I should point out that this assessment changes every day based on movements in gas and power prices. So how are we responding? 
First, it's important to note that our ratable hedging strategy has largely inflated us from the effects in 2012. We started to hedge 2012 when prices were significantly higher. We entered the year over 90% hedged in PJM for 2012, limiting the impact on our revenue fueled in the near term. For 2013, as indicated in the December 31 hedge disclosure, we were neither ratable hedge levels of 61% to 64%. Going forward, we expect to remain near our ratable hedging level. We have kept considerable lengths portfolio in both 2012 and 2013 based on tightening reserve margins in the ERCOT market and attractive sports on peak hours, which we can capture with our peaking generation capacity in that market as we did in 2011.
In 2014 and '15, we still have a significant open position. We ultimately expect energy prices to adjust to fully reflect the benefits of environmental regulations. In the meantime, we are using more options, which was a decline in market prices could take us above our ratable hedge levels. This will continue to protect us from further move down in gas price while still eating upside for power prices to return to levels more in line with our fundamental views. As of now, our hedge percentages for 2013 and '14 include approximately 7% and 10% from put options, respectively. While we continue to remain disciplined in our hedging approach, we will also continue to be strategic and we will take advantage of the upside in the market based on our fundamental views. We will accomplish this for use of put options, participation in various utility solicitations, leveraging our retail channel and carefully choosing the location of our sales. This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

I believe there was some significant selling going on with the fear is that the gas market was going to continue to decline. I do think the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule had an immediate impact on forward prior power prices.

And we'll obviously take our most recent use of gas and power markets into account.

And the beauty of these projects is the ability to stop, slow stop or slow or accelerate as we see and not be stuck with a lot -- some capital that makes us finished a project that may become uneconomic.

We have the Peach Bottom project proceeding on, we're in the early stages of the Limerick and de La Salle project. We continue to watch them closely. They still have a positive, they still meet the positive hurdle rates that we required them to.

Exelon is a great company and with the Constellation and with Chris's leadership, it's going to be and even greater company. The only thing that could make me happier would be if power prices and earnings forecasts were back where they were in 7 and 8. That would make me happier because it would make you happier and make all of us richer, and that's the objective I've had in mind for all 28 years. But even though these aren't the best of times or Exelon, I'm still very proud that we have run this for our investors and we've tried to do what you suggested and give you straight numbers as soon as we know what they might be.
And as I look at the situation, yes, I love it when Exelon was 40% bigger than Southern, and I don't like seeing Southern and Duke and Dominion having more market cap than us right now. But the point I would like to make is the fully regulated integrate are on the top of the curve, and we are right now in the trench. Things in '08 were too good for us to be true forever. Things right now won't be forever either, and while you wait for better times to come at Exelon, you can know that Chris will be working like hell to beat the computer projections. You know that we have us good a management team to do that as anybody in the industry, and you know that we have a very good dividend to sustain you in the meanwhile.
colleagues to go back and try to come up with one capsule of what we have done for you during my years with ComEd and Exelon. And during my tenure, your TSR was 295%, that's more than 10% compounded through last week. And that beats both the S&P 500, which was only 4% for that period of it and the utility index has a little over 7% for the same period. And I say that when we're in the trough. Exelon will be back, I have a high level of confidence, and the people around me are those who will make it so. 
As Chart 15 suggests, there are a bunch of things that I am very, very proud of, none of which I did all by myself, some of which I made a large contribution to, some of which I mostly stayed out of the way for. But those include the merger that created Exelon and the one we're now doing with Constellation. It includes the sale of ComEd fossil plants and putting generation into a separate market-based business. It improves -- it includes solving the reliability problems at ComEd, and we're going to help bring better service to Baltimore too. improve keeping our word in Pennsylvania when we did the merger there. I had a leading Pennsylvania public official site you're almost the only people whoever kept all their commitments in the acquiring jurisdiction. That's really important, because in this business they always know where to find you. I'm giving everyone Chris his home number, Amy is very grateful. And if you don't keep the commitments, you don't have a very good feel to play on for the next time. One of the reasons we have been successful with Governor in working out a deal is that people like Governor Rendell and their daily said when these guys give their word, they keep it. And it's very important and we will keep our word in Maryland just like we have in Pennsylvania and in Illinois, and just like we have for you. I devoutly wish that I could leave you at a time when we have a higher stock price, but we have kept our words, we have focused entirely on what is good for our investors, and we have delivered over a very long time.

It's always a shame to waste someone as talented as Stacie reading the Safe Harbor language, but the lawyers keep saying, she has to do it. 2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating perfor",1616,"Good morning, everybody. It's always a shame to waste someone as talented as Stacie reading the Safe Harbor language, but the lawyers keep saying, she has to do it. 
2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating performance; we grew the company through acquisitions, which are working on both on an earnings and cash flow basis; we made progress on a range of regulatory, legislative and market issues; and we are getting ever closer to consummating our merger with Constellation.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.82 per share. While December was a little disappointing due mostly to weather, our full year 2011 operating earnings per share of $4.16 were within our final guidance range, better than our 2010 results and well above our original expectations for the year. Our leading drivers in '11 were the strong performance of the generation fleet, led, of course, by our ninth consecutive year of over 93% capacity factors in nuclear that's helped significantly by our Texas operations. Tax benefits helped us a great deal. The impact of the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act was positive, as was our summer weather. The good news was partially offset by costly storms at both ComEd and PECO and lower than weather-normalized load at PECO. ComEd had a terrible July storm wise, which we soaked up successfully, and PECO had both a hurricane and a freak fall snowstorm. 
Matt will review the quarter-over-quarter and full year financial drivers in more detail. As you know, we made a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension at the beginning of the year, which along with Doug Brown's fine work on asset allocation, allowed us to end the year at 83% funded status. And remember, this is with very low discount rates. The contribution gives us added cushion in our FFO-to-debt credit metrics and will help us see the company through the current trough and power crisis. 
We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends. We are keenly aware that to all of you, the dividend is an absolutely critical part of our value proposition. It's what makes it possible for you to hold on with us while we work our way through the gas and power price trough. Our cash flows and credit metrics support our dividend and capital programs even as we accept a higher payout ratio. Chris Crane, who will answer most of the questions today about future performance, believes, as I do, in the continued importance to the dividend. Simply put, we get it. And he is as committed as I am to maintaining it.
As we have mentioned previously, given our pending merger with Constellation, we are not providing full year Exelon standalone guidance for 2012 on today's call. We will provide combined company guidance at an analyst day that we expect to hold after -- in the spring after the merger closes.
Turning to our operating results, I simply have to recognize Chip Pardee, Mike Pacilio, Susan Landahl and their team for Nuclear's fine year. Their capacity factor was 93.3% for 2011. As I said earlier, that is the ninth consecutive year they had beaten 93%. This is just a tremendous performance. They continue to renew their commitment. They continue to sharpen their edge. We are very, very proud of what our nuclear folks are doing. Exelon continues to be a leader in U.S. and other operations as we must be. 
Both ComEd and PECO faced significant storms in 2011. PECO's response to very large storms was absolutely best I've ever seen and far better than most of the other Northeastern utilities, many of which found themselves in more than a little trouble. Despite its summer storms, ComEd's outage frequency statistics were the best on record. Both delivery companies keep getting better.
Our power fleet in Texas, led by Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg, was very helpful to our earnings in both the first and the third quarters. Beyond the merger with Constellation, which is, of course, our major strategic endeavor, and I will cover a little later, we added significantly to our generation fleet in 2011. Our Exelon Wind business and the addition of the Wolf Hollow combined-cycle gas turbine in ERCOT added more than $40 million in earnings in 2011.
Exelon Nuclear added 138 megawatts of clean and profitable energy to our power upgrade program in 2011. In September, we added 230 megawatts of solar generation to our clean energy development pipeline with the acquisition of Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, to be funded in part through a DOE loan guarantee and backed by long-term power purchase agreement. The project will come online in phases this year and next, enabling us to realize investment tax credits and recover our investment by 2015. As we work on these renewable investments and related generation, we are being very careful to make certain we engage in investments that protect our credit ratings and improve our near-term cash flows.
Separately, Exelon Generation made investments in several transmission projects. We are seeing reduced congestion as a result around our Midwest nuclear plants as a result of these projects. They are very good example of small things that have very positive leverage in terms of our value.
As you all know, 2011 was a very active year in the regulatory and legislative arena. PECO fully transitioned to market rates at the beginning of the year and continues to pursue its investment in smart meters. ComEd received a rate case order in May and worked on passage of its infrastructure legislation. The latter allows ComEd to implement a formula rate and will spur significant infrastructure investment in the electric grid, including over $230 million in 2012. 
Exelon, through Joe Dominguez, was a key player in the successful initiative to open the Ohio market to competition. FERC approved a formula rate filing for the so-called RITE line. We are closely monitoring the NRC's response to the Fukushima event. So far, the NRC has taken a thoughtful and measured approach to responding to this, and our nuclear organization is actively engaged in applying the lessons learned.
EPA issued its final Air Toxics Rule in December, which will lead to the retirement of the older and more inefficient coal plants. The final rule is largely as we expected and provides flexibility in the timeline for those plants that will be working to comply. And from Exelon's point of view, the key thing is that people shut down those plants they intend to shut down. We expect that the toxics rule will be implemented on time beginning in 2015.
Unfortunately, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted a stay on the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which was supposed to go into effect on January 1. Our lawyers have reviewed it. We believe the EPA was put in its authority, and the court will ultimately uphold the rule in large part. But although the stay is a setback, we believe that the Air Toxics Rule is the more important one in terms of driving plant retirements. We do not believe the stay will have a significant effect on the number of coal plant retirements to take place. And so far, what we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. Ken Cornew will address that more later.
Now it's fitting given the gas markets that our operator today is named Cassandra, because there have been a whole lot of good news in the gas markets lately, so we have a cheerful fellow, named Cornew, to talk about it. It is no secret that our prices have declined since our last earnings call and that natural gas prices are the key driver. Spot natural gas prices have fallen more than 15% since the beginning of the year, partly due to the continued news about shale gas development, but also very much due to the mild temperatures that we have seen so far this winter. 
Energy prices have followed gas prices even more closely than usual and have reacted negatively to the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in late December. Thus, we have given back the gains we saw in July when the rule was finalized. Power Team continues to believe that the reaction to the gas prices and the stay is overdone, and we expect some near-term price recovery. Ken will talk about all of this in more detail in a few minutes and will also address how we're responding to the situation. 
Our merger with Constellation remains on track to close in the first quarter. We have received several more of the required approvals for the transaction, in particularly the all-important DOJ review, and we await final approvals by Maryland, the SC, the NRC and FERC. In Maryland, we were, of course, extremely pleased to have settled with a number of major parties to the case, including the Governor -- very much including the Governor, and we have now a schedule for final order from the PSC on February 17. We have asked the FERC to issue their final ruling early this year and remain hopeful that they will provide their final decision in the same timeframe as the Maryland Commission. We will close the merger shortly after receiving all of the regulatory approvals.
Now just before I turn this over to Matt, 2011 was really a very good year for Exelon. Every part of the company contributed to making it a good year. And while we don't like the current state of the power markets at all, I am absolutely convinced that we will find ways to keep beating what the computer says this all means. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead.

This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presentation includes a significant amount of information regarding this quarter's results. We'll start by highlighting a few key items shown on Slide 7. 
Exelon closed out 2011 by delivering fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.82 per share and $4.16 per share for the full year, which includes $0.07 of unfavorable weather versus the prior year. We are pleased with our 2011 financial and operating performance and, as John discussed, our operating companies contributed significantly to these results.
Moving to Slide 8, Generation contributed $0.54 per share to the fourth quarter operating results and $3.01 per share for the year. Generation's fourth quarter results reflect favorable market conditions of $0.06 per share, which is primarily driven by net favorability for the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and hydro production. 
Now moving to ComEd on Slide 9, ComEd delivered operating earnings of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.61 per share for the full year, resulting in an annual earned ROE of 9.3%. ComEd's fourth quarter results included $0.06 per share benefit for the revenue requirement reconciliation and the establishment of a regulatory asset for storm costs related to the implementation of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act passed earlier this fall. The infrastructure legislation provides a reliable mechanism for the recovery of the $2.6 billion capital expenditures ComEd will make to modernize and upgrade the system over the next 10 years beginning in 2012. 
As required by the legislation, the Illinois Power Agency will conduct a procurement auction in February of this year or around-the-clock energy contracts for June 2013 to December 2017. The bids are due on February 10, and the Illinois Commerce Commission decision is scheduled for February 17.
Moving to PECO on Slide 10, PECO contributed $0.11 per share to the consolidated fourth quarter operating results and $0.58 per share for the year, resulting in an annual rate-making ROE of approximately 11%. The PECO region encountered its share of weather-related challenges in 2011, including Hurricane Irene in the third quarter and the surprise snowstorm in late October. PECO's fourth quarter results were impacted by 20% fewer-than-normal heating degree days as a result of the unseasonably warm temperatures. In total, unfavorable weather cost PECO $0.05 per share for the year versus the prior year.
With respect to load, ComEd and PECO's load trends details are included on -- in the appendix of today's presentation. For 2011, ComEd's total weather-normal load declined by 0.5% compared to 2010, in line with our third quarter projection. PECO's weather-normal total load declined by 0.9% for the year versus the projected 0.5% decline. 
In 2012, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2011 results, with only a small decline of 0.2% on a weather-normal basis. This is not a surprising projection given that many of the economic forecasts that impacts ComEd's load are expected to mimic 2011, including gross metro product, unemployment, housing starts and energy efficiency expansion. 
For PECO, as a result of the ramp down of the 2 oil refineries and the third expected by July 2012, plus weak economic conditions and energy efficiency programs, total electric deliveries are expected to decline by 5.4% compared to 2011 weather-normal results. Absent the oil refinery impacts, PECO's 2012 load forecast would only be down approximately 1.8% compared to 2011.
On Slide 11, you can see that we generated approximately $5 billion of cash from operations for 2011. ExGen HoCo's credit ratings are strong, ending the year with FFO-to-debt ratio of 52%, well above our target range of 30% to 35%. 
With respect to our merger with Constellation, we have concluded our post-merger legal structure and now plan to merge Constellation Energy Company in the Exelon Corporation, and then transfer all of the Constellation Energy Company subsidiaries, excluding BGE, to Exelon Generation. Constellation Energy Company's existing debt will be assumed by Exelon Corp. and BGE will continue to exist as a separate subsidiary under Exelon. We expect to execute the structure reorganization immediately following the closing of the merger, and both companies have received the necessary bank consents to proceed.
As John mentioned, given the status of the merger, we will defer providing earnings guidance for 2012 until after we close. At our analyst day, we will provide consolidated earnings guidance for 2012, including our expected pension expense and contributions, and we will discuss the combined companies' strategic business objectives going forward. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it over to Ken Cornew for the discussion on power markets and hedging."
296181,145603697,210686,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend",953,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend a few minutes this morning going over what we've witnessed recently in the gas and power markets, and let me start with the gas markets. 
Natural gas prices have continued to move lower on strong production and on unprecedented lack of winter weather. We estimating growth and general bearishness on economic growth are adding to the downward pressure. These factors are resulting in significant gas storage inventories that would persist with continued mild weather, which would be a drag on gas prices through 2012 and potentially into 2013. 
As we -- September 30, 2011 and the end of the year, 2013 and '14 natural gas prices dropped by approximately $0.80. And as John mentioned, over the first 3 weeks of the year, prices have fallen almost another $0.30 and prompt month gas has hit levels last seen in January 2002.
Longer term, in the 2014 and 2016 time period, we expect natural gas prices in the $4 to $6 range, which we believe is supported by the long-run margin on cost of production. This will be dependent on reasonable levels of gas demand growth, some of which we expect to come from coal plant retirements and the expected resulting increase in natural gas generation as a replacement source of power. Producer discipline will need to be a key part of the longer-term response to lower gas prices. We saw one announcement earlier this week of a shift from dry gas to more liquids-rich plays, and we would expect that will continue. 
What's been more surprising to us over the last several weeks is the over response to these lower gas prices in the power markets. We continue to believe that the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards or MATS will have a significant impact on coal generation economics, causing the retirement of old inefficient and unscrubbed plants. We've updated our modeling of MATS to reflect both the recent drop in gas prices and the finalized rule and believe its impact on power prices into 2015 timeframe to be in the $3 to $5 range at West Hub and NiHub. This price impact is due to a combination of coal retirements and their effect on the existing generation stack, as well as higher dispatch cost for newly retrofitted units. 
Given the recent decrease in market power prices, our modeling is suggesting that little to no impact of MATS is priced into the current NiHub and West Hub market prices. While we expect power prices to decrease -- and let me explain why. While we expect power prices to decrease under a falling gas environment, we would actually expect heat rates to expand and not fall. For example, looking back to September 30 prices, we felt that the market was incorporating a significant portion of the mass regulations. NiHub's 2016 market prices was approximately $44 a megawatt hour, and gas was at $5.60 in MMbtu, implying a market heat rate of 7.8. 
As of January 4, gas prices had fallen to $4.90. Our internal modeling, which reflects mass regulations, suggest that heat rates should have increased to approximately 8.5. However, actual power prices were close to $36, implying a market heat rate of under 7.5. This reduced heat rate indicates that the market is currently undervalued by at least $5 a megawatt. 
Some of the weakness in the forward heat rates could be attributed to a potential lack of liquidity, the stay of Cross-State Air Pollutant Rule and early selling pressure. I should point out that this assessment changes every day based on movements in gas and power prices. So how are we responding? 
First, it's important to note that our ratable hedging strategy has largely inflated us from the effects in 2012. We started to hedge 2012 when PJM prices were significantly higher. We entered the year over 90% hedged in PJM for 2012, limiting the impact on our revenue net fuel in the near term. 
For 2013, as indicated in the December 31 hedge disclosure, we were near ratable hedge levels of 61% to 64%. Going forward, we expect to remain near our ratable hedging level. We have kept considerable length in the south portfolio in both 2012 and 2013 based on tightening reserve margins in the ERCOT market and attractive spot spreads in the on-peak hours, which we can capture with our peaking generation capacity in that market as we did in 2011.
In 2014 and '15, we still have a significant open position. We ultimately expect energy prices to adjust to fully reflect the benefits of environmental regulations. In the meantime, we are using more put options, which with a decline in market prices could take us above our ratable hedge levels. This will continue to protect us from further move down in gas price, while still leaving upside for power prices to return to levels more in line with our fundamental views. 
As of now, our hedge percentages for 2013 and '14 include approximately 7% and 10% from put options, respectively. While we continue to remain disciplined in our hedging approach, we will also continue to be strategic in order to take advantage of upside in the market based on our fundamental views. We will accomplish this for use of put options, participation in various utility solicitations, leveraging our retail channel and carefully choosing the location of our sales. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

I believe there is -- there was some significant selling going on with -- the fear is that the gas market was going to continue to decline. I do think the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule had an immediate impact on forward power prices. So when you lump all these things together, you saw a lot of barrier sentiment in the market. Although some of that has recovered in the past week or so, I still see when I study spot market prices, spot market heat rates, when we look at our modeling, as I described in my commentary, I still see upside -- significant upside in the -- in heat rates based on the real fundamental factors that should be driving the market."

It's a calibration method, allows us to get a few percent out of multiple units. The second bucket was on component replacement with new engineer standards, turbines, generators, more efficiency, and those projects are halfway through and are needed for plant life extension, but they also pay for themselves nicely with the returns on the more efficient components. And the third and the final bucket is most costly are the EPUs, the extended power uprates. They're at 3 facilities, LaSalle, in Illinois, Peach Bottom and Limerick. We continue to watch those closely. We have the Peach Bottom project proceeding on. We're in the early stages of the Limerick and the LaSalle project. We continue to watch them closely. They still have a positive -- they still meet the positive hurdle rates that we require them to. But the optionality around though is if we see the NiHub market can't support, for instance, we could stop the LaSalle project without any ramifications on maybe a stronger market in PJM West Hub or the East for Peach and Limerick. So that kinds of describes the optionality."

As Steve Fleishman suggested, this I expect to be my last earnings call as CEO. And that's after 28 years of trying to be useful to all of you and to customers, all the way from little Skowhegan in Maine to here in Chicago. Obviously, I'm absolutely delighted to be able to end a very long career with what I hope and expect to be the completion of the Constellation acquisition. Exelon is a great company, and with Constellation and with Chris' leadership, it's going to be an even greater company. The only thing that could make me happier would be if power prices and earnings forecasts were back where they were in'07 and '08. That would make me happier because it would make you happier and make all of us richer. And that's the objective I've had in mind for all 28 years. But even though these aren't the best of times for Exelon, I'm still very proud that we have run this for our investors, and we've tried to do what Hugh Wynne suggested and give you straight numbers as soon as we know what they might be. And as I look at the situation, yes, I loved it when Exelon was 40% bigger than Southern, and I don't like seeing Southern and Duke and Dominion having more market cap than us right now. But the point I would like to make is before we regulate it, integrates are on the top of the curve, and we're right now in the trench. Things in '08 were too good for us to be true forever. Things right now won't be forever either. And while you wait for better times to come at Exelon, you can know that Chris will be working like hell to beat the computer projections. You know that we have as good a management team to do that as anybody in the industry, and you know that we have a very good dividend to sustain you in the meanwhile. But I did ask my colleagues to go back and try to come up with one capsule of what we have done for you during my years with ComEd and Exelon. And during my tenure, your TSR was 295%, that's more than 10% compounded through last week. And that beats both the S&P 500, which was only 4% for that period compounded, and the utility index has a little over 7% for the same period. And I say that when we're in the trough. Exelon will be back, I have a high level of confidence, and the people around me are those who will make it so. As Chart 15 suggests, there are a bunch of things that I am very, very proud of, none of which I did all by myself, some of which I made a large contribution to, some of which I mostly stayed out of the way for. But those include the merger that created Exelon and the one we're now doing with Constellation. It includes the sale of ComEd's fossil plants and putting Generation into a separate market-based business. It improves -- includes solving the reliability problems at ComEd, and we're going to help bring better service to Baltimore, too. It improved ""keeping our word in Pennsylvania"" when we did the merger there. I had a leading Pennsylvania public official say, ""You're almost the only people whoever kept all their commitments in the acquiring jurisdiction."" That's really important because in this business, they always know where to find you. I'm giving everyone Chris' home number, and he is very grateful. And if you don't keep the commitments, you don't have a very good field to play on for the next time. And one of the reasons we have been successful with Governor O'Malley in working out a deal is that people like Governor Rendell and Mayor Daley said, ""When these guys give their word, they keep it."" And it's very important, and we will keep our word in Maryland just like we have in Pennsylvania and in Illinois, and just like we have for you. I devoutly wish that I could leave you at a time when we have a higher stock price, but we have kept our words. We have focused entirely on what is good for our investors, and we have delivered over a very long time. We shall do so again. Thank you very much."

It's always a shame to waste someone as talented as Stacie reading the Safe Harbor language, but the lawyers keep saying, she has to do it. 2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating perfor",1616,"Good morning, everybody. It's always a shame to waste someone as talented as Stacie reading the Safe Harbor language, but the lawyers keep saying, she has to do it. 
2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating performance; we grew the company through acquisitions, which are working on both on an earnings and cash flow basis; we made progress on a range of regulatory, legislative and market issues; and we are getting ever closer to consummating our merger with Constellation.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.82 per share. While December was a little disappointing due mostly to weather, our full year 2011 operating earnings per share of $4.16 were within our final guidance range, better than our 2010 results and well above our original expectations for the year. Our leading drivers in '11 were the strong performance of the generation fleet, led, of course, by our ninth consecutive year of over 93% capacity factors in nuclear that's helped significantly by our Texas operations. Tax benefits helped us a great deal. The impact of the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act was positive, as was our summer weather. The good news was partially offset by costly storms at both ComEd and PECO and lower than weather-normalized load at PECO. ComEd had a terrible July storm wise, which we soaked up successfully, and PECO had both a hurricane and a freak fall snowstorm. 
Matt will review the quarter-over-quarter and full year financial drivers in more detail. As you know, we made a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension at the beginning of the year, which along with Doug Brown's fine work on asset allocation, allowed us to end the year at 83% funded status. And remember, this is with very low discount rates. The contribution gives us added cushion in our FFO-to-debt credit metrics and will help us see the company through the current trough and power crisis. 
We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends. We are keenly aware that to all of you, the dividend is an absolutely critical part of our value proposition. It's what makes it possible for you to hold on with us while we work our way through the gas and power price trough. Our cash flows and credit metrics support our dividend and capital programs even as we accept a higher payout ratio. Chris Crane, who will answer most of the questions today about future performance, believes, as I do, in the continued importance to the dividend. Simply put, we get it. And he is as committed as I am to maintaining it.
As we have mentioned previously, given our pending merger with Constellation, we are not providing full year Exelon stand-alone guidance for 2012 on today's call. We will provide combined company guidance at an analyst day that we expect to hold after -- in the spring after the merger closes.
Turning to our operating results, I simply have to recognize Chip Pardee, Mike Pacilio, Susan Landahl and their team for Nuclear's fine year. Their capacity factor was 93.3% for 2011. As I said earlier, that is the ninth consecutive year they have beaten 93%. This is just a tremendous performance. They continue to renew their commitment. They continue to sharpen their edge. We are very, very proud of what our nuclear folks are doing. Exelon continues to be a leader in U.S. nuclear operations as we must be. 
Both ComEd and PECO faced significant storms in 2011. PECO's response to very large storms was absolutely best I've ever seen and far better than most of the other Northeastern utilities, many of which found themselves in more than a little trouble. Despite its summer storms, ComEd's outage frequency statistics were the best on record. Both delivery companies keep getting better.
Our power fleet in Texas, led by Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg, was very helpful to our earnings in both the first and the third quarters. Beyond the merger with Constellation, which is, of course, our major strategic endeavor, and I will cover a little later, we added significantly to our generation fleet in 2011. Our Exelon Wind business and the addition of the Wolf Hollow combined-cycle gas turbine in ERCOT added more than $40 million in earnings in 2011.
Exelon Nuclear added 138 megawatts of clean and profitable energy to our power upgrade program in 2011. In September, we added 230 megawatts of solar generation to our clean energy development pipeline with the acquisition of Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, to be funded in part through a DOE loan guarantee and backed by long-term power purchase agreement. The project will come online in phases this year and next, enabling us to realize investment tax credits and recover our investment by 2015. As we work on these renewable investments and related generation, we are being very careful to make certain we engage in investments that protect our credit ratings and improve our near-term cash flows.
Separately, Exelon Generation made investments in several transmission projects. We are seeing reduced congestion as a result around our Midwest nuclear plants as a result of these projects. They're a very good example of small things that have very positive leverage in terms of our value.
As you all know, 2011 was a very active year in the regulatory and legislative arena. PECO fully transitioned to market rates at the beginning of the year and continues to pursue its investment in smart meters. ComEd received a rate case order in May and worked on passage of its infrastructure legislation. The latter allows ComEd to implement a formula rate and will spur significant infrastructure investment in the electric grid, including over $230 million in 2012. 
Exelon, through Joe Dominguez, was a key player in the successful initiative to open the Ohio market to competition. FERC approved a formula rate filing for the so-called RITE line. We are closely monitoring the NRC's response to the Fukushima event. So far, the NRC has taken a thoughtful and measured approach to responding to this, and our nuclear organization is actively engaged in applying the lessons learned.
EPA issued its final Air Toxics Rule in December, which will lead to the retirement of the older and more inefficient coal plants. The final rule is largely as we expected and provides flexibility in the time line for those plants that will be working to comply. And from Exelon's point of view, the key thing is that people shut down those plants they intend to shut down. We expect that the toxics rule will be implemented on time beginning in 2015.
Unfortunately, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted a stay on the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which was supposed to go into effect on January 1. Our lawyers have reviewed it. We believe the EPA was within its authority, and the court will ultimately uphold the rule in large part. But although the stay is a setback, we believe that the Air Toxics Rule is the more important one in terms of driving plant retirements. We do not believe the stay will have a significant effect on the number of coal plant retirements to take place. And so far, what we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. Ken Cornew will address that more later.
Now it's fitting given the gas markets that our operator today is named Cassandra, because there hasn't been a whole lot of good news in the gas markets lately, so we have a cheerful fellow, named Cornew, to talk about it. It is no secret that our prices have declined since our last earnings call and that natural gas prices are the key driver. Spot natural gas prices have fallen more than 15% since the beginning of the year, partly due to the continued news about shale gas development, but also very much due to the mild temperatures that we have seen so far this winter. 
Energy prices have followed gas prices even more closely than usual and have reacted negatively to the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in late December. Thus, we have given back the gains we saw in July when the rule was finalized. Power Team continues to believe that the reaction to the gas prices and the stay is overdone, and we expect some near-term price recovery. Ken will talk about all of this in more detail in a few minutes and will also address how we're responding to the situation. 
Our merger with Constellation remains on track to close in the first quarter. We have received several more of the required approvals for the transaction, in particularly the all-important DOJ review, and we await final approvals by Maryland, the SC, the NRC and FERC. In Maryland, we were, of course, extremely pleased to have settled with a number of major parties to the case, including the Governor -- very much including the Governor, and we have now a schedule for final order from the PSC on February 17. We have asked the FERC to issue their final ruling early this year and remain hopeful that they will provide their final decision in the same time frame as the Maryland Commission. We will close the merger shortly after receiving all of the regulatory approvals.
Now just before I turn this over to Matt, 2011 was really a very good year for Exelon. Every part of the company contributed to making it a good year. And while we don't like the current state of the power markets at all, I am absolutely convinced that we will find ways to keep beating what the computer says this all means. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead.

This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presentation includes a significant amount of information regarding this quarter's results. We'll start by highlighting a few key items shown on Slide 7. 
Exelon closed out 2011 by delivering fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.82 per share and $4.16 per share for the full year, which includes $0.07 of unfavorable weather versus the prior year. We are pleased with our 2011 financial and operating performance and, as John discussed, our operating companies contributed significantly to these results.
Moving to Slide 8, Generation contributed $0.54 per share to the fourth quarter operating results and $3.01 per share for the year. Generation's fourth quarter results reflect favorable market conditions of $0.06 per share, which is primarily driven by net favorability for the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and hydro production. 
Now moving to ComEd on Slide 9, ComEd delivered operating earnings of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.61 per share for the full year, resulting in an annual earned ROE of 9.3%. ComEd's fourth quarter results included $0.06 per share benefit for the revenue requirement reconciliation and the establishment of a regulatory asset for storm costs related to the implementation of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act passed earlier this fall. The infrastructure legislation provides a reliable mechanism for the recovery of the $2.6 billion capital expenditures ComEd will make to modernize and upgrade the system over the next 10 years beginning in 2012. 
As required by the legislation, the Illinois Power Agency will conduct a procurement auction in February of this year for around-the-clock energy contracts for June 2013 to December 2017. The bids are due on February 10, and the Illinois Commerce Commission decision is scheduled for February 17.
Moving to PECO on Slide 10, PECO contributed $0.11 per share to the consolidated fourth quarter operating results and $0.58 per share for the year, resulting in an annual rate-making ROE of approximately 11%. The PECO region encountered its share of weather-related challenges in 2011, including Hurricane Irene in the third quarter and the surprise snowstorm in late October. PECO's fourth quarter results were impacted by 20% fewer-than-normal heating degree days as a result of the unseasonably warm temperatures. In total, unfavorable weather cost PECO $0.05 per share for the year versus the prior year.
With respect to load, ComEd and PECO's load trends details are included on -- in the appendix of today's presentation. For 2011, ComEd's total weather-normal load declined by 0.5% compared to 2010, in line with our third quarter projection. PECO's weather-normal total load declined by 0.9% for the year versus the projected 0.5% decline. 
In 2012, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2011 results, with only a small decline of 0.2% on a weather-normal basis. This is not a surprising projection given that many of the economic forecasts that impacts ComEd's load are expected to mimic 2011, including gross metro product, unemployment, housing starts and energy efficiency expansion. 
For PECO, as a result of the ramp down of the 2 oil refineries and the third expected by July 2012, plus weak economic conditions and energy efficiency programs, total electric deliveries are expected to decline by 5.4% compared to 2011 weather-normal results. Absent the oil refinery impacts, PECO's 2012 load forecast would only be down approximately 1.8% compared to 2011.
On Slide 11, you can see that we generated approximately $5 billion of cash from operations for 2011. ExGen HoCo's credit ratings are strong, ending the year with FFO-to-debt ratio of 52%, well above our target range of 30% to 35%. 
With respect to our merger with Constellation, we have concluded our post-merger legal structure and now plan to merge Constellation Energy Company into Exelon Corporation, and then transfer all of the Constellation Energy Company subsidiaries, excluding BGE, to Exelon Generation. Constellation Energy Company's existing debt will be assumed by Exelon Corp. and BGE will continue to exist as a separate subsidiary under Exelon. We expect to execute the structure reorganization immediately following the closing of the merger, and both companies have received the necessary bank consents to proceed.
As John mentioned, given the status of the merger, we will defer providing earnings guidance for 2012 until after we close. At our Analyst Day, we will provide consolidated earnings guidance for 2012, including our expected pension expense and contributions, and we will discuss the combined companies' strategic business objectives going forward. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it over to Ken Cornew for the discussion on power markets and hedging."
296181,145603697,210770,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2012",2012-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend",953,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend a few minutes this morning going over what we've witnessed recently in the gas and power markets, and let me start with the gas market. 
Natural gas prices have continued to move lower on strong production and an unprecedented lack of winter weather. Weak estimated [ph] growth and general bearishness on economic growth are adding to the downward pressure. These factors are resulting in significant gas storage inventories that would persist with continued mild weather, which would be a drag on gas prices through 2012 and potentially into 2013. 
Between September 30, 2011 and the end of the year, 2013 and '14 natural gas prices dropped by approximately $0.80. And as John mentioned, over the first 3 weeks of the year, prices have fallen almost another $0.30 and prompt month gas has hit levels last seen in January 2002.
Longer term, in the 2014 and 2016 time period, we expect natural gas prices in the $4 to $6 range, which we believe is supported by the long-run margin on cost of production. This will be dependent on reasonable levels of gas demand growth, some of which we expect to come from coal plant retirements and the expected resulting increase in natural gas generation as a replacement source of power. Producer discipline will need to be a key part of the longer-term response to lower gas prices. We saw one announcement earlier this week of a shift from dry gas to more liquids-rich plays, and we would expect that will continue. 
What's been more surprising to us over the last several weeks is the over response to these lower gas prices in the power markets. We continue to believe that the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards or MATS will have a significant impact on coal generation economics, causing the retirement of old inefficient and unscrubbed plants. We've updated our modeling of MATS to reflect both the recent drop in gas prices and the finalized rule and believe its impact on power prices into 2015 time frame to be in the $3 to $5 range at West Hub and NiHub. This price impact is due to a combination of coal retirements and their effect on the existing generation stack, as well as higher dispatch cost for newly retrofitted units. 
Given the recent decrease in market power prices, our modeling is suggesting that little to no impact of MATS is priced into the current NiHub and West Hub market prices. While we expect power prices to decrease -- and let me explain why. While we expect power prices to decrease under a falling gas environment, we would actually expect heat rates to expand and not fall. For example, looking back to September 30 prices, we felt that the market was incorporating a significant portion of the mass regulations. NiHub's 2016 market prices was approximately $44 a megawatt hour, and gas was at $5.60 in MMbtu, implying a market heat rate of 7.8. 
As of January 4, gas prices had fallen to $4.90. Our internal modeling, which reflects mass regulations, suggest that heat rates should have increased to approximately 8.5. However, actual power prices were close to $36, implying a market heat rate of under 7.5. This reduced heat rate indicates that the market is currently undervalued by at least $5 a megawatt. 
Some of the weakness in the forward heat rates could be attributed to a potential lack of liquidity, the stay of Cross-State Air Pollutant Rule and early selling pressure. I should point out that this assessment changes every day based on movements in gas and power prices. So how are we responding? 
First, it's important to note that our ratable hedging strategy has largely inflated us from the effects in 2012. We started to hedge 2012 when PJM prices were significantly higher. We entered the year over 90% hedged in PJM for 2012, limiting the impact on our revenue net fuel in the near term. 
For 2013, as indicated in the December 31 hedge disclosure, we were near ratable hedge levels of 61% to 64%. Going forward, we expect to remain near our ratable hedging level. We have kept considerable length in the south portfolio in both 2012 and 2013 based on tightening reserve margins in the ERCOT market and attractive spot spreads in the on-peak hours, which we can capture with our peaking generation capacity in that market as we did in 2011.
In 2014 and '15, we still have a significant open position. We ultimately expect energy prices to adjust to fully reflect the benefits of environmental regulations. In the meantime, we are using more put options, which with a decline in market prices could take us above our ratable hedge levels. This will continue to protect us from further moves down in gas price, while still leaving upside for power prices to return to levels more in line with our fundamental views. 
As of now, our hedge percentages for 2013 and '14 include approximately 7% and 10% from put options, respectively. While we continue to remain disciplined in our hedging approach, we will also continue to be strategic in order to take advantage of upside in the market based on our fundamental views. We will accomplish this for use of put options, participation in various utility solicitations, leveraging our retail channel and carefully choosing the location of our sales. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

I believe there is -- there was some significant selling going on with -- the fear is that the gas market was going to continue to decline. I do think the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule had an immediate impact on forward power prices. So when you lump all these things together, you saw a lot of bearish sentiment in the market. Although some of that has recovered in the past week or so, I still see when I study spot market prices, spot market heat rates, when we look at our modeling, as I described in my commentary, I still see upside -- significant upside in the -- in heat rates based on the real fundamental factors that should be driving the market."

The next thing Chris is going to do is hunt for ways consistent with all our commitments in places like Maryland to cut costs. And we're going to deliver the merger synergies we promised you. We're going to do all those things, and that buys us a fairly substantial amount of space. But $2.40 gas isn't jolly. If you're really going to project that for 10 years, we've got a problem here. So Chris, you or Ken want to pick up on Steve's question? I mean, I don't think there is a number, Steve, but there is a mixer -- a mix of numbers and time.

You, by contrast, have provided, on a consistent basis, numbers that I have found to be trustworthy earnings estimates that generally were conservative and a very transparent look at the future trajectory of earnings.

As Steve Fleishman suggested, this I expect to be my last earnings call as CEO. And that's after 28 years of trying to be useful to all of you and to customers, all the way from little Skowhegan in Maine to here in Chicago. Obviously, I'm absolutely delighted to be able to end a very long career with what I hope and expect to be the completion of the Constellation acquisition. Exelon is a great company, and with Constellation and with Chris' leadership, it's going to be an even greater company. The only thing that could make me happier would be if power prices and earnings forecasts were back where they were in '07 and '08. That would make me happier because it would make you happier and make all of us richer. And that's the objective I've had in mind for all 28 years. But even though these aren't the best of times for Exelon, I'm still very proud that we have run this for our investors, and we've tried to do what Hugh Wynne suggested and give you straight numbers as soon as we know what they might be. And as I look at the situation, yes, I loved it when Exelon was 40% bigger than Southern, and I don't like seeing Southern and Duke and Dominion having more market cap than us right now. But the point I would like to make is before we regulate it, integrates are on the top of the curve, and we're right now in the trench. Things in '08 were too good for us to be true forever. Things right now won't be forever either. And while you wait for better times to come at Exelon, you can know that Chris will be working like hell to beat the computer projections. You know that we have as good a management team to do that as anybody in the industry, and you know that we have a very good dividend to sustain you in the meanwhile. But I did ask my colleagues to go back and try to come up with one capsule of what we have done for you during my years with ComEd and Exelon. And during my tenure, your TSR was 295%, that's more than 10% compounded through last week. And that beats both the S&P 500, which was only 4% for that period compounded, and the utility index has a little over 7% for the same period. And I say that when we're in the trough. Exelon will be back, I have a high level of confidence, and the people around me are those who will make it so. As Chart 15 suggests, there are a bunch of things that I am very, very proud of, none of which I did all by myself, some of which I made a large contribution to, some of which I mostly stayed out of the way for. But those include the merger that created Exelon and the one we're now doing with Constellation. It includes the sale of ComEd's fossil plants and putting Generation into a separate market-based business. It improves -- includes solving the reliability problems at ComEd, and we're going to help bring better service to Baltimore, too. It includes keeping our word in Pennsylvania when we did the merger there. I had a leading Pennsylvania public official say, ""You're almost the only people who ever kept all their commitments in the acquiring jurisdiction."" That's really important because in this business, they always know where to find you. I'm giving everyone Chris' home number, and he is very grateful. And if you don't keep the commitments, you don't have a very good field to play on for the next time. And one of the reasons we have been successful with Governor O'Malley in working out a deal is that people like Governor Rendell and Mayor Daley said, ""When these guys give their word, they keep it."" And it's very important, and we will keep our word in Maryland just like we have in Pennsylvania and in Illinois, and just like we have for you. I devoutly wish that I could leave you at a time when we have a higher stock price, but we have kept our words. We have focused entirely on what is good for our investors, and we have delivered over a very long time. We shall do so again. Thank you very much."

It's always a shame to waste someone as talented as Stacie reading the Safe Harbor language, but the lawyers keep saying, she has to do it. 
2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating performance; we grew the company through acquisitions, which are working on both on an earnings and cash flow basis; we made progress on a range of regulatory, legislative and market issues; and we are getting ever closer to consummating our merger with Constellation.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.82 per share. While December was a little disappointing due mostly to weather, our full year 2011 operating earnings per share of $4.16 were within our final guidance range, better than our 2010 results and well above our original expectations for the year. Our leading drivers in '11 were the strong performance of the generation fleet, led, of course, by our ninth consecutive year of over 93% capacity factors in nuclear that's helped significantly by our Texas operations. Tax benefits helped us a great deal. The impact of the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act was positive, as was our summer weather. The good news was partially offset by costly storms at both ComEd and PECO and lower than weather-normalized load at PECO. ComEd had a terrible July storm wise, which we soaked up successfully, and PECO had both a hurricane and a freak fall snowstorm. 
Matt will review the quarter-over-quarter and full year financial drivers in more detail. As you know, we made a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension at the beginning of the year, which along with Doug Brown's fine work on asset allocation, allowed us to end the year at 83% funded status. And remember, this is with very low discount rates. The contribution gives us added cushion in our FFO-to-debt credit metrics and will help us see the company through the current trough and power crisis. 
We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends. We are keenly aware that to all of you, the dividend is an absolutely critical part of our value proposition. It's what makes it possible for you to hold on with us while we work our way through the gas and power price trough. Our cash flows and credit metrics support our dividend and capital programs even as we accept a higher payout ratio. Chris Crane, who will answer most of the questions today about future performance, believes, as I do, in the continued importance to the dividend. Simply put, we get it. And he is as committed as I am to maintaining it.
As we have mentioned previously, given our pending merger with Constellation, we are not providing full year Exelon stand-alone guidance for 2012 on today's call. We will provide combined company guidance at an analyst day that we expect to hold after -- in the spring after the merger closes.
Turning to our operating results, I simply have to recognize Chip Pardee, Mike Pacilio, Susan Landahl and their team for Nuclear's fine year. Their capacity factor was 93.3% for 2011. As I said earlier, that is the ninth consecutive year they have beaten 93%. This is just a tremendous performance. They continue to renew their commitment. They continue to sharpen their edge. We are very, very proud of what our nuclear folks are doing. Exelon continues to be a leader in U.S. nuclear operations as we must be. 
Both ComEd and PECO faced significant storms in 2011. PECO's response to very large storms was absolutely best I've ever seen and far better than most of the other Northeastern utilities, many of which found themselves in more than a little trouble. Despite its summer storms, ComEd's outage frequency statistics were the best on record. Both delivery companies keep getting better.
Our power fleet in Texas, led by Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg, was very helpful to our earnings in both the first and the third quarters. Beyond the merger with Constellation, which is, of course, our major strategic endeavor, and I will cover a little later, we added significantly to our generation fleet in 2011. Our Exelon Wind business and the addition of the Wolf Hollow combined-cycle gas turbine in ERCOT added more than $40 million in earnings in 2011.
Exelon Nuclear added 138 megawatts of clean and profitable energy to our power upgrade program in 2011. In September, we added 230 megawatts of solar generation to our clean energy development pipeline with the acquisition of Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, to be funded in part through a DOE loan guarantee and backed by long-term power purchase agreement. The project will come online in phases this year and next, enabling us to realize investment tax credits and recover our investment by 2015. As we work on these renewable investments and related generation, we are being very careful to make certain we engage in investments that protect our credit ratings and improve our near-term cash flows.
Separately, Exelon Generation made investments in several transmission projects. We are seeing reduced congestion as a result around our Midwest nuclear plants as a result of these projects. They're a very good example of small things that have very positive leverage in terms of our value.
As you all know, 2011 was a very active year in the regulatory and legislative arena. PECO fully transitioned to market rates at the beginning of the year and continues to pursue its investment in smart meters. ComEd received a rate case order in May and worked on passage of its infrastructure legislation. The latter allows ComEd to implement a formula rate and will spur significant infrastructure investment in the electric grid, including over $230 million in 2012. 
Exelon, through Joe Dominguez, was a key player in the successful initiative to open the Ohio market to competition. FERC approved a formula rate filing for the so-called RITE line. We are closely monitoring the NRC's response to the Fukushima event. So far, the NRC has taken a thoughtful and measured approach to responding to this, and our nuclear organization is actively engaged in applying the lessons learned.
EPA issued its final Air Toxics Rule in December, which will lead to the retirement of the older and more inefficient coal plants. The final rule is largely as we expected and provides flexibility in the time line for those plants that will be working to comply. And from Exelon's point of view, the key thing is that people shut down those plants they intend to shut down. We expect that the toxics rule will be implemented on time beginning in 2015.
Unfortunately, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted a stay on the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which was supposed to go into effect on January 1. Our lawyers have reviewed it. We believe the EPA was within its authority, and the court will ultimately uphold the rule in large part. But although the stay is a setback, we believe that the Air Toxics Rule is the more important one in terms of driving plant retirements. We do not believe the stay will have a significant effect on the number of coal plant retirements to take place. And so far, what we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. Ken Cornew will address that more later.
Now it's fitting given the gas markets that our operator today is named Cassandra, because there hasn't been a whole lot of good news in the gas markets lately, so we have a cheerful fellow, named Cornew, to talk about it. It is no secret that our prices have declined since our last earnings call and that natural gas prices are the key driver. Spot natural gas prices have fallen more than 15% since the beginning of the year, partly due to the continued news about shale gas development, but also very much due to the mild temperatures that we have seen so far this winter. 
Energy prices have followed gas prices even more closely than usual and have reacted negatively to the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in late December. Thus, we have given back the gains we saw in July when the rule was finalized. Power Team continues to believe that the reaction to the gas prices and the stay is overdone, and we expect some near-term price recovery. Ken will talk about all of this in more detail in a few minutes and will also address how we're responding to the situation. 
Our merger with Constellation remains on track to close in the first quarter. We have received several more of the required approvals for the transaction, in particularly the all-important DOJ review, and we await final approvals by Maryland, the SC, the NRC and FERC. In Maryland, we were, of course, extremely pleased to have settled with a number of major parties to the case, including the Governor -- very much including the Governor, and we have now a schedule for final order from the PSC on February 17. We have asked the FERC to issue their final ruling early this year and remain hopeful that they will provide their final decision in the same time frame as the Maryland Commission. We will close the merger shortly after receiving all of the regulatory approvals.
Now just before I turn this over to Matt, 2011 was really a very good year for Exelon. Every part of the company contributed to making it a good year. And while we don't like the current state of the power markets at all, I am absolutely convinced that we will find ways to keep beating what the computer says this all means. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presenta",792,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presentation includes a significant amount of information regarding this quarter's results. We'll start by highlighting a few key items shown on Slide 7. 
Exelon closed out 2011 by delivering fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.82 per share and $4.16 per share for the full year, which includes $0.07 of unfavorable weather versus the prior year. We are pleased with our 2011 financial and operating performance and, as John discussed, our operating companies contributed significantly to these results.
Moving to Slide 8, Generation contributed $0.54 per share to the fourth quarter operating results and $3.01 per share for the year. Generation's fourth quarter results reflect favorable market conditions of $0.06 per share, which is primarily driven by net favorability for the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and hydro production. 
Now moving to ComEd on Slide 9, ComEd delivered operating earnings of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.61 per share for the full year, resulting in an annual earned ROE of 9.3%. ComEd's fourth quarter results included $0.06 per share benefit for the revenue requirement reconciliation and the establishment of a regulatory asset for storm costs related to the implementation of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act passed earlier this fall. The infrastructure legislation provides a reliable mechanism for the recovery of the $2.6 billion capital expenditures ComEd will make to modernize and upgrade the system over the next 10 years beginning in 2012. 
As required by the legislation, the Illinois Power Agency will conduct a procurement auction in February of this year for around-the-clock energy contracts for June 2013 to December 2017. The bids are due on February 10, and the Illinois Commerce Commission decision is scheduled for February 17.
Moving to PECO on Slide 10, PECO contributed $0.11 per share to the consolidated fourth quarter operating results and $0.58 per share for the year, resulting in an annual rate-making ROE of approximately 11%. The PECO region encountered its share of weather-related challenges in 2011, including Hurricane Irene in the third quarter and the surprise snowstorm in late October. PECO's fourth quarter results were impacted by 20% fewer-than-normal heating degree days as a result of the unseasonably warm temperatures. In total, unfavorable weather cost PECO $0.05 per share for the year versus the prior year.
With respect to load, ComEd and PECO's load trends details are included on -- in the appendix of today's presentation. For 2011, ComEd's total weather-normal load declined by 0.5% compared to 2010, in line with our third quarter projection. PECO's weather-normal total load declined by 0.9% for the year versus the projected 0.5% decline. 
In 2012, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2011 results, with only a small decline of 0.2% on a weather-normal basis. This is not a surprising projection given that many of the economic forecasts that impacts ComEd's load are expected to mimic 2011, including gross metro product, unemployment, housing starts and energy efficiency expansion. 
For PECO, as a result of the ramp down of the 2 oil refineries and the third expected by July 2012, plus weak economic conditions and energy efficiency programs, total electric deliveries are expected to decline by 5.4% compared to 2011 weather-normal results. Absent the oil refinery impacts, PECO's 2012 load forecast would only be down approximately 1.8% compared to 2011.
On Slide 11, you can see that we generated approximately $5 billion of cash from operations for 2011. ExGen HoCo's credit ratings are strong, ending the year with FFO-to-debt ratio of 52%, well above our target range of 30% to 35%. 
With respect to our merger with Constellation, we have concluded our post-merger legal structure and now plan to merge Constellation Energy Company into Exelon Corporation, and then transfer all of the Constellation Energy Company subsidiaries, excluding BGE, to Exelon Generation. Constellation Energy Company's existing debt will be assumed by Exelon Corp. and BGE will continue to exist as a separate subsidiary under Exelon. We expect to execute the structure reorganization immediately following the closing of the merger, and both companies have received the necessary bank consents to proceed.
As John mentioned, given the status of the merger, we will defer providing earnings guidance for 2012 until after we close. At our Analyst Day, we will provide consolidated earnings guidance for 2012, including our expected pension expense and contributions, and we will discuss the combined companies' strategic business objectives going forward. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it over to Ken Cornew for the discussion on power markets and hedging."

I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend",953,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend a few minutes this morning going over what we've witnessed recently in the gas and power markets, and let me start with the gas market. 
Natural gas prices have continued to move lower on strong production and an unprecedented lack of winter weather. Weak estimated [ph] growth and general bearishness on economic growth are adding to the downward pressure. These factors are resulting in significant gas storage inventories that would persist with continued mild weather, which would be a drag on gas prices through 2012 and potentially into 2013. 
Between September 30, 2011 and the end of the year, 2013 and '14 natural gas prices dropped by approximately $0.80. And as John mentioned, over the first 3 weeks of the year, prices have fallen almost another $0.30 and prompt month gas has hit levels last seen in January 2002.
Longer term, in the 2014 and 2016 time period, we expect natural gas prices in the $4 to $6 range, which we believe is supported by the long-run margin on cost of production. This will be dependent on reasonable levels of gas demand growth, some of which we expect to come from coal plant retirements and the expected resulting increase in natural gas generation as a replacement source of power. Producer discipline will need to be a key part of the longer-term response to lower gas prices. We saw one announcement earlier this week of a shift from dry gas to more liquids-rich plays, and we would expect that will continue. 
What's been more surprising to us over the last several weeks is the over response to these lower gas prices in the power markets. We continue to believe that the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards or MATS will have a significant impact on coal generation economics, causing the retirement of old inefficient and unscrubbed plants. We've updated our modeling of MATS to reflect both the recent drop in gas prices and the finalized rule and believe its impact on power prices into 2015 time frame to be in the $3 to $5 range at West Hub and NiHub. This price impact is due to a combination of coal retirements and their effect on the existing generation stack, as well as higher dispatch cost for newly retrofitted units. 
Given the recent decrease in market power prices, our modeling is suggesting that little to no impact of MATS is priced into the current NiHub and West Hub market prices. While we expect power prices to decrease -- and let me explain why. While we expect power prices to decrease under a falling gas environment, we would actually expect heat rates to expand and not fall. For example, looking back to September 30 prices, we felt that the market was incorporating a significant portion of the mass regulations. NiHub's 2016 market prices was approximately $44 a megawatt hour, and gas was at $5.60 in MMbtu, implying a market heat rate of 7.8. 
As of January 4, gas prices had fallen to $4.90. Our internal modeling, which reflects mass regulations, suggest that heat rates should have increased to approximately 8.5. However, actual power prices were close to $36, implying a market heat rate of under 7.5. This reduced heat rate indicates that the market is currently undervalued by at least $5 a megawatt. 
Some of the weakness in the forward heat rates could be attributed to a potential lack of liquidity, the stay of Cross-State Air Pollutant Rule and early selling pressure. I should point out that this assessment changes every day based on movements in gas and power prices. So how are we responding? 
First, it's important to note that our ratable hedging strategy has largely inflated us from the effects in 2012. We started to hedge 2012 when PJM prices were significantly higher. We entered the year over 90% hedged in PJM for 2012, limiting the impact on our revenue net fuel in the near term. 
For 2013, as indicated in the December 31 hedge disclosure, we were near ratable hedge levels of 61% to 64%. Going forward, we expect to remain near our ratable hedging level. We have kept considerable length in the south portfolio in both 2012 and 2013 based on tightening reserve margins in the ERCOT market and attractive spot spreads in the on-peak hours, which we can capture with our peaking generation capacity in that market as we did in 2011.
In 2014 and '15, we still have a significant open position. We ultimately expect energy prices to adjust to fully reflect the benefits of environmental regulations. In the meantime, we are using more put options, which with a decline in market prices could take us above our ratable hedge levels. This will continue to protect us from further moves down in gas price, while still leaving upside for power prices to return to levels more in line with our fundamental views. 
As of now, our hedge percentages for 2013 and '14 include approximately 7% and 10% from put options, respectively. While we continue to remain disciplined in our hedging approach, we will also continue to be strategic in order to take advantage of upside in the market based on our fundamental views. We will accomplish this for use of put options, participation in various utility solicitations, leveraging our retail channel and carefully choosing the location of our sales. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

I do think the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule had an immediate impact on forward power prices.

But if, for some reason, they are, we have time to make adjustments as required, and we're as committed to the dividend as ever, and it will never be a surprise to you. So the way we look at it, if we're in trouble, we're the lowest cost in the stack. Where is everybody else and how is this sustainable? So with the hedging, with room in the balance sheet, we have time and we'll prudently go through it. And you won't be surprised if something ever happens."

You, by contrast, have provided, on a consistent basis, numbers that I have found to be trustworthy earnings estimates that generally were conservative and a very transparent look at the future trajectory of earnings.

As Steve Fleishman suggested, this I expect to be my last earnings call as CEO. And that's after 28 years of trying to be useful to all of you and to customers, all the way from little Skowhegan in Maine to here in Chicago. Obviously, I'm absolutely delighted to be able to end a very long career with what I hope and expect to be the completion of the Constellation acquisition. Exelon is a great company, and with Constellation and with Chris' leadership, it's going to be an even greater company. The only thing that could make me happier would be if power prices and earnings forecasts were back where they were in '07 and '08. That would make me happier because it would make you happier and make all of us richer. And that's the objective I've had in mind for all 28 years. But even though these aren't the best of times for Exelon, I'm still very proud that we have run this for our investors, and we've tried to do what Hugh Wynne suggested and give you straight numbers as soon as we know what they might be. And as I look at the situation, yes, I loved it when Exelon was 40% bigger than Southern, and I don't like seeing Southern and Duke and Dominion having more market cap than us right now. But the point I would like to make is before we regulate it, integrates are on the top of the curve, and we're right now in the trench. Things in '08 were too good for us to be true forever. Things right now won't be forever either. And while you wait for better times to come at Exelon, you can know that Chris will be working like hell to beat the computer projections. You know that we have as good a management team to do that as anybody in the industry, and you know that we have a very good dividend to sustain you in the meanwhile. But I did ask my colleagues to go back and try to come up with one capsule of what we have done for you during my years with ComEd and Exelon. And during my tenure, your TSR was 295%, that's more than 10% compounded through last week. And that beats both the S&P 500, which was only 4% for that period compounded, and the utility index has a little over 7% for the same period. And I say that when we're in the trough. Exelon will be back, I have a high level of confidence, and the people around me are those who will make it so. As Chart 15 suggests, there are a bunch of things that I am very, very proud of, none of which I did all by myself, some of which I made a large contribution to, some of which I mostly stayed out of the way for. But those include the merger that created Exelon and the one we're now doing with Constellation. It includes the sale of ComEd's fossil plants and putting Generation into a separate market-based business. It improves -- includes solving the reliability problems at ComEd, and we're going to help bring better service to Baltimore, too. It includes keeping our word in Pennsylvania when we did the merger there. I had a leading Pennsylvania public official say, ""You're almost the only people who ever kept all their commitments in the acquiring jurisdiction."" That's really important because in this business, they always know where to find you. I'm giving everyone Chris' home number, and he is very grateful. And if you don't keep the commitments, you don't have a very good field to play on for the next time. And one of the reasons we have been successful with Governor O'Malley in working out a deal is that people like Governor Rendell and Mayor Daley said, ""When these guys give their word, they keep it."" And it's very important, and we will keep our word in Maryland just like we have in Pennsylvania and in Illinois, and just like we have for you. I devoutly wish that I could leave you at a time when we have a higher stock price, but we have kept our words. We have focused entirely on what is good for our investors, and we have delivered over a very long time. We shall do so again. Thank you very much."

As you saw on our release this morning, Exelon has delivered solid performance for the quarter. Our operating earnings per share were $0.61 for the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Our Nuclear organization continue to run the fleet well, turning in the capacity factor of 93. 4% for the second quarter, a period that included 51 planned refueling outage days at 2 units. The first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 93.5%. The performance of the entire generation fleet was very good.
Our commercial operations also performed well and actively managing the portfolio. In the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, our decision to be ahead of routable in prior quarters allowed us the opportunity to slow down our hedging volume in this quarter. In Texas, as prices moved up during the second quarter, we accelerated our hedging activity to lock in the upside of 2012 and 2013. In addition, our retail sales channels are meeting expectations for added margins and volumes. As you can see in the hedge disclosure, the second quarter had a dip in the market, but we believe in July we've made up over half of that in the open gross margin and Ken and Jack can address those questions as we get to the Q&A.
At our utilities, the summer has brought extreme heat along with some violent storms. Our utility system, whether the heat extremely well when we experienced 8 to 12 consecutive days of temperatures above 90 degrees across these 3 service territories. The storm brought more of a challenge, particularly in the BGE service territory, which experienced more damaging storms in BGE's nearly 200-year history. Both Maryland and Illinois were hit by significant storms. In total, the utilities restored power to approximately 1.2 million customers during the first week of July.
I would really like to thank our utility crews at BGE, ComEd and PECO for their tireless efforts to restore the service to our customers, also often through intense heat periods. 
We spoke to you at length in our Analyst Day in June and provided you with significant amount of information. We remain on track with what we told you. Not much has changed. Therefore, our presentation prepared remarks in presentation today are short, leaving additional time for questions. Additionally, in the spirit of continued transparency, we have provided additional information in our Appendix, which is to assist you in financial modeling efforts.
I do continue to be extremely pleased with our merger. The operation has been seamless due in the large part to a very effective integration planning and how well we are working together. We remain on track to achieve $100 million -- $170 million of merger-related O&M synergies for 2012. Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2012 full year earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share, and we expect to be comfortably within that range. Jack will cover our financial performance in greater detail in a few moments, but let me first give you an update on regulatory developments at ComEd and BGE and our expectations for growth capital at Exelon Generation over the next 3 years.
Turning to Slide 3. On June 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission agreed key elements of the Conrad 2011 formula rate filing, including the treatment of the pension asset. We view the ICC's decision as a step in the right direction. ComEd's goal is to provide customers with better service, more choices and greater control over their electric bills. We are committed to working with the regulators to make sure we can make the investments necessary to fulfill these promises of our customers. 
We also believe our positions are soundly supported by the existing legislation. The ICC's timeline for rehearing calls for an order by September 19 of this year with hearings beginning later this week. Reversal of the original ICC decision on the rehearing items could improve ComEd's earnings by as much as $0.10 per share in 2012.
Turning to BGE. On July 27, BGE filed a combined electric and gas rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The rate case reflects a $204 million increase in revenue requirements for both electric and gas, with the requested ROE of 10.5%. BGE needs to make investments in assets and systems to maintain and improve electric reliability,  ensure gas safety and meet increasing compliance obligations. In order for BGE to continue to make these needed investments to serve the customers, it requires the opportunity to earn a fair return. We expect an order from the Maryland PSC by February of 2013, with hearings to be set for later in the fourth quarter.
Now I want to spend a few moments on our growth capital expectations for Exelon Generation for the next 3 years. At our Analyst Day in June, we presented our CapEx expectations through 2014. In those numbers, we included $800 million of undesignated spend in our renewable business for 2013 and 2014. This is a conservative planning view, which affords us flexibility if we find the right opportunities. We continue to assess the viability of the spend. Our decision to move forward with projects will be driven by value creation for our shareholders, which will largely be determined by the extension of the federal investment tax credits and balance sheet flexibility. In Silver Ranch 1 in California as an example of this type of renewable project we find attractive. The 230-megawatt Solar facility progressing according to plan. The first portion of the project is expected to be online in October of 2012, and we expect commercial operations in late in 2013.
Valley will be free flow accretive in 2013 and due to the project financing, we have minimal impact on our credit metrics as calculated by S&P. We expect to fully recover our investment by 2015. If we find similar growth opportunities, we will pursue them. We have created flexibility in our balance sheet by incorporating this undesignated spend. 
Before I turn over to Jack to review our financial results, there are a few things I want to reiterate. First, this quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to operational and financial results. I remain extremely pleased with the merger, it is working. We are already seeing benefits. As I said at our Analyst Day, we have the right strategy, the right platform, the right set of assets and the right leadership to manage through the market downturn and deliver unparalleled upside when the markets recover. In the meantime, we remain committed our investment-grade, balance sheet and our dividend. Exelon is the best-positioned company in the industry. With that, I'll turn it over to Jack to cover more details on the finances."

Let's begin with a summary of this quarter's fin",1210,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will supplement the earnings press release issued this morning, which includes the substantial level of detail about Exelon's financial results. 
Let's begin with a summary of this quarter's financial results by operating company on Slide 4. Due to the merger, the composition of current quarter earnings for ExGen, BGE or Exelon are not comparable to last year. Thus, I'll highlight a few key results for the quarter and stepping through our comparison to last year. 
We are pleased to have delivered non-GAAP operating results of $0.61 per share this quarter. Our earnings are tracking well within our full year guidance range as a result of Exelon's operational performance. ExGen's $0.47 non-GAAP earnings per share contribution is in line with what we expected for the quarter. At utilities, ComEd recorded $0.05 non-GAAP operating earnings per share this quarter, about $0.10 lower than it would've been if not for the impacts of the ICC order in their formula rate case. Given that the Commission agreed to revisit their ruling and ComEd formerly rate case, we are hopeful for a favorable outcome. The final decision will not be known until September 19. Thus, ComEd's financial results reflect the year to date impacts of them a order.
PECO and BGE rounded up earnings this quarter with contributions $0.10 and $0.02 per share respectively. With respect to weather, ComEd's quarter results include a $0.01 benefit due to June's above average heat, while the financial impact from weather at PECO and BGE is negligible this quarter. 
At PECO,  the above average heat experienced in the quarter was offset by fewer than normal heating degree days. And BGE's decoupling mechanism largely offsets the net impact of load variances. Updated load trends were ComEd and PECO are in the Appendix of today's presentation for either of you at your convenience. You'll notice that PECO's load has improved since our Analyst Day presentation. As a result of positive development surrounding the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips and Sunoco's Pennsylvania oil refineries, PECO now expect the year-over-year weather-normal decline of 2% versus the 3.3% decline in load previously projected.
Turning to Slide 5. The commercial team continued to execute on the portfolio management and load serving strategies outlined by Ken at Analyst Day. We made progress on our growth objectives in the brief times since disclosing our targets and have locked in an additional $150 million of gross margin towards our new business targets for the year. In our Midwest to Mid-Atlantic base load regions, we were able to slow the pace of our hedging activity this quarter in a flatter market price environment. In 2013 and 2014, our hedge percentages increased 3% to 5% this quarter versus a typically ratable 8%. This opportunity was created through due to our efforts to be ahead of ratable in the previous several quarters when market conditions were more favorable.
In the ERCOT region, we captured value from the link we carried into the quarter and timed our sales to capture the higher pricing prevalent early in the quarter. This execution led to a $1 per megawatt hour increase in the effective ERCOT realized energy prices for 2013 and 2014. We remain well-positioned to meet our load serving sales targets. Our sales teams remain active in all competitive markets, renewing existing customers and attracting new customers from all customer classes. We'll provide a more comprehensive status check and update of our load serving business growth at EEI.
An update of Exelon's sources and uses of cash is on Slide 6. We've had some movement in our planned CapEx spend for the year. However, the changes are primarily minor timing-related shifts and all 2012 projects are still on track, including the $2 billion we're investing in attractive and TV positive growth projects. The more significant changes in our cash flow projections relate to tax settlements and debt financings. Regarding tax settlements, the majority of the $550 million decline in cash from operations is associated with a shift in the timing of refunds associated with settlements of our 2002 to 2006 tax filings with the IRS. The refunds, which have been agreed to by the IRS appeals, are now expected to be delayed until sometime in 2013 or 2014 due to a procedural change in the handling of partial settlements. Given the anticipated timing of the back settlement, ComEd is forward a previously planned 2013 issuance to fund needs in the interim. At PECO, given the attractive interest rate environment, we are refinancing an incremental $100 million of the  planned debt retirements, bringing total issuance to $350 million. This will also help reduce expected future financing needs.
In June, ExGen completed its planned $775 million debt issuance with solid pricing that compared well to its 2010 debt offering. The 10-year and 30-year price at 4.25% and 5.6%, respectively compared to the 4.0% and 5.75% coupon achieved for the 10-year and 30 year offerings in September of 2010. These funds would be used for general purposes of the company, including investment growth. ExGen also announced they completed a private exchange offer for all the outstanding 7.6% senior notes due in 2032. Of the $700 million principal outstanding, more than 63% were tendered and exchanged for cash and notes that will expire in 2022 and 2042. Going forward, this debt exchange will lower our annual pretax cash interest expense by approximately $7 million.
And I'm pleased to announce that we are executing on and amend an spend strategy for $7 billion of credit facilities, which will enable 3 key benefits. First, it will extend the tender by 1 year on Exelon Corps, Exelon Generations and PECO facility, and by 2 years on BGE's credit facility resulting in 2017 maturity for all our facilities. Second, we will be able to realign the bank group with a combined company, framing in new banks and ensuring all banks lend to each operating  company within the Exelon family. Third, we will capture current market pricing consistent with what we pay on ComEd's $1 billion credit facility refinanced earlier this year. We expect to close in the amended facilities in August.
Before I open up the call for questions, I want to look ahead to next quarter's earnings. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating earnings in the range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and we remain confident that we will achieve our full year earnings target of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. Our earnings guidance range adequately accounts for the impact of weather and incremental storms incurred in July. Most notably, it reflects $0.03 of incremental storm cost that BGE for the storm. We are confident about achieving our financial targets this year, and there are several factors that give us a line of sight on this goal, including our ability to hit synergy targets. 
To date, we've initiated and completed several milestones that will position us to achieve our $500 million run rate O&M savings starting in 2014. Staffing and selection was finalized at the end of June. Contract negotiations are in progress to incorporate our increased scale and scope and vendor contract pricing, and we eliminated an additional portion of our surplus credit facility. And with that, we're ready to take questions."

Our nuclear organization continue to run the fleet well, turning in a capacity factor of 93.4% for the second quarter, a period that included 51 planned refueling outage days at 2 units. The first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 93.5%. The performance of the entire generation fleet was very good.
Our commercial operations also performed well and actively managing the portfolio. In the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, our decision to be ahead of ratable in prior quarters allowed us the opportunity to slow down our hedging volume in this quarter. In Texas, as prices moved up during the second quarter, we accelerated our hedging activity to lock in the upside of 2012 and 2013. In addition, our retail sales channels are meeting expectations for added margins and volumes. As you can see in the hedge disclosure, the second quarter had a dip in the market, but we believe in July, we've made up over half of that on the open gross margin, and Ken and Jack can address those questions as we get to the Q&A.
At our utilities, this summer has brought extreme heat along with some violent storms. Our utilities system weathered the heat extremely well when we experienced 8 to 12 consecutive days of temperatures above 90 degrees across these 3 service territories. The storm brought more of a challenge, particularly in the BGE service territory, which experienced one of the most damaging storms in BGE's nearly 200-year history. Both Maryland and Illinois were hit by significant storms. In total, the utilities restored power to approximately 1.2 million customers during the first week of July.
I would really like to thank our utility crews at BGE, ComEd and PECO for their tireless efforts to restore the service to our customers, also -- or often through intense heat periods. 
We spoke to you at length in our Analyst Day in June and provided you with a significant amount of information. We remain on track with what we told you. Not much has changed. Therefore, our presentation -- prepared remarks and presentation today are short, leaving additional time for questions. Additionally, in the spirit of continued transparency, we have provided additional information in our Appendix, which assists you in financial modeling efforts.
I do continue to be extremely pleased with our merger. The operation has been seamless due in the large part to a very effective integration planning and how well we are working together. We remain on track to achieve $100 million -- $170 million of merger-related O&M synergies for 2012. Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2012 full year earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share, and we expect to be comfortably within that range. Jack will cover our financial performance in greater detail in a few moments, but let me first give you an update on regulatory developments at ComEd and BGE and our expectations for growth capital at Exelon Generation over the next 3 years.
Turning to Slide 3. On June 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission agreed to rehear key elements of the ComEd's 2011 formula rate filing, including the treatment of the pension asset. We view the ICC's decision as a step in the right direction. ComEd's goal is to provide customers with better service, more choices and greater control over their electric bills. We are committed to working with the regulators to make sure we can make the investments necessary to fulfill these promises to our customers. 
We also believe our positions are soundly supported by the existing legislation. The ICC's timeline for rehearing calls run order by September 19 of this year with hearings beginning later this week. Reversal of the original ICC decision on the rehearing items could improve ComEd earnings by as much as $0.10 per share in 2012.
Turning to BGE. On July 27, BGE filed a combined electric and gas rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The rate case reflects a $204 million increase in revenue requirements for both electric and gas, with the requested ROE of 10.5%. BGE needs to make investments in assets and systems to maintain and improve electric reliability,  ensure gas safety and meet increasing compliance obligations. In order for BGE to continue to make these needed investments to serve the customers, it requires the opportunity to earn a fair return. We expect an order from the Maryland PSC by February of 2013, with hearings to be set for later in the fourth quarter.
Now I want to spend a few moments on our growth capital expectations for Exelon Generation for the next 3 years. At our Analyst Day in June, we presented our CapEx expectations through 2014. In those numbers, we included $800 million of undesignated spend in our renewable business for 2013 and 2014. This is a conservative planning view, which affords us flexibility if we find the right opportunities. We continue to assess the viability of the spend. Our decision to move forward with projects will be driven by value creation for our shareholders, which will largely be determined by the extension of the federal investment tax credits and balance sheet flexibility. Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One in California is an example of this type of renewable project we find attractive. The 230-megawatt Solar facility, progressing according to plan, the first portion of the project is expected to be online in October of 2012, and we expect commercial operations in late in 2013.
Antelope Valley will be free cash flow accretive in 2013 and due to the project financing, we have minimal impact on our credit metrics as calculated by S&P. We expect to fully recover our investment by 2015. If we find similar growth opportunities, we will pursue them. We have created flexibility in our balance sheet by incorporating this undesignated spend. 
Before I turn over to Jack to review our financial results, there are a few things I want to reiterate. First, this quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to operational and financial results. I remain extremely pleased with the merger, it is working. We are already seeing benefits. As I said at our Analyst Day, we have the right strategy, the right platform, the right set of assets and the right leadership to manage through the market downturn and deliver unparalleled upside when the markets recover. In the meantime, we remain committed to our investment-grade balance sheet and our dividend. Exelon is the best-positioned company in the industry. With that, I'll turn it over to Jack to cover more details on the finances."
296181,214299679,336915,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will supplement the earnings press release issued this morning, which includes a substantial level of detail about Exelon's financial results. Let's begin with the summary of this quarter's fin",1209,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will supplement the earnings press release issued this morning, which includes a substantial level of detail about Exelon's financial results. 
Let's begin with the summary of this quarter's financial results by operating company on Slide 4. Due to the merger, the composition of current quarter earnings for ExGen, BGE and Exelon are not comparable to last year. Thus, I'll highlight a few key results for the quarter in lieu of stepping through a comparison to last year. 
We are pleased to have delivered non-GAAP operating results of $0.61 per share this quarter. Our earnings are tracking well within our full year guidance range as a result of Exelon's operational performance. ExGen's $0.47 non-GAAP earnings per share contribution is in line with what we expected for the quarter. At utilities, ComEd recorded $0.05 non-GAAP operating earnings per share this quarter, about $0.10 lower than it would've been if not for the impacts of the ICC order in their formula rate case. Given that the Commission agreed to revisit their ruling in ComEd's formerly rate case, we're hopeful for a favorable outcome. The final decision will not be known until September 19. Thus, ComEd's financial results reflect the year to date impacts of May order.
PECO and BGE rounded out earnings this quarter with contributions of $0.10 and $0.02 per share, respectively. With respect to weather, ComEd's quarter results include a $0.01 benefit due to June's above average heat, while the financial impact from weather at PECO and BGE is negligible this quarter. 
At PECO,  the above average heat experienced in the quarter was offset by fewer than normal heating degree days, and BGE's decoupling mechanism largely offsets the net impact of load variances. Updated load trend slides for ComEd and PECO are in the Appendix of today's presentation for you to review at your convenience. You'll notice that PECO's load outlook has improved since our Analyst Day presentation. As a result of positive development surrounding the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips and Sunoco's Pennsylvania oil refineries, PECO now expects a year-over-year, weather-normal decline of 2% versus the 3.3% decline in load previously projected.
Turning to Slide 5. The commercial team continued to execute on the portfolio management and load serving strategies outlined by Ken at Analyst Day. We've made progress on our growth objectives in the brief time since disclosing our targets and have locked in an additional $150 million of gross margin towards our new business targets for the year. In our Midwest to Mid-Atlantic base load regions, we were able to slow the pace of our hedging activity this quarter in a flatter market price environment. In 2013 and 2014, our hedge percentages increased 3% to 5% this quarter versus a typically ratable 8%. This opportunity was created due to our efforts to be ahead of ratable in the previous several quarters when market conditions were more favorable.
In the ERCOT region, we captured value from the link we carried into the quarter and timed our sales to capture the higher pricing prevalent earlier in the quarter. This execution led to a $1 per megawatt hour increase in the effective ERCOT realized energy prices for 2013 and 2014. We remain well positioned to meet our load serving sales targets. Our sales teams remain active in all competitive markets, renewing existing customers and attracting new customers from all customer classes. We'll provide a more comprehensive status check and update of our load serving business growth at EEI.
An update of Exelon's sources and uses of cash is on Slide 6. We've had some movement in our planned CapEx spend for the year. However, the changes are primarily minor timing-related shifts, and all 2012 projects are still on track, including the $2 billion we're investing in attractive NPV positive growth projects. The more significant changes in our cash flow projections relate to tax settlements and debt financings. Regarding tax settlements, the majority of the $550 million decline in cash from operations is associated with a shift in the timing of refunds associated with settlements of our 2002 to 2006 tax filings with the IRS. The refunds, which have been agreed to by the IRS appeals, are now expected to be delayed until sometime in 2013 or 2014 due to a procedural change in the handling of partial settlements. Given the anticipated timing of the back settlement, ComEd is pulling forward a previously planned 2013 issuance to fund needs in the interim. At PECO, given the attractive interest rate environment, we are refinancing an incremental $100 million of the  planned debt retirements, bringing total issuance to $350 million. This will also help reduce expected future financing needs.
In June, ExGen completed its planned $775 million debt issuance with solid pricing that compared well to its 2010 debt offering. The 10-year and 30-year priced at 4.25% and 5.6%, respectively, compared to the 4.0% and 5.75% coupon achieved for the 10-year and 30-year offerings in September of 2010. These funds will be used for general purposes of the company, including investment growth. ExGen also announced they completed a private exchange offer for all the outstanding 7.6% senior notes due in 2032. Of the $700 million principal outstanding, more than 63% were tendered in exchange for cash and notes that will expire in 2022 and 2042. Going forward, this debt exchange will lower our annual pretax cash interest expense by approximately $7 million.
And I'm pleased to announce that we are executing on an amended expense strategy for $7 billion in credit facilities, which will enable 3 key benefits. First, we'll extend the tender by 1 year on Exelon Corp.'s, Exelon Generation's and PECO's facility, and by 2 years on BGE's credit facility, resulting in a 2017 maturity for all our facilities. Second, we'll be able to realign the bank group with the combined company, bringing in new banks and ensuring all banks lend to each operating company within the Exelon family. Third, we'll capture current market pricing consistent with what we pay on ComEd's $1 billion credit facility refinanced earlier this year. We expect to close in the amended facilities in August.
Before I open up the call for questions, I want to look ahead to next quarter's earnings. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating earnings in the range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and we remain confident that we will achieve our full year earnings target of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. Our earnings guidance range adequately accounts for the impact of weather and incremental storms incurred in July. Most notably, it reflects $0.03 of incremental storm cost at BGE for the derecho storm. We are confident about achieving our financial targets this year, and there are several factors that give us line of sight on this goal, including our ability to hit synergy targets. 
To date, we've initiated and completed several milestones that will position us to achieve our $500 million run rate O&M savings starting in 2014. Staffing and selection was finalized at the end of June. Contract negotiations are in progress to incorporate our increased scale and scope and vendor contract pricing, and we eliminated an additional portion of our surplus credit facility. And with that, we're ready to take questions."

Our nuclear organization continued to run the fleet well, turning in a capacity factor of 93.4% for the second quarter, a period that included 51 planned refueling outage days at 2 units. The first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 93.5%. The performance of the entire generation fleet was very good.
Our commercial operations also performed well in actively managing the portfolio. In the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, our decision to be ahead of ratable in prior quarters allowed us the opportunity to slow down our hedging volume in this quarter. In Texas, as prices moved up during the second quarter, we accelerated our hedging activity to lock in the upside of 2012 and 2013. In addition, our retail sales channels are meeting expectations for added margins and volumes. As you can see in the hedge disclosure, the second quarter had a dip in the market, but we believe in July, we've made up over half of that on the open gross margin, and Ken and Jack can address those questions as we get to the Q&A.
At our utilities, this summer has brought extreme heat along with some violent storms. Our utilities system weathered the heat extremely well when we experienced 8 to 12 consecutive days of temperatures above 90 degrees across the 3 service territories. The storm brought more of a challenge, particularly in the BGE service territory, which experienced one of the most damaging storms in BGE's nearly 200-year history. Both Maryland and Illinois were hit by significant storms. In total, the utilities restored power to approximately 1.2 million customers during the first week of July.
I would really like to thank our utility crews at BGE, ComEd and PECO for their tireless efforts to restore the service to our customers, also -- or often through intense heat periods. 
We spoke to you at length at our Analyst Day in June and provided you with a significant amount of information. We remain on track with what we told you. Not much has changed. Therefore, our presentation -- prepared remarks and presentation today are short, leaving additional time for questions. Additionally, in the spirit of continued transparency, we have provided additional information in our Appendix, which assists you in financial modeling efforts.
I do continue to be extremely pleased with our merger. The operations has been seamless due to a large part to a very effective integration planning and how well we are working together. We remain on track to achieve $100 million -- $170 million of merger-related O&M synergies for 2012. Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2012 full year earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share, and we expect to be comfortably within that range. Jack will cover our financial performance in greater detail in a few moments, but let me first give you an update on regulatory developments at ComEd and BGE and our expectations for growth capital at Exelon Generation over the next 3 years.
Turning to Slide 3. On June 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission agreed to rehear key elements of the ComEd's 2011 formula rate filing, including the treatment of the pension asset. We view the ICC's decision as a step in the right direction. ComEd's goal is to provide customers with better service, more choices and greater control over their electric bills. We are committed to working with the regulators to make sure we can make the investments necessary to fulfill these promises to our customers. 
We also believe our positions are soundly supported by the existing legislation. The ICC's timeline for rehearing calls are on order by September 19 of this year with hearings beginning later this week. Reversal of the original ICC decision on the rehearing items could improve ComEd earnings by as much as $0.10 per share in 2012.
Turning to BGE. On July 27, BGE filed a combined electric and gas rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The rate case reflects a $204 million increase in revenue requirements for both electric and gas, with the requested ROE of 10.5%. BGE needs to make investments in assets and systems to maintain and improve electric reliability,  ensure gas safety and meet increasing compliance obligations. In order for BGE to continue to make these needed investments to serve the customers, it requires the opportunity to earn a fair return. We expect an order from the Maryland PSC by February of 2013, with hearings to be set for later in the fourth quarter.
Now I want to spend a few moments on our growth capital expectations for Exelon Generation for the next 3 years. At our Analyst Day in June, we presented our CapEx expectations through 2014. In those numbers, we included $800 million of undesignated spend in our renewable business for 2013 and 2014. This is a conservative planning view, which affords us flexibility if we find the right opportunities. We continue to assess the viability of the spend. Our decision to move forward with projects will be driven by value creation for our shareholders, which will largely be determined by the extension of the federal investment tax credits and balance sheet flexibility. Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One in California is an example of this type of renewable project we find attractive. The 230-megawatt solar facility, progressing according to plan, the first portion of the project is expected to be online in October of 2012, and we expect commercial operations in late in 2013.
Antelope Valley will be free cash flow accretive in 2013 and due to the project financing, we have minimal impact on our credit metrics as calculated by S&P. We expect to fully recover our investment by 2015. If we find similar growth opportunities, we will pursue them. We have created flexibility in our balance sheet by incorporating this undesignated spend. 
Before I turn over to Jack to review our financial results, there are a few things I want to reiterate. First, this quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to operational and financial results. I remain extremely pleased with the merger, it is working. We are already seeing benefits. As I said at our Analyst Day, we have the right strategy, the right platform, the right set of assets and the right leadership to manage through the market downturn and deliver unparalleled upside when the markets recover. In the meantime, we remain committed to our investment-grade balance sheet and our dividend. Exelon is the best-positioned company in the industry. With that, I'll turn it over to Jack to cover more details on the finances."

My commentary will supplement the earnings press release issued this morning, which includes a substantial level of detail about Exelon's financial results. 
Let's begin with the summary of this quarter's financial results by operating company on Slide 4. Due to the merger, the composition of current quarter earnings for ExGen, BGE and Exelon are not comparable to last year. Thus, I'll highlight a few key results for the quarter in lieu of stepping through a comparison to last year. 
We are pleased to have delivered non-GAAP operating results of $0.61 per share this quarter. Our earnings are tracking well within our full year guidance range as a result of Exelon's operational performance. ExGen's $0.47 non-GAAP earnings per share contribution is in line with what we expected for the quarter. At the utilities, ComEd recorded $0.05 non-GAAP operating earnings per share this quarter, about $0.10 lower than it would've been if not for the impacts of the ICC order in their formula rate case. Given that the Commission agreed to revisit their ruling in ComEd's formula rate case, we're hopeful for a favorable outcome. The final decision will not be known until September 19. Thus, ComEd's financial results reflect the year-to-date impacts of the May order.
PECO and BGE rounded out earnings this quarter with contributions of $0.10 and $0.02 per share, respectively. With respect to weather, ComEd's quarter results include a $0.01 benefit due to June's above average heat, while the financial impact from weather at PECO and BGE is negligible this quarter. 
At PECO,  the above average heat experienced in the quarter was offset by fewer than normal heating degree days, and BGE's decoupling mechanism largely offsets the net impact of load variances. Updated load trend slides for ComEd and PECO are in the Appendix of today's presentation for you to review at your convenience. You'll notice that PECO's load outlook has improved since our Analyst Day presentation. As a result of positive development surrounding the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips and Sunoco's Pennsylvania oil refineries, PECO now expects a year-over-year, weather-normal decline of 2% versus the 3.3% decline in load previously projected.
Turning to Slide 5. The commercial team continued to execute on the portfolio management and load serving strategies outlined by Ken at Analyst Day. We've made progress on our growth objectives in the brief time since disclosing our targets and have locked in an additional $150 million of gross margin towards our new business targets for the year. In our Midwest to Mid-Atlantic base load regions, we were able to slow the pace of our hedging activity this quarter in a flatter market price environment. In 2013 and 2014, our hedge percentages increased 3% to 5% this quarter versus a typically ratable 8%. This opportunity was created due to our efforts to be ahead of ratable in the previous several quarters when market conditions were more favorable.
In the ERCOT region, we captured value from the link we carried into the quarter and timed our sales to capture the higher pricing prevalent earlier in the quarter. This execution led to a $1 per megawatt hour increase in the effective ERCOT realized energy prices for 2013 and 2014. We remain well positioned to meet our load serving sales targets. Our sales teams remain active in all competitive markets, renewing existing customers and attracting new customers from all customer classes. We'll provide a more comprehensive status check and update of our load serving business growth at EEI.
An update of Exelon's sources and uses of cash is on Slide 6. We've had some movement in our planned CapEx spend for the year. However, the changes are primarily minor timing-related shifts, and all 2012 projects are still on track, including the $2 billion we're investing in attractive NPV positive growth projects. The more significant changes in our cash flow projections relate to tax settlements and debt financings. Regarding tax settlements, the majority of the $550 million decline in cash from operations is associated with a shift in the timing of refunds associated with settlements of our 2002 to 2006 tax filings with the IRS. The refunds, which have been agreed to by the IRS appeals, are now expected to be delayed until sometime in 2013 or 2014 due to a procedural change in the handling of partial settlements. Given the anticipated timing of the back settlement, ComEd is pulling forward a previously planned 2013 issuance to fund needs in the interim. At PECO, given the attractive interest rate environment, we are refinancing an incremental $100 million of the  planned debt retirements, bringing total issuance to $350 million. This will also help reduce expected future financing needs.
In June, ExGen completed its planned $775 million debt issuance with solid pricing that compared well to its 2010 debt offering. The 10-year and 30-year priced at 4.25% and 5.6%, respectively, compared to the 4.0% and 5.75% coupon achieved for the 10-year and 30-year offerings in September of 2010. These funds will be used for general purposes of the company, including investment growth. ExGen also announced they completed a private exchange offer for all the outstanding 7.6% senior notes due in 2032. Of the $700 million principal outstanding, more than 63% were tendered in exchange for cash and notes that will expire in 2022 and 2042. Going forward, this debt exchange will lower our annual pretax cash interest expense by approximately $7 million.
And I'm pleased to announce that we are executing on an amended expense strategy for $7 billion in credit facilities, which will enable 3 key benefits. First, we'll extend the tender by 1 year on Exelon Corp.'s, Exelon Generation's and PECO's facility, and by 2 years on BGE's credit facility, resulting in a 2017 maturity for all our facilities. Second, we'll be able to realign the bank group with the combined company, bringing in new banks and ensuring all banks lend to each operating company within the Exelon family. Third, we'll capture current market pricing consistent with what we pay on ComEd's $1 billion credit facility refinanced earlier this year. We expect to close on the amended facilities in August.
Before I open up the call for questions, I want to look ahead to next quarter's earnings. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating earnings in the range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and we remain confident that we will achieve our full year earnings target of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. Our earnings guidance range adequately accounts for the impact of weather and incremental storms incurred in July. Most notably, it reflects $0.03 of incremental storm cost at BGE for the derecho storm. We are confident about achieving our financial targets this year, and there are several factors that give us line of sight on this goal, including our ability to hit synergy targets. 
To date, we've initiated and completed several milestones that will position us to achieve our $500 million run rate O&M savings starting in 2014. Staffing and selection was finalized at the end of June. Contract negotiations are in progress to incorporate our increased scale and scope and vendor contract pricing, and we eliminated an additional portion of our surplus credit facility. And with that, we're ready to take questions."

Before I discuss the Exelon third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the more than 8000 PECO and BGE employees, contractors, mutual assistant workers, who are working around-the-clock to respond to Hurricane Sandy. This devastating storm slammed our Pennsylvania and Maryland service territories with heavy rain, high winds and it's costing historic damage. Many of you know this first hand, being in the New Jersey and New York area. We are grateful to the dedicated men and women in the field who are repairing the damage and restoring service to our customers as quickly and safely as possible. And that's not to mention the thousands of out-of-state contract workers, including our ComEd employees, who have made their way east to assist in the service. We have, today, for those of you in New York, around 50 underground technicians arriving in New York City to assist with the recovery in the underground system there. And we'll continue to keep our folks in the East Coast as well as we can to help in our regions. 
I'd also like to acknowledge the employees that are Mid-Atlantic nuclear plants for effectively preparing for the hurricane and then they worked diligently to respond to the storm, particularly Oyster Creek, which was at the point where the storm came ashore, which felt the greatest impact. Because of their dedication, we are able to resume normal operations. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 2. The third quarter financial performance was very strong for Exelon, particularly at ExGen. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.77, which was well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Based on our financial performance to date, we are revising our 2012 full year earnings guidance range to $2.75 to $2.95 per share. This range incorporates the cost estimates of the impact of the Hurricane Sandy in our service territories, which we have preliminarily forecasted to be around $100 million of incremental O&M expense. We're in the midst of the restoration so that can have a plus or minus 20%, we'll be finalizing it by weekend. 
The merger continues to go very well. We are on track to meet our commitments to various stakeholders, including our shareholders. We expect to achieve the $170 million merger-related O&M synergies in 2012 that we announced at Analyst Day, as well as the $500 million of run rate synergies beginning in 2014. 
In the course of the bottoms up construction of our long-range plan, we have also identified an incremental $50 million of O&M cost reductions, bringing the total synergies to $550 million. As we complete the integration and continue to refine our financial plans, I expect we will identify further cost reduction opportunities.
We've signed a sales agreement for the mandated asset divestiture of Maryland, received work approval for the sale and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We are benefiting from our well matched generation and load footprint as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance, highlighted by the Constellation portfolio optimization success. 
Our integrated operations are seamless, demands working very well together in the merger is working. Jack will provide you with more details about the financial performance, but first let me give you our view on the current market environment and how we assess our overall financial priorities. I'll wrap up with a discussion on the outcome of the rehearing process at ComEd and implications of the ICC's ruling on the pace and scope of future investments. 
So moving to Slide 3. During the quarter, we saw considerable volatility in the power and gas markets. In August, prices declined significantly to levels lower than June 30 prices, which were the basis for our second quarter hedged disclosure. In September, power prices recovered, driven largely by rising gas prices. However, we continue to see a disconnect in heat rates and forward power prices in PJM. 
We recently updated our fundamental analysis, which now indicates that even after the recovery and power prices, there is roughly $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside not being reflected in the prices. The expected upside is a result of plant retirements, higher operating cost for compliance with environmental standards and the continued disconnect between heat rates and gas prices. 
We forecast that approximately 42 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in the Eastern Interconnect by 2016 with over 30 gigawatts of retirement already announced. Other third parties have even higher forecast of retirements. We believe NiHub has the most heat rate upside at the current gas prices we expect to see greater than 1 heat rate point increase over the current market or approximately $6 of upside in 2015 at NiHub prices. 
Given the lower number of retirement in the MATS portion of PGM and less of a disconnect in heat rates, we see an opportunity of approximately $3 per megawatt hour upside in the PJM West hub prices. The 2 primary factors can explain why we're not currently seeing this upside. First, approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in Eastern Interconnect this year and next. As these units come off-line, we expect to see an increase in prices. Second, there is a potential for increased liquidity in 2013 forward prices for the year -- calendar year of 2013 and beyond as load auctions take place with delivery in 2015 and customers procure power in the commercial, industrial and the space. For these reasons, we think we expect the forward curves to reflect the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside during 2013. 
We continue with our traditional ratable hedging but we are executing our Bull Bear Program in this period of volatility to capture the incremental value from a heat rate recovery while ratably locking in cash flows to support the balance sheet. We have flexibility in our program to increase or decrease our hedge within a 10% band of ratable. 
You've seen us exercise this flexibility in the past, where we have hedged at or above ratable and locked in on incremental value. Now we have slowed our hedge activity over the last few quarters from ahead of ratable at the end of 2011 to ratable levels. At this pace, we'll turn below a purely ratable program over the next few quarters absent a power market recovery. However, we will always look to shift our strategy when we see better pricing opportunities. 
We are also leveraging our financial and physical products, such as selling underlying gas and utilizing gas and power options in order to preserve the ability to capture the heat rate expansion when the ultimate pricing -- the price comes back into the market. I've noted that natural gas underlying option hedges less than 10% of our expected generation. 
This portfolio of optimization is a core skill for Constellation. This year we were able to capture considerable value through the portfolio management by optimizing our generation load positions. In ERCOT, large moves in the forward summer heat rates allowed us to sell our peaking generation open link as forward prices rose prior to the summer, and we continue to perform this optimization into the spot market while we manage the load variability. 
In PJM, we saw low falling products that better match our generation through our retail and wholesale channels, reducing basis exposure and capture incremental value for our base generation.
With that backdrop on markets, I'd like now to speak about our latest forecast for retail. As we discussed in updated generation hedged disclosure -- flip to Slide 4. As you heard us discussed in the last month, both the retail and wholesale markets have been impacted by aggressive competition and pricing. We maintained the same disciplined approach to valuing and pricing the risk and full requirements load that has led to success in our portfolio optimization in the past. This approach has resulted in us not winning as many of the recent RFPs in Illinois, certain other competitive procurement in other markets. Our recent experience in the competitive environment has tempered our near to midterm outlook for our retail business. We have adjusted our commercial load expectations as reflected in our updated Exelon generation disclosure from what we presented back at Analyst Day. 
At Analyst Day, we were projecting 20% growth in commercial volumes from 2011 to 2014. Reflecting the current market dynamics, we are now projecting a 9% growth in volumes from 2011 to 2015. We still expect retail to support growth in our commercial business in key channel to market. We also view the current pricing dynamics as unfortunate but a necessary aspect of what we expect to be consolidation of retail providers. This experience also highlights the importance of the ability that we uniquely process to utilize other channels to market to optimize our portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 5. We can discuss the impact of these changes on our ExGen hedged disclosure.  Compared to the second quarter open gross margin improved by $600 million from 2012 to 2014, as power prices increased across the curve. We have continued to hedge and have moved the portfolio back to near ratable. In our PJM baseload regions, we are close to ratable and we have utilized discrete hedging products to preserve the opportunity to benefit from the market realization of our fundamental views that forward market heat rates will move higher. In ERCOT we are slightly behind ratable, leaving room for upside participation in what we believe will be higher spark spreads. 
We are fully hedged in 2012, roughly 90% hedged in 2013, approximately 60% hedged in 2014. We've introduced hedged disclosures for 2015 that we have approximately 20% of our portfolio hedged in that year. We are mostly open in 2016 and highly leveraged to the recovery in power prices as reserve margins tighten. 
During the quarter, we benefited from our balanced load serving and generation portfolio, which is reflected in the $100 million increase in our total gross margin for 2012.
In particular, due to the hot temperatures across the country, we experienced stronger than forecasted wholesale and retail loads, resulting in favorable variances as the majority of our contracts are executed at higher prices. In addition, we leveraged our dispatchable fleet across the country to realize higher margins during this period. 
The impact of the degradation in the retail market can be seen in 2013 and 2014 through the reduction in power new business to go bucket. The decrease of $50 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014 is a combination of both the decrease in volume expectation as well as the lower dollar per megawatt hour margin. 
At our June -- at our Analyst Day in June, we shared that our retail C&I margin average, $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. With the increased competition, we are now seeing those margins at the lower end of this range. As we move into the selling season in the fourth quarter of 2012 and early into 2013, we will gain more insight as to where the margins and the volumes are trending. 
While we're disappointed with these reductions, reduced expectations, history has taught us that discipline is more integral to value sustainment than unfettered growth. So we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment, strive to attract and serve new customers and improve our market share, but we will be remain disciplined in our pricing. 
Before I leave this slide, I want to tie it back to our discussion about the expected upside in the power markets. In the appendix, back on Slide 19, we provided our standard gross margin sensitivities. Hitting that, in 2015, we're only 20% hedged. A $5 move per megawatt hour increase over the current forwards will result in roughly $700 million additional gross margin. In 2016, where we mostly open generation position, this opportunity is approximately $1 billion or roughly $0.70 of earnings per share. If our fundamental view is realized, this is a boost to earnings that is not reflected in our current valuation. 
Now let's talk about our financial priorities and some actions we have taken as a result of the volatility we've seen in the markets to give ourselves some more opportunity. So turning to Slide 6. Our number 1 priority is to remain investment grade across all our registrants. Our investment grade rating is fundamental to the business, given our sizable collateral requirements, our counterparty customer relationships and our significant nuclear capital expenditure. In close proximity of importance, our next financial priority is returning value to the shareholders through our dividend. We understand the importance of the value of the dividend to our shareholders. Our third priority is to invest in growth opportunities, smartly deploy growth capital to value -- to provide value to our shareholders. 
In order to fulfill our top priorities and sustain certain investments which benefit from the anticipated market recovery, we've adjusted our capital spend plans. This is repositioning our capital as 3 key components. First, we are deferring the Limerick standard power upgrade by 4 years. Second, we're deferring the LaSalle EPU by another 2 years. If you remember at Analyst Day, we announced the deferral of LaSalle by an initial 2 years and this will create a 4-year overall deferral. The licensing activities, which is the amendment to approve that power uprate, will continue to be submitted to the by the end of the year. This allows the flexibility to execute the EPU projects when prices recover. 
Lastly, we removed the undesignated renewable spend from our financial plan. In total, we removed roughly $2.3 billion of growth capital from 2012 to 2015 capital plans at Exelon Generation since our Analyst Day disclosures, which meaningfully improves our free cash flow over the period. The deferral of these projects is a matter of better aligning our growth capital spend with the expected timing of the power market recovery. We still believe that these projects add significant value and can earn attract buyers. The long-term -- the long-lived nature of these assets will allow us to deferred the investments and still capture returns in a more balanced sheet friendly manner. 
On Slide 7, we'll provide the comparison of our current ExGen CapEx forecast to what we presented at Analyst Day. So flipping to that -- excuse me, they gave me a long script today. So flipping to Slide 7. You can see the impact of the deferral of Limerick and LaSalle as well as the elimination of the unidentified renewable spend. We're moving forward with the EPU at Peach Bottom as planned. The additional 130 megawatts from this upgrade are expected to come online and generate returns beginning in 2015, resulting in an unlevered IRR on a go forward basis well above 10% across the range of potential price scenarios. We are the farthest along with Peach Bottom, to date, at our ownership level. We have invested $55 million with roughly $360 million of spend planned through 2016. 
In terms of investment dollars, Peach Bottom is the smallest of the 3 upgrades and the size of the investment results in limited strain in the balance sheet. 
You can also see that we are moving forward with our plans for upstream gas. These investments provide strong returns with no impact on credit metrics as calculated by S&P, given the treatment of the reserve base lending facility that is utilized to fund the business.
We view these investments as value creation opportunities for our shareholders that support our strategy but with limited balance sheet impact. 
Now I'll speak to the decisions -- now I'll speak to how these decisions impact our balance sheet and how we think about the dividend going forward. We've maintained a strong balance sheet to help us weather this challenging market. With the expected year-end FFO to debt of 31% in 2012, we are strong heading into 2013. However, these metrics weaken as our higher-priced hedges roll off and we enter into the new hedges at lower prices. 
Based on 9 30 prices and with the deferral of the upgrade and the elimination of the undesignated renewable spend, our FFO to debt at Genco plus HoldCo is more focused -- excuse me, is forecasted to be above the 25 to 27 range for 2014 and '15. We believe that our metrics are sufficient to maintain investment grade ratings, but with the recent market volatility we experience, we have to continue to monitor this. 
We believe the materialization of our fundamental view of power prices will allow us to strengthen our credit metrics and watch the market closely to ensure that we have no structural changes that could impact our fundamental view of the $3 to $6 upside. 
It is, of course, also possible that the power prices will not recover as completely or as rapidly as our fundamental views suggest. In that regard, with the actions we've taken, we have time to see how things well. But if they do not play out favorably in the next 6 months, revisiting our dividend policy will be in the range of options for preserving our investment grade rating that management and the board will need to consider. 
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to speak to the implications of the Illinois Commerce Commission's decision in the rehearing of comments formula rate, which is on Slide 8. 
On October 30, ICC granted comment recovery of the cost of finding its pension but denied the cost of recovery of 2 other key issues, which ComEd appealed in the courts, along with other items previously denied in the ICC May ruling. The adverse ruling on the interest rate and rate base issues impair ComEd's ability to finance long-term investment programs. While we remain committed to fulfilling the promise of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and intend to meet our obligations under the law, we have to be thoughtful about making the investments if we do not have full cost recovery mechanism, as authorized by the legislation. As a result of the ICC decision, ComEd has deferred $450 million of capital expenditures through 2012 -- from 2012 to 2014 to 2015 year. Obviously, that schedule could shift as a result of regulatory legal or legislative developments. At EEI, we'll be providing a more comprehensive update of the ComEd and other utility cap expense forecasted through 2015. 
Given the negative impact of the ICC decision, we believe the decision should be reversed. This will take time. So we'll continue to update you as we work through it and like I said, we'll talk more about this at EEI. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jack, who will speak to our financial performance during the quarter."

As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook. I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GA",751,"Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook. 
I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $1.12 a share in the third quarter of 2011. Beyond the impact of the merger-related share differential and the addition of earnings from the legacy Constellation business, revenue net of fuel at ExGen is the primary difference between 2012 third quarter results and the third quarter prior year. The drivers of lower RNF include lower realized market prices and lower PJM capacity revenue due to the transition to the 2012, 2013 capacity auction clearing prices, which averaged about $36 per megawatt day lower than the 2011, 2012 planning period. 
When comparing our financial results for the quarter with our expectations, we delivered solid results for the quarter and we exceeded our $0.65 to $0.75 of earnings per share expectations. We outperformed our guidance range largely due to favorable RNF at ExGen and tax benefits at PECO and favorable weather at ComEd and PECO. 
ExGen's $0.53 non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter reflected about $0.04 of favorable RNF. This RNF upside is the net of approximately $0.07 of revenues from effective portfolio management optimization by the Constellation team, partially offset by $0.03 due to lower than expected nuclear volumes. Chris already spoke about the source of the portfolio optimization benefit earlier, but I will add that the event driven opportunities such as this are difficult to forecast. When they do arise, having a skilled team that can execute and capture the benefits such as ours is an asset. 
Moving to the utilities. ComEd's non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share for 2012 third quarter includes $0.01 more earnings than expected from favorable weather, driven by the amount of cooling degree days over normal. The number of cooling degree days at ComEd this quarter exceeded normal expectations by nearly 250 degree days or 40%. Likewise, PECO 2012 third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share reflect an additional $0.01 of earnings above our expectations due to weather. PECO's 2012 third quarter results also reflect a larger than estimated benefit from the deductions associated with the tax treatment of repairs for gas distribution assets. We elected and recognized a similar benefit for the treatment of electric transmission and  distribution assets the same time last year. The actual benefit for this item came in higher than our estimate by $0.02. 
BGE's 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings this quarter were completely offset by storm cost. BGE's non-GAAP operating earnings would've been about $0.03 if not for the cost incurred for the direction of the storm in July. Despite BGE's absorption of the storm cost, BGE will still contribute positive earnings to full year consolidated earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our cash from operations projection is up $450 million since the last update. There are several puts and takes to this number summer, but it's largely due to changes in net income and changes in taxes coinciding with the company's annual tax filings. In addition, the latest cash from operations projection includes the updated expected net proceeds from the sale of the Maryland coal assets, as outlined in the 8-K we filed on August 9. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 11 on earnings outlook. On Slide 11, I'd like to provide our updated outlook for 2012. As is typical at this time of year, we are narrowing our guidance range. We've had a few positive developments occur this quarter that warrant us raising the top of our range as well. We now expect 2012 full year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 per share, up from our initial earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. The revised earnings expectations reflect the $0.10 of earnings per share ComEd will record in the fourth quarter to recognize the impact of the commission's rehearing decision issued on October 3. The guidance adjustment also considers the incremental earnings contributed by the favorable RNF at ExGen, offset by our preliminary estimate of storm cost related to Hurricane Sandy. 
So in closing, our next update would be at EEI, where we will refresh much of the information we shared with Analyst Day, including capital expenditure estimates through 2015 and pension contribution expectations. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn the call back over to Chris before we open the line for Q&A."

We've taken the right platform to take the right advantage of what we expect for the power market recovery. Investment-grade ratings and maintaining the dividend are our top priorities. We have options, we have time to maintain these objectives.
To time our investments for the power market recovery and giving us some flexibility, we have repositioned our growth strategy and we deferred certain upgrade projects. We'll also, as we stated, eliminate the undesignated renewable spend. 
Lastly, we remain focused on protecting and creating value -- shareholder value through continue advancement of growth projects at Exelon Utilities, Peach Bottom, Antelope Valley Solar Ranch and upstream gas. 
With that, we will open it up to questions."

Obviously, Jay, we have continued to reiterate that we see heat rate upside in this market that is not being reflected particularly in the '15, '16 timeframe. The volatility in price you've seen this summer largely was driven by a couple of things, natural gas price movements and selling behavior in the marketplace. We have seen some recovery on the back of natural gas prices, but we still have not seen the market reflect what we think is a fundamental shift in the stack based on a retirement of over 40,000 gigawatts coal plants in the '15, '16 timeframe."

So we're on the appeal path. The second path is to try to deal with the commission itself. There is a current rate case in front of the commission that will be resolved by the end of December, and there's some opportunities to deal with it in that case. Then finally, obviously, there's a legislative path. So we view all those paths as options right now. We are talking to all parties and having conversations. I don't think we foreclosed any path, but we'll see what looks like the most opportune path and the one where we can get it done as quickly as possible so we can get back on track with making these investments and creating jobs in the state."

We had put in place matching strategy that reduce the impact on the overall obligation. That current unfunded status, if you look at the pension, is roughly $3.9 billion. That's relative to an end of year '11 of $2.2 billion. And I would say that that growth is despite the fact that we've seen very strong performance on both the equity as well as liability matched elements of our pension assets. As we look forward, as you may know the President has put in place -- or is looking to put in place a policy that allows us to adjust the pension liability and how we fund that. And that would have an impact of pulling forward certain of our expenses and reducing our expenses in out years. This strategy we'll be updating at EEI and we'll be able to walk you through after we issue the Q3 10-Q, the specific details of the impact of that adjustment. But it does result in further funding in the initial years but moderates that funding and reduces it in '16 and '17."

Before I discuss the Exelon third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the more than 8,000 PECO and BGE employees, contractors, mutual assistant workers, who are working around-the-clock to respond to Hurricane Sandy. 
This devastating storm slammed our Pennsylvania and Maryland service territories with heavy rain, high winds and it's causing historic damage. Many of you know this first hand, being in the New Jersey and New York area. We are grateful to the dedicated men and women in the field, who are repairing the damage and restoring service to our customers as quickly and safely as possible. And that's not to mention the thousands of out-of-state contract workers, including our ComEd employees, who have made their way east to assist in the service. 
We have today, for those of you in New York, around 50 underground technicians arriving in New York City to assist with the recovery of the underground system there, and we'll continue to keep our folks on the East Coast as long as we can to help in our regions.
I'd also like to acknowledge the employees that are for -- in Mid-Atlantic nuclear plants for effectively preparing for the hurricane. And then they worked diligently to respond to the storm, particularly Oyster Creek, which was at the point where the storm came ashore, which felt the greatest impact. Because of their dedication, we are able to resume normal operations.
With that, let's turn to Slide 2. The third quarter financial performance was very strong for Exelon, particularly at ExGen. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.77, which was well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Based on our financial performance to date, we are revising our 2012 full year earning guidance range to $2.75 to $2.95 per share. This range incorporates the preliminary cost estimates of the impact of the Hurricane Sandy in our service territories, which we have preliminarily forecasted to be around $100 million of incremental O&M expense. We're in the midst of the restoration, so that could have a plus or minus 20%. We'll be finalizing it by weekend. 
The merger continues to go very well. We are on track to meet our commitments to various stakeholders, including our shareholders. We expect to achieve the $170 million merger-related O&M synergies in 2012 that we announced at Analyst Day, as well as the $500 million of run rate synergies beginning in 2014.
In the course of the bottoms-up construction of our long-range plan, we have also identified an incremental $50 million of O&M cost reductions, bringing the total synergies to $550 million. As we complete the integration and continue to refine our financial plans, I expect we will identify further cost reduction opportunities.
We've signed a sales agreement for the mandated asset divestiture in Maryland, received FERC approval for the sale and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We are benefiting from our well-matched generation and load footprint as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance, highlighted by the Constellation portfolio optimization success. 
Our integrated operations are seamless, the management team is working very well together and the merger is working. Jack will provide you with more detail about the financial performance, but first let me give you our view on the current market environment and how we assess our overall financial priorities. I'll wrap up with a discussion on the outcome of the rehearing process at ComEd and the implications of the ICC's ruling on the pace and scope of future investments.
So moving to Slide 3. During the quarter, we saw considerable volatility in the power and gas markets. In August, prices declined significantly to levels lower than June 30 prices, which were the basis for our second quarter hedged disclosure. In September, power prices recovered, driven largely by rising gas prices. However, we continue to see a disconnect in heat rates and forward power prices in PJM.
We recently updated our fundamental analysis, which now indicates that even after the recovery and power prices, there is roughly $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside not being reflected in the prices. The expected upside is the result of plant retirements, higher operating cost for compliance with environmental standards and a continued disconnect between heat rates and gas prices.
We forecast that approximately 42 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in the Eastern Interconnect by 2016, with over 30 gigawatts of retirement already announced. Other third parties have even higher forecast of retirements. We believe NiHub has the most heat rate upside. At the current gas prices, we expect to see greater than 1 heat rate point increase over the current market or approximately $6 of upside in 2015 at NiHub prices.
Given the lower number of retirements in the MATS portion of PJM and less of a disconnect in heat rates, we see an opportunity of approximately $3 per megawatt hour upside in the PJM West Hub prices. 
The 2 primary factors can explain why we are not currently seeing this upside: First, approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in Eastern Interconnect this year and next. As these units come offline, we expect to see an increase in prices. Second, there is a potential for an increased liquidity in 2013 forward prices for the year -- calendar year of 2015 and beyond, as load auctions take place with delivery in 2015 and customers procure power in the commercial, industrial and the Muni-Ag space. For these reasons, we think we expect the forward curves to reflect the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside during 2013.
We continue with our traditional ratable hedging but we are executing our Bull/Bear program in this period of volatility to capture the incremental value from a heat rate recovery while ratably locking in cash flows to support the balance sheet. We have flexibility in our program to increase or decrease our hedge within a 10% band of ratable.
You've seen us exercise this flexibility in the past, where we have hedged at or above ratable and locked in on incremental value. Now we have slowed our hedge activity over the last few quarters from ahead of ratable at the end of 2011 to ratable levels. At this pace, we will trim below a purely ratable program over the next few quarters, absent a power market recovery. However, we will always look to shift our strategy when we see better pricing opportunities.
We are also leveraging our financial and physical products, such as selling underlying gas and utilizing gas and power options in order to preserve the ability to capture the heat rate expansion when the ultimate pricing -- the price comes back into the market. And note that, that natural gas underlying an option hedge is less than 10% of our expected generation.
This portfolio optimization is a core skill for Constellation. This year we were able to capture considerable value through the portfolio management by optimizing our generation load positions. 
In ERCOT, large moves in the forward summer heat rates allowed us to sell our peaking generation open link as forward prices rose prior to the summer, and we continue to perform this optimization into the spot market while we manage the load variability.
In PJM, we saw low falling products that better match our generation through our retail and wholesale channels, reducing bases exposure and capture incremental value for our base generation.
With that backdrop on markets, I'd like now to speak about our latest forecast for retail. As we discussed our -- in updated generation hedge disclosure, flip to Slide 4. As you heard us discussed in the last month, both the retail and the wholesale markets have been impacted by aggressive competition and pricing. We maintained the same disciplined approach to valuing and pricing the risk and the full requirements load that has led to success in our portfolio optimization in the past. 
This approach has resulted in us not winning as many of the recent Muni-Ag RFPs in Illinois and certain other competitive procurements in other markets. Our recent experience in the competitive environment has tempered our near- to mid-term outlook for our retail business. We have adjusted our commercial load expectations as reflected in our updated Exelon generation disclosure from what we presented back at Analyst Day.
At Analyst Day, we were projecting 20% growth in commercial volumes from 2011 to 2014. Reflecting the current market dynamics, we are now projecting a 9% growth in volumes from 2011 to 2015. We still expect retail to support growth in our commercial business and serve as a key channel to market. We also view the current pricing dynamic as unfortunate but a necessary aspect of what we expect to be consolidation of retail providers. This experience also highlights the importance of the ability that we uniquely possess to utilize other channels to market to optimize our portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. We can discuss the impact of these changes on our ExGen hedge disclosure.  Compared to second quarter open gross margin improved by $600 million from the 2012 to 2014, as power prices increased across the curve. We have continued to hedge and have moved the portfolio back to near ratable. 
In our PJM baseload regions, we are close to ratable and we have utilized discrete hedging products to preserve the opportunity to benefit from the market realization of our fundamental views that forward market heat rates will move higher.
In ERCOT pool, we are slightly behind ratable, leaving room for upside participation in what we believe will be higher spark spreads.
We are fully hedged in 2012, roughly 90% hedged in 2013, approximately 60% hedged in 2014. We've introduced hedge disclosures for 2015 that we have approximately 20% of our portfolio hedged in that year. We are mostly open in 2016 and highly leveraged to the recovery in power prices as reserve margins tighten.
During the quarter, we benefited from our balanced load serving and generation portfolio, which is reflected in the $100 million increase in our total gross margin for 2012.
In particular, due to the hot temperatures across the country, we experienced stronger-than-forecasted wholesale and retail loads, resulting in favorable variances as the majority of our contracts are executed at higher prices. In addition, we leveraged our dispatchable fleet across the country to realize higher margins during this period.
The impact of the degradation in the retail market can be seen in 2013 and 2014 through the reduction in power new business to go bucket. The decrease of $50 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014 is a combination of both a decrease in volume expectation as well as a lower dollar per megawatt hour margin.
At our June -- at our Analyst Day in June, we shared that our retail C&I margin average, $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. With the increased competition, we're now seeing those margins at the lower end of this range. As we move into the selling season in the fourth quarter of 2012 and early into 2013, we will gain more insight as to where the margins and the volumes are trending.
While we're disappointed with these reduction -- reduced expectations, history has taught us that discipline is more integral to value sustainment than unfettered growth. So we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment, strive to attract and serve new customers and improve our market share, but we will be -- remain disciplined in our pricing.
Before we leave this slide, I want to tie it back to our discussion about the expected upside in the power markets. In the appendix, back on Slide 19, we provided our standard gross margin sensitivities. Hitting that, in 2015, we're only 20% hedged. A $5 move per megawatt hour increase over the current forwards will result in roughly $700 million additional gross margin. In 2016, where we're mostly open generation position, this opportunity is approximately $1 billion or roughly $0.70 of earnings per share. If our fundamental view is realized, this is a boost to earnings that is not reflected in our current valuation.
Now let's talk about our financial priorities and some actions we have taken as a result of the volatility we've seen in the markets and to give ourselves some more opportunity. So turning to Slide 6. Our #1 priority is to remain investment grade across all our registrants. Our investment grade rating is fundamental to the business, given our sizable collateral requirements, our counterparty and customer relationships and our significant nuclear capital expenditure. 
In close proximity of importance, our next financial priority is returning value to the shareholders through our dividend. We understand the importance of the value of the dividend to our shareholders. 
Our third priority is to invest in growth opportunities, smartly deploy growth capital to value -- to provide value to our shareholders.
In order to fulfill our top priorities and sustain certain investments, which benefit from the anticipated market recovery, we've adjusted our capital spend plans. This is repositioning our capital as 3 key components. First, we're deferring the Limerick standard power upgrade by 4 years. Second, we're deferring the LaSalle EPU by another 2 years. If you remember at Analyst Day, we announced the deferral of LaSalle by an initial 2 years, and this will create a 4-year overall deferral. The licensing activities, which is the amendment to approve that power uprate, will continue to be submitted to the NRC by the end of the year. This allows the flexibility to execute the EPU projects when prices recover.
Lastly, we removed the undesignated renewable spend from our financial plan. In total, we removed roughly $2.3 billion of growth capital from 2012 to 2015 capital plans at Exelon Generation since our Analyst Day disclosures, which meaningfully improves our free cash flow over the period. 
The deferral of these projects is a matter of better aligning our growth capital spend with the expected timing of the power market recovery. We still believe that these projects add significant value and can earn attractive IRRs. The long-term -- the long-lived nature of these assets will allow us to defer the investment and still capture returns in a more balance sheet friendly manner. 
On Slide 7, we'll provide the comparison of our current ExGen growth CapEx forecast to what we presented at Analyst Day. So flipping to that -- excuse me, they gave me a long script today. So flipping to Slide 7. You can see the impacts of the deferral of Limerick and LaSalle as well as the elimination of the unidentified renewable spend. We're moving forward with the EPU at Peach Bottom as planned. The additional 130 megawatts from this uprate are expected to come online and generate returns beginning in 2015, resulting in an unlevered IRR on a go-forward basis well above 10% across the range of potential price scenarios. 
We are the farthest along with Peach Bottom. To date, at our ownership level, we have invested $55 million with roughly $360 million of spend planned through 2016.
In terms of investment dollars, Peach Bottom is the smallest of the 3 uprates and the size of the investment results in limited strain on the balance sheet.
You can also see that we are moving forward with our plans for upstream gas. These investments provide strong returns with no impact on credit metrics as calculated by S&P, given their treatment of the reserve base lending facility that is utilized to fund the business.
We view these investments as value-creation opportunities for our shareholders that support our strategy but with limited balance sheet impact.
Now I'll speak to the decisions -- now I'll speak to how these decisions impact our balance sheet and how we think about the dividend going forward. We've maintained a strong balance sheet to help us weather this challenging market. With the expected year-end FFO to debt of 31% in 2012, we are strong heading into 2013. However, these metrics weaken as our higher-priced hedges roll off and we enter into the new hedges at lower prices.
Based on 9/30 prices and with the deferral of the uprates and the elimination of the undesignated renewable spend, our FFO to debt at Genco plus HoldCo is more focused -- excuse me, forecasted to be above the 25% to 27% range for 2014 and '15. 
We believe our metrics are sufficient to maintain investment-grade ratings. But with the recent market volatility we experience, we have to continue to monitor this.
We believe the materialization of our fundamental view of power prices will allow us to strengthen our credit matrix and watch the markets closely to ensure that we have no structural changes that could impact our fundamental view of the $3 to $6 upside.
It is, of course, also possible that the power prices will not recover as completely or as rapidly as our fundamental views suggest. In that regard, with the actions we've taken, we have time to see how things play out. But if they do not play out favorably in the next 6 months, revisiting our dividend policy will be in the range of options for preserving our investment-grade rating that management and the board will need to consider.
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to speak to the implications of the Illinois Commerce Commission's decision in the rehearing of ComEd's formula rate, which is on Slide 8.
On October 30, ICC granted ComEd recovery of the cost of funding its pension but denied the cost of recovery of 2 other key issues, which ComEd appealed in the courts, along with other items previously denied in the ICC May ruling. The adverse ruling on the interest rate and rate base issues impair ComEd's ability to finance long-term investment programs. While we remain committed to fulfilling the promise of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and intend to meet our obligations under the law, we have to be thoughtful about making the investments, if we do not have a full cost recovery mechanism, as authorized by the legislation. 
As a result of the ICC decision, ComEd has deferred $450 million of capital expenditure through 2012 -- from 2012 to 2014 to 2015 year. Obviously, that schedule could shift as a result of regulatory legal or legislative developments. At EEI, we'll be providing a more comprehensive update of the ComEd and other utility cap expense forecasted through 2015.
Given the negative impact of the ICC decision, we believe the decision should be reversed. This will take time. So we'll continue to update you as we work through it. And like I said, we'll talk more about this in EEI. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jack, who will speak to our financial performance during the quarter."

As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook.
I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $1.12 a share in the third quarter of 2011. Beyond the impact of the merger-related share differential and the addition of earnings from the legacy Constellation business, revenue net of fuel at ExGen is the primary difference between 2012 third quarter results and the third quarter prior year. The drivers of lower RNF include lower realized market prices and lower PJM capacity revenues due to the transition to the 2012-2013 capacity auction clearing prices, which averaged about $36 per megawatt day lower than the 2011-2012 planning period.
When comparing our financial results for the quarter with our expectations, we delivered solid results for the quarter and we exceeded our $0.65 to $0.75 of earnings per share expectations. We outperformed our guidance range largely due to favorable RNF at ExGen and tax benefits at PECO and favorable weather at ComEd and PECO.
ExGen's $0.53 non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter reflected about $0.04 of favorable RNF. This RNF upside is the net of approximately $0.07 of revenues from effective portfolio management optimization by Ken Cornew's Constellation team, partially offset by $0.03 due to lower-than-expected nuclear volumes. Chris already spoke about the source of the portfolio optimization benefit earlier, but I will add that event-driven opportunities such as this are difficult to forecast. When they do arise, having a skilled team that can execute and capture the benefits such as ours is an asset.
Moving to the utilities. ComEd's non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share for 2012 third quarter includes $0.01 more earnings than expected from favorable weather, driven by the amount of cooling degree-days over normal. The number of cooling degree-days at ComEd this quarter exceeded normal expectations by nearly 250 degree-days or 40%. 
Likewise, PECO 2012 third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share reflect an additional $0.01 of earnings above our expectations due to weather. PECO's 2012 third quarter results also reflect a larger than estimated benefit from the deductions associated with the tax treatment of repairs for gas distribution assets. We elected and recognized a similar benefit for the treatment of electric transmission distribution assets the same time last year. The actual benefit for this item came in higher than our estimate by $0.02.
BGE's 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings this quarter were completely offset by storm cost. BGE's non-GAAP operating earnings would have been about $0.03 if not for the cost incurred for the derecho storm in July. Despite BGE's absorption of the storm cost, BGE will still contribute positive earnings to full year consolidated earnings.
Turning to Slide 10. Our cash from operations projection is up $450 million since the last update. There are several puts and takes to this number, but it's largely due to changes in net income and changes in taxes coinciding with the company's annual tax filings. In addition, the latest cash from operations projection includes the updated expected net proceeds from the sale of the Maryland coal assets, as outlined in the 8-K we filed on August 9.
Now I'll turn to Slide 11 on earnings outlook. On Slide 11, I'd like to provide our updated earnings outlook for 2012. As is typical at this time of year, we are narrowing our guidance range. We've had a few positive developments occur this quarter that warrant us raising the top of our range as well. We now expect 2012 full year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 per share, up from our initial earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. 
The revised earnings expectations reflect the $0.10 of earnings per share ComEd will record in the fourth quarter to recognize the impact of the commission's rehearing decision issued on October 3. The guidance adjustment also considers the incremental earnings contributed by the favorable RNF at ExGen, offset by our preliminary estimate of incremental storm cost related to Hurricane Sandy.
So in closing, our next update would be at EEI, where we will flesh much of the information we shared at Analyst Day, including capital expenditure estimates through 2015 and pension contribution expectations.
That concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris before we open the line for Q&A."

We've had a strong financial performance in 2012, even with the impact of the hurricane. As a result, Jack mentioned, we are increasing our earnings guidance range. While the recent market dynamics do give us concern, I'd restate we believe $3 to $6 per megawatt hour is not priced into the market, and our expectation is that we will see the upside for 2015 and beyond materialize in 2013.
We've taken the right platform to take the right advantage of what we expect for the power market recovery. Investment-grade ratings and maintaining the dividend are our top priorities. We have options, we have time to maintain these objectives.
To time our investments for the power market recovery in giving us some flexibility, we've repositioned our growth strategy and we deferred certain upgrade projects. We'll also, as we stated, eliminate the undesignated renewable spend.
Lastly, we remain focused on protecting and creating value -- shareholder value through continued advancement of growth projects at Exelon utilities, Peach Bottom, Antelope Valley Solar Ranch and upstream gas.
With that, we will open it up to questions."

But if you look at '15 and '16, there's still a buck and change disconnect there. So we haven't seen them strengthen as much on the back end. We saw a lot of volatility in August. It was unbelievable where the numbers were going, we couldn't model them. We want to make sure that we're being very open and clear. We said we wouldn't surprise anybody. If that volatility comes back into the market, we don't see the recovery, you do not want to -- we do not want to be living on the edge, and the edge is 25%. We've been given some flexibility by the rating agencies because they think this is a stress period. But if something structurally change there and you're dealing with a 90% payout on a dividend for a long run and we have to question if we're getting value. You don't want to live on the edge. There is potential volatility, but I think we have time to watch it going into 2013."

We have today, for those of you in New York, around 50 underground technicians arriving in New York City to assist with the recovery of the underground system there, and we'll continue to keep our folks on the East Coast as long as we can to help in all regions.
I'd also like to acknowledge the employees that are for -- in Mid-Atlantic nuclear plants for effectively preparing for the hurricane. And then they worked diligently to respond to the storm, particularly Oyster Creek, which was at the point where the storm came ashore, which felt the greatest impact. Because of their dedication, we are able to resume normal operations.
With that, let's turn to Slide 2. The third quarter financial performance was very strong for Exelon, particularly at ExGen. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.77, which was well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Based on our financial performance to date, we are revising our 2012 full year earning guidance range to $2.75 to $2.95 per share. This range incorporates the preliminary cost estimates of the impact of the Hurricane Sandy in our service territories, which we have preliminarily forecasted to be around $100 million of incremental O&M expense. We're in the midst of the restoration, so that could have a plus or minus 20%. We'll be finalizing it by weekend. 
The merger continues to go very well. We are on track to meet our commitments to various stakeholders, including our shareholders. We expect to achieve the $170 million merger-related O&M synergies in 2012 that we announced at Analyst Day, as well as the $500 million of run rate synergies beginning in 2014.
In the course of the bottoms-up construction of our long-range plan, we have also identified an incremental $50 million of O&M cost reductions, bringing the total synergies to $550 million. As we complete the integration and continue to refine our financial plans, I expect we will identify further cost reduction opportunities.
We've signed a sales agreement for the mandated asset divestiture in Maryland, received FERC approval for the sale and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We are benefiting from our well-matched generation and load footprint as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance, highlighted by the Constellation portfolio optimization success. 
Our integrated operations are seamless, the management team is working very well together and the merger is working. Jack will provide you with more detail about the financial performance, but first let me give you our view on the current market environment and how we assess our overall financial priorities. I'll wrap up with a discussion on the outcome of the rehearing process at ComEd and the implications of the ICC's ruling on the pace and scope of future investments.
So moving to Slide 3. During the quarter, we saw considerable volatility in the power and gas markets. In August, prices declined significantly to levels lower than June 30 prices, which were the basis for our second quarter hedged disclosure. In September, power prices recovered, driven largely by rising gas prices. However, we continue to see a disconnect in heat rates and forward power prices in PJM.
We recently updated our fundamental analysis, which now indicates that even after the recovery and power prices, there is roughly $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside not being reflected in the prices. The expected upside is the result of plant retirements, higher operating cost for compliance with environmental standards and a continued disconnect between heat rates and gas prices.
We forecast that approximately 42 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in the Eastern Interconnect by 2016, with over 30 gigawatts of retirement already announced. Other third parties have even higher forecast of retirements. We believe NiHub has the most heat rate upside. At the current gas prices, we expect to see greater than 1 heat rate point increase over the current market, or approximately $6 of upside in 2015 at NiHub prices.
Given the lower number of retirements in the MATS portion of PJM and less of a disconnect in heat rates, we see an opportunity of approximately $3 per megawatt hour upside in the PJM West Hub prices. 
There are 2 primary factors can explain why we are not currently seeing this upside. First, approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in Eastern Interconnect this year and next. As these units come offline, we expect to see an increase in prices. Second, there is a potential for an increased liquidity in 2013 forward prices for the year -- calendar year of 2015 and beyond, as load auctions take place with delivery in 2015 and customers procure power in the commercial, industrial and the Muni-Ag space. For these reasons, we think we expect the forward curves to reflect the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside during 2013.
We continue with our traditional ratable hedging but we are executing our Bull/Bear program in this period of volatility to capture the incremental value from a heat rate recovery while ratably locking in cash flows to support the balance sheet. We have flexibility in our program to increase or decrease our hedge within a 10% band of ratable.
You've seen us exercise this flexibility in the past, where we have hedged at or above ratable and locked in on incremental value. Now we have slowed our hedge activity over the last few quarters from ahead of ratable at the end of 2011 to ratable levels. At this pace, we will trim below a purely ratable program over the next few quarters, absent a power market recovery. However, we will always look to shift our strategy when we see better pricing opportunities.
We are also leveraging our financial and physical products, such as selling underlying gas and utilizing gas and power options in order to preserve the ability to capture the heat rate expansion when the ultimate pricing -- the price comes back into the market. And note that, that natural gas underlying an option hedge is less than 10% of our expected generation.
This portfolio optimization is a core skill for Constellation. This year we were able to capture considerable value through the portfolio management by optimizing our generation load positions. 
In ERCOT, large moves in the forward summer heat rates allowed us to sell our peaking generation open link as forward prices rose prior to the summer, and we continue to perform this optimization into the spot market while we manage the load variability.
In PJM, we saw low falling products that better match our generation through our retail and wholesale channels, reducing basis exposure and capture incremental value for our base generation.
With that backdrop on markets, I'd like now to speak about our latest forecast for retail. As we discussed our -- in updated generation hedge disclosure, flip to Slide 4. As you heard us discuss in the last month, both the retail and the wholesale markets have been impacted by aggressive competition and pricing. We maintained the same disciplined approach to valuing and pricing the risk and the full requirements load that has led to success in our portfolio optimization in the past. 
This approach has resulted in us not winning as many of the recent Muni-Ag RFPs in Illinois and certain other competitive procurements in other markets. Our recent experience in the competitive environment has tempered our near- to mid-term outlook for our retail business. We have adjusted our commercial load expectations as reflected in our updated Exelon generation disclosure from what we presented back at Analyst Day.
At Analyst Day, we were projecting 20% growth in commercial volumes from 2011 to 2014. Reflecting the current market dynamics, we are now projecting a 9% growth in volumes from 2011 to 2015. We still expect retail to support growth in our commercial business and serve as a key channel to market. We also view the current pricing dynamic as unfortunate, but a necessary aspect of what we expect to be consolidation of retail providers. This experience also highlights the importance of the ability that we uniquely possess to utilize other channels to market to optimize our portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. We can discuss the impact of these changes on our ExGen hedge disclosure.  Compared to second quarter open gross margin improved by $600 million from the 2012 to 2014, as power prices increased across the curve. We have continued to hedge and have moved the portfolio back to near ratable. 
In our PJM baseload regions, we are close to ratable and we have utilized discrete hedging products to preserve the opportunity to benefit from the market realization of our fundamental views that forward market heat rates will move higher.
In ERCOT and NEPOOL, we are slightly behind ratable, leaving room for upside participation in what we believe will be higher spark spreads.
We are fully hedged in 2012, roughly 90% hedged in 2013, approximately 60% hedged in 2014. We've introduced hedge disclosures for 2015 that we have approximately 20% of our portfolio hedged in that year. We are mostly open in 2016 and highly leveraged to the recovery in power prices as reserve margins tighten.
During the quarter, we benefited from our balanced load serving and generation portfolio, which is reflected in the $100 million increase in our total gross margin for 2012.
In particular, due to the hot temperatures across the country, we experienced stronger-than-forecasted wholesale and retail loads, resulting in favorable variances as the majority of our contracts are executed at higher prices. In addition, we leveraged our dispatchable fleet across the country to realize higher margins during this period.
The impact of the degradation in the retail market can be seen in 2013 and 2014 through the reduction in power new business to go bucket. The decrease of $50 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014 is a combination of both a decrease in volume expectation as well as a lower dollar per megawatt hour margin.
At our June -- at our Analyst Day in June, we shared that our retail C&I margin average, $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. With the increased competition, we're now seeing those margins at the lower end of this range. As we move into the selling season in the fourth quarter of 2012 and early into 2013, we will gain more insight as to where the margins and the volumes are trending.
While we're disappointed with these reduction -- reduced expectations, history has taught us that discipline is more integral to value sustainment than unfettered growth. So we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment, strive to attract and serve new customers and improve our market share, but we will be -- remain disciplined in our pricing.
Before we leave this slide, I want to tie it back to our discussion about the expected upside in the power markets. In the appendix, back on Slide 19, we provided our standard gross margin sensitivities. Hitting that, in 2015, we're only 20% hedged. A $5 move per megawatt hour increase over the current forwards will result in roughly $700 million of additional gross margin. In 2016, where we're mostly open generation position, this opportunity is approximately $1 billion or roughly $0.70 of earnings per share. If our fundamental view is realized, this is a boost to earnings that is not reflected in our current valuation.
Now let's talk about our financial priorities and some actions we have taken as a result of the volatility we've seen in the markets and to give ourselves some more opportunity. So turning to Slide 6. Our #1 priority is to remain investment grade across all our registrants. Our investment grade rating is fundamental to the business, given our sizable collateral requirements, our counterparty and customer relationships and our significant nuclear capital expenditure. 
In close proximity of importance, our next financial priority is returning value to the shareholders through our dividend. We understand the importance of the value of the dividend to our shareholders. 
Our third priority is to invest in growth opportunities, smartly deploy growth capital to value -- to provide value to our shareholders.
In order to fulfill our top priorities and sustain certain investments, which benefit from the anticipated market recovery, we've adjusted our capital spend plans. This repositioning of capital has 3 key components. First, we're deferring the Limerick extended power upgrade by 4 years. Second, we're deferring the LaSalle EPU by another 2 years. If you remember at Analyst Day, we announced the deferral of LaSalle by an initial 2 years, and this will create a 4-year overall deferral. The licensing activities, which is the amendment to approve that power upgrade, will continue to be submitted to the NRC by the end of the year. This allows the flexibility to execute the EPU projects when prices recover.
Lastly, we removed the undesignated renewable spend from our financial plan. In total, we removed roughly $2.3 billion of growth capital from 2012 to 2015 capital plans at Exelon Generation since our Analyst Day disclosures, which meaningfully improves our free cash flow over the period. 
The deferral of these projects is a matter of better aligning our growth capital spend with the expected timing of the power market recovery. We still believe that these projects add significant value and can earn attractive IRRs. The long-term -- the long-lived nature of these assets will allow us to defer the investment and still capture returns in a more balance sheet friendly manner. 
On Slide 7, we'll provide the comparison of our current ExGen growth CapEx forecast to what we presented at the Analyst Day. So flipping to that -- excuse me, they gave me a long script today. So flipping to Slide 7. You can see the impacts of the deferral of Limerick and LaSalle as well as the elimination of the unidentified renewable spend. We're moving forward with the EPU at Peach Bottom as planned. The additional 130 megawatts from this upgrade are expected to come online and generate returns beginning in 2015, resulting in an unlevered IRR on a go-forward basis well above 10% across the range of potential price scenarios. 
We are the farthest along with Peach Bottom. To date, at our ownership level, we have invested $55 million, with roughly $360 million of spend planned through 2016.
In terms of investment dollars, Peach Bottom is the smallest of the 3 uprates and the size of the investment results in limited strain on the balance sheet.
You can also see that we are moving forward with our plans for upstream gas. These investments provide strong returns with no impact on credit metrics as calculated by S&P, given their treatment of the reserve base lending facility that is utilized to fund the business.
We view these investments as value-creation opportunities for our shareholders that support our strategy but with limited balance sheet impact.
Now I'll speak to the decisions -- now I'll speak to how these decisions impact our balance sheet and how we think about the dividend going forward. We've maintained a strong balance sheet to help us weather this challenging market. With the expected year-end FFO to debt of 31% in 2012, we are strong heading into 2013. However, these metrics weaken as our higher-priced hedges roll off and we enter into the new hedges at lower prices.
Based on 9/30 prices and with the deferral of the upgrade and the elimination of the undesignated renewable spend, our FFO to debt at Genco plus HoldCo is more focused -- excuse me, forecasted to be above the 25% to 27% range for 2014 and '15. 
We believe our metrics are sufficient to maintain investment-grade ratings. But with the recent market volatility we experience, we have to continue to monitor this.
We believe the materialization of our fundamental view of power prices will allow us to strengthen our credit matrix and watch the markets closely to ensure that we have no structural changes that could impact our fundamental view of the $3 to $6 upside.
It is, of course, also possible that the power prices will not recover as completely or as rapidly as our fundamental views suggest. In that regard, with the actions we've taken, we have time to see how things play out. But if they do not play out favorably in the next 6 months, revisiting our dividend policy will be in the range of options for preserving our investment-grade rating that management and the board will need to consider.
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to speak to the implications of the Illinois Commerce Commission's decision in the rehearing of ComEd's formula rate, which is on Slide 8.
On October 30, ICC granted ComEd recovery of the cost of funding its pension but denied the cost of recovery of 2 other key issues, which ComEd appealed in the courts, along with other items previously denied in the ICC May ruling. The adverse ruling on the interest rate and rate base issues impair ComEd's ability to finance long-term investment programs. While we remain committed to fulfilling the promise of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and intend to meet our obligations under the law, we have to be thoughtful about making the investments, if we do not have a full cost recovery mechanism, as authorized by the legislation. 
As a result of the ICC decision, ComEd has deferred $450 million of capital expenditure through 2012 -- from 2012 to 2014 to 2015 year. Obviously, that schedule could shift as a result of regulatory, legal or legislative developments. At EEI, we'll be providing a more comprehensive update of the ComEd and other utility CapEx spends forecasted through 2015.
Given the negative impact of the ICC decision, we believe the decision should be reversed. This will take time. So we'll continue to update you as we work through it. And like I said, we'll talk more about this in EEI. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jack, who will speak to our financial performance during the quarter."

As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook.I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GA",742,"Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook.
I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $1.12 a share in the third quarter of 2011. Beyond the impact of the merger-related share differential and the addition of earnings from the legacy Constellation business, revenue net of fuel at ExGen is the primary difference between 2012 third quarter results and the third quarter prior year. The drivers of lower RNF include lower realized market prices and lower PJM capacity revenues due to the transition to the 2012-2013 capacity auction clearing prices, which averaged about $36 per megawatt day lower than the 2011-2012 planning period.
When comparing our financial results for the quarter with our expectations, we delivered solid results for the quarter and we exceeded our $0.65 to $0.75 of earnings per share expectations. We outperformed our guidance range largely due to favorable RNF at ExGen and tax benefits at PECO and favorable weather at ComEd and PECO.
ExGen's $0.53 non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter reflected about $0.04 of favorable RNF. This RNF upside is the net of approximately $0.07 of revenues from effective portfolio management optimization by Ken Cornew's Constellation team, partially offset by $0.03 due to lower-than-expected nuclear volumes. Chris already spoke about the source of the portfolio optimization benefit earlier, but I will add that event-driven opportunities such as this are difficult to forecast. When they do arise, having a skilled team that can execute and capture the benefits such as ours is an asset.
Moving to the utilities. ComEd's non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share for 2012 third quarter includes $0.01 more earnings than expected from favorable weather, driven by the amount of cooling degree-days over normal. The number of cooling degree-days at ComEd this quarter exceeded normal expectations by nearly 250 degree-days or 40%. 
Likewise, PECO's 2012 third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share reflect an additional $0.01 of earnings above our expectations due to weather. PECO's 2012 third quarter results also reflect a larger than estimated benefit from the deductions associated with the tax treatment of repairs for gas distribution assets. We elected and recognized a similar benefit for the treatment of electric transmission distribution assets the same time last year. The actual benefit for this item came in higher than our estimate by $0.02.
BGE's 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings this quarter were completely offset by storm cost. BGE's non-GAAP operating earnings would have been about $0.03 if not for the cost incurred for the derecho storm in July. Despite BGE's absorption of the storm cost, BGE will still contribute positive earnings to full year consolidated earnings.
Turning to Slide 10. Our cash from operations projection is up $450 million since the last update. There are several puts and takes to this number, but it's largely due to changes in net income and changes in taxes coinciding with the company's annual tax filings. In addition, the latest cash from operations projection includes the updated expected net proceeds from the sale of the Maryland coal assets, as outlined in the 8-K we filed on August 9.
Now I'll turn to Slide 11 on earnings outlook. On Slide 11, I'd like to provide our updated earnings outlook for 2012. As is typical at this time of year, we are narrowing our guidance range. We've had a few positive developments occur this quarter that warrant us raising the top of our range as well. We now expect 2012 full year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 per share, up from our initial earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. 
The revised earnings expectations reflect the $0.10 of earnings per share ComEd will record in the fourth quarter to recognize the impact of the commission's rehearing decision issued on October 3. The guidance adjustment also considers the incremental earnings contributed by the favorable RNF at ExGen, offset by our preliminary estimate of incremental storm cost related to Hurricane Sandy.
So in closing, our next update would be at EEI, where we will refresh much of the information we shared at Analyst Day, including capital expenditure estimates through 2015 and pension contribution expectations.
That concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris before we open the line for Q&A."

We've taken the right platform to take the right advantage of what we expect for the power market recovery. Investment-grade ratings and maintaining the dividend are our top priorities. We have options, we have time to maintain these objectives.
To time our investments for the power market recovery in giving us some flexibility, we've repositioned our growth strategy and we deferred certain upgrade projects. We'll also, as we stated, eliminate the undesignated renewable spend.
Lastly, we remain focused on protecting and creating value -- shareholder value through continued advancement of growth projects at Exelon utilities, Peach Bottom, Antelope Valley Solar Ranch and upstream gas.
With that, we will open it up to questions."

So Jonathan, as you might expect, with the declining interest rates, the liability has grown. Importantly, under Doug Brown, who heads up our investments organization under Bill, we had put in place a liability matching strategy that reduced the impact on the overall obligation. That current unfunded status, if you look at the pension, is roughly $3.9 billion. That's relative to an end of year '11 of $2.2 billion. And I would say that, that growth is despite the fact that we've seen a very strong performance on both the equity, as well as the liability matched elements of our pension assets. As we look forward, as you may know, the President has put in place a -- or is looking to put in place a policy that allows us to adjust the pension liability and how we fund that. And that would have the impact of pulling forward certain of our expenses and reducing our expenses in out years. This strategy, we'll be updating at EEI, and we'll be able to walk you through after we've issued the Q3 10-Q, the specific details of the impact of that adjustment.

Before I discuss the Exelon third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the more than 8,000 PECO and BGE employees, contractors, mutual assistant workers, who are working around-the-clock to respond to Hurricane Sandy. 
This devastating storm slammed our Pennsylvania and Maryland service territories with heavy rain, high winds and is causing historic damage. Many of you know this firsthand, being in the New Jersey and New York area. We are grateful to the dedicated men and women in the field, who are repairing the damage and restoring service to our customers as quickly and safely as possible. And that's not to mention the thousands of out-of-state contract workers, including our ComEd employees, who have made their way east to assist in the service. 
We have today, for those of you in New York, around 50 underground technicians arriving in New York City to assist with the recovery of the underground system there, and we'll continue to keep our folks on the East Coast as long as we can to help in all regions.
I'd also like to acknowledge the employees that are for -- in Mid-Atlantic nuclear plants for effectively preparing for the hurricane. And then they worked diligently to respond to the storm, particularly Oyster Creek, which was at the point where the storm came ashore, which felt the greatest impact. Because of their dedication, we are able to resume normal operations.
With that, let's turn to Slide 2. The third quarter financial performance was very strong for Exelon, particularly at ExGen. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.77, which was well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Based on our financial performance to date, we are revising our 2012 full year earning guidance range to $2.75 to $2.95 per share. This range incorporates the preliminary cost estimates of the impact of the Hurricane Sandy in our service territories, which we have preliminarily forecasted to be around $100 million of incremental O&M expense. We're in the midst of the restoration, so that could have a plus or minus 20%. We'll be finalizing it by weekend. 
The merger continues to go very well. We are on track to meet our commitments to various stakeholders, including our shareholders. We expect to achieve the $170 million merger-related O&M synergies in 2012 that we announced at Analyst Day, as well as the $500 million of run rate synergies beginning in 2014.
In the course of the bottoms-up construction of our long-range plan, we have also identified an incremental $50 million of O&M cost reductions, bringing the total synergies to $550 million. As we complete the integration and continue to refine our financial plans, I expect we will identify further cost reduction opportunities.
We've signed a sales agreement for the mandated asset divestiture in Maryland, received FERC approval for the sale and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We are benefiting from our well-matched generation and load footprint as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance, highlighted by the Constellation portfolio optimization success. 
Our integrated operations are seamless, the management team is working very well together and the merger is working. Jack will provide you with more detail about the financial performance, but first let me give you our view on the current market environment and how we assess our overall financial priorities. I'll wrap up with a discussion on the outcome of the rehearing process at ComEd and the implications of the ICC's ruling on the pace and scope of future investments.
So moving to Slide 3. During the quarter, we saw considerable volatility in the power and gas markets. In August, prices declined significantly to levels lower than June 30 prices, which were the basis for our second quarter hedged disclosure. In September, power prices recovered, driven largely by rising gas prices. However, we continue to see a disconnect in heat rates and forward power prices in PJM.
We recently updated our fundamental analysis, which now indicates that even after the recovery and power prices, there is roughly $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside not being reflected in the prices. The expected upside is the result of plant retirements, higher operating cost for compliance with environmental standards and a continued disconnect between heat rates and gas prices.
We forecast that approximately 42 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in the Eastern Interconnect by 2016, with over 30 gigawatts of retirement already announced. Other third parties have even higher forecast of retirements. We believe NiHub has the most heat rate upside. At the current gas prices, we expect to see greater than 1 heat rate point increase over the current market, or approximately $6 of upside in 2015 at NiHub prices.
Given the lower number of retirements in the MATS portion of PJM and less of a disconnect in heat rates, we see an opportunity of approximately $3 per megawatt hour upside in the PJM West Hub prices. 
There are 2 primary factors can explain why we are not currently seeing this upside. First, approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in Eastern Interconnect this year and next. As these units come offline, we expect to see an increase in prices. Second, there is a potential for an increased liquidity in 2013 forward prices for the year -- calendar year of 2015 and beyond, as load auctions take place with delivery in 2015 and customers procure power in the commercial, industrial and the Muni-Ag space. For these reasons, we think we expect the forward curves to reflect the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside during 2013.
We continue with our traditional ratable hedging but we are executing our Bull/Bear program in this period of volatility to capture the incremental value from a heat rate recovery while ratably locking in cash flows to support the balance sheet. We have flexibility in our program to increase or decrease our hedge within a 10% band of ratable.
You've seen us exercise this flexibility in the past, where we have hedged at or above ratable and locked in on incremental value. Now we have slowed our hedge activity over the last few quarters from ahead of ratable at the end of 2011 to ratable levels. At this pace, we will trim below a purely ratable program over the next few quarters, absent a power market recovery. However, we will always look to shift our strategy when we see better pricing opportunities.
We are also leveraging our financial and physical products, such as selling underlying gas and utilizing gas and power options in order to preserve the ability to capture the heat rate expansion when the ultimate pricing -- the price comes back into the market. And note that, that natural gas underlying an option hedge is less than 10% of our expected generation.
This portfolio optimization is a core skill for Constellation. This year we were able to capture considerable value through the portfolio management by optimizing our generation load positions. 
In ERCOT, large moves in the forward summer heat rates allowed us to sell our peaking generation open link as forward prices rose prior to the summer, and we continue to perform this optimization into the spot market while we manage the load variability.
In PJM, we saw low falling products that better match our generation through our retail and wholesale channels, reducing basis exposure and capture incremental value for our base generation.
With that backdrop on markets, I'd like now to speak about our latest forecast for retail. As we discussed our -- in updated generation hedge disclosure, flip to Slide 4. As you heard us discuss in the last month, both the retail and the wholesale markets have been impacted by aggressive competition and pricing. We maintained the same disciplined approach to valuing and pricing the risk and the full requirements load that has led to success in our portfolio optimization in the past. 
This approach has resulted in us not winning as many of the recent Muni-Ag RFPs in Illinois and certain other competitive procurements in other markets. Our recent experience in the competitive environment has tempered our near- to mid-term outlook for our retail business. We have adjusted our commercial load expectations as reflected in our updated Exelon generation disclosure from what we presented back at Analyst Day.
At Analyst Day, we were projecting 20% growth in commercial volumes from 2011 to 2014. Reflecting the current market dynamics, we are now projecting a 9% growth in volumes from 2011 to 2015. We still expect retail to support growth in our commercial business and serve as a key channel to market. We also view the current pricing dynamic as unfortunate, but a necessary aspect of what we expect to be consolidation of retail providers. This experience also highlights the importance of the ability that we uniquely possess to utilize other channels to market to optimize our portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. We can discuss the impact of these changes on our ExGen hedge disclosure.  Compared to second quarter open gross margin improved by $600 million from the 2012 to 2014, as power prices increased across the curve. We have continued to hedge and have moved the portfolio back to near ratable. 
In our PJM baseload regions, we are close to ratable and we have utilized discrete hedging products to preserve the opportunity to benefit from the market realization of our fundamental views that forward market heat rates will move higher.
In ERCOT and NEPOOL, we are slightly behind ratable, leaving room for upside participation in what we believe will be higher spark spreads.
We are fully hedged in 2012, roughly 90% hedged in 2013, approximately 60% hedged in 2014. We've introduced hedge disclosures for 2015 that we have approximately 20% of our portfolio hedged in that year. We are mostly open in 2016 and highly leveraged to the recovery in power prices as reserve margins tighten.
During the quarter, we benefited from our balanced load serving and generation portfolio, which is reflected in the $100 million increase in our total gross margin for 2012.
In particular, due to the hot temperatures across the country, we experienced stronger-than-forecasted wholesale and retail loads, resulting in favorable variances as the majority of our contracts are executed at higher prices. In addition, we leveraged our dispatchable fleet across the country to realize higher margins during this period.
The impact of the degradation in the retail market can be seen in 2013 and 2014 through the reduction in power new business to go bucket. The decrease of $50 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014 is a combination of both a decrease in volume expectation as well as a lower dollar per megawatt hour margin.
At our June -- at our Analyst Day in June, we shared that our retail C&I margin average, $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. With the increased competition, we're now seeing those margins at the lower end of this range. As we move into the selling season in the fourth quarter of 2012 and early into 2013, we will gain more insight as to where the margins and the volumes are trending.
While we're disappointed with these reduction -- reduced expectations, history has taught us that discipline is more integral to value sustainment than unfettered growth. So we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment, strive to attract and serve new customers and improve our market share, but we will be -- remain disciplined in our pricing.
Before we leave this slide, I want to tie it back to our discussion about the expected upside in the power markets. In the appendix, back on Slide 19, we provided our standard gross margin sensitivities. Hitting that, in 2015, we're only 20% hedged. A $5 move per megawatt hour increase over the current forwards will result in roughly $700 million of additional gross margin. In 2016, where we're mostly open generation position, this opportunity is approximately $1 billion or roughly $0.70 of earnings per share. If our fundamental view is realized, this is a boost to earnings that is not reflected in our current valuation.
Now let's talk about our financial priorities and some actions we have taken as a result of the volatility we've seen in the markets and to give ourselves some more opportunity. So turning to Slide 6. Our #1 priority is to remain investment grade across all our registrants. Our investment grade rating is fundamental to the business, given our sizable collateral requirements, our counterparty and customer relationships and our significant nuclear capital expenditure. 
In close proximity of importance, our next financial priority is returning value to the shareholders through our dividend. We understand the importance of the value of the dividend to our shareholders. 
Our third priority is to invest in growth opportunities, smartly deploy growth capital to value -- to provide value to our shareholders.
In order to fulfill our top priorities and sustain certain investments, which benefit from the anticipated market recovery, we've adjusted our capital spend plans. This repositioning of capital has 3 key components. First, we're deferring the Limerick extended power upgrade by 4 years. Second, we're deferring the LaSalle EPU by another 2 years. If you remember at Analyst Day, we announced the deferral of LaSalle by an initial 2 years, and this will create a 4-year overall deferral. The licensing activities, which is the amendment to approve that power uprate, will continue to be submitted to the NRC by the end of the year. This allows the flexibility to execute the EPU projects when prices recover.
Lastly, we removed the undesignated renewable spend from our financial plan. In total, we removed roughly $2.3 billion of growth capital from 2012 to 2015 capital plans at Exelon Generation since our Analyst Day disclosures, which meaningfully improves our free cash flow over the period. 
The deferral of these projects is a matter of better aligning our growth capital spend with the expected timing of the power market recovery. We still believe that these projects add significant value and can earn attractive IRRs. The long-term -- the long-lived nature of these assets will allow us to defer the investment and still capture returns in a more balance sheet friendly manner. 
On Slide 7, we'll provide the comparison of our current ExGen growth CapEx forecast to what we presented at the Analyst Day. So flipping to that -- excuse me, they gave me a long script today. So flipping to Slide 7. You can see the impacts of the deferral of Limerick and LaSalle as well as the elimination of the unidentified renewable spend. We're moving forward with the EPU at Peach Bottom as planned. The additional 130 megawatts from this upgrate are expected to come online and generate returns beginning in 2015, resulting in an unlevered IRR on a go-forward basis well above 10% across the range of potential price scenarios. 
We are the farthest along with Peach Bottom. To date, at our ownership level, we have invested $55 million, with roughly $360 million of spend planned through 2016.
In terms of investment dollars, Peach Bottom is the smallest of the 3 uprates and the size of the investment results in limited strain on the balance sheet.
You can also see that we are moving forward with our plans for upstream gas. These investments provide strong returns with no impact on credit metrics as calculated by S&P, given their treatment of the reserve base lending facility that is utilized to fund the business.
We view these investments as value-creation opportunities for our shareholders that support our strategy but with limited balance sheet impact.
Now I'll speak to the decisions -- now I'll speak to how these decisions impact our balance sheet and how we think about the dividend going forward. We've maintained a strong balance sheet to help us weather this challenging market. With the expected year-end FFO to debt of 31% in 2012, we are strong heading into 2013. However, these metrics weaken as our higher-priced hedges roll off and we enter into the new hedges at lower prices.
Based on 9/30 prices and with the deferral of the upgrade and the elimination of the undesignated renewable spend, our FFO to debt at Genco plus HoldCo is more focused -- excuse me, forecasted to be above the 25% to 27% range for 2014 and '15. 
We believe our metrics are sufficient to maintain investment-grade ratings. But with the recent market volatility we experience, we have to continue to monitor this.
We believe the materialization of our fundamental view of power prices will allow us to strengthen our credit matrix and watch the markets closely to ensure that we have no structural changes that could impact our fundamental view of the $3 to $6 upside.
It is, of course, also possible that the power prices will not recover as completely or as rapidly as our fundamental views suggest. In that regard, with the actions we've taken, we have time to see how things play out. But if they do not play out favorably in the next 6 months, revisiting our dividend policy will be in the range of options for preserving our investment-grade rating that management and the board will need to consider.
Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to speak to the implications of the Illinois Commerce Commission's decision in the rehearing of ComEd's formula rate, which is on Slide 8.
On October 30, ICC granted ComEd recovery of the cost of funding its pension but denied the cost of recovery of 2 other key issues, which ComEd appealed in the courts, along with other items previously denied in the ICC May ruling. The adverse ruling on the interest rate and rate base issues impair ComEd's ability to finance long-term investment programs. While we remain committed to fulfilling the promise of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and intend to meet our obligations under the law, we have to be thoughtful about making the investments, if we do not have a full cost recovery mechanism, as authorized by the legislation. 
As a result of the ICC decision, ComEd has deferred $450 million of capital expenditure through 2012 -- from 2012 to 2014 to 2015 year. Obviously, that schedule could shift as a result of regulatory, legal or legislative developments. At EEI, we'll be providing a more comprehensive update of the ComEd and other utility CapEx spends forecasted through 2015.
Given the negative impact of the ICC decision, we believe the decision should be reversed. This will take time. So we'll continue to update you as we work through it. And like I said, we'll talk more about this in EEI. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jack, who will speak to our financial performance during the quarter."
296181,222667370,391407,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook.I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GA",742,"Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook.
I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $1.12 a share in the third quarter of 2011. Beyond the impact of the merger-related share differential and the addition of earnings from the legacy Constellation business, revenue net of fuel at ExGen is the primary difference between 2012 third quarter results and the third quarter prior year. The drivers of lower RNF include lower realized market prices and lower PJM capacity revenues due to the transition to the 2012-2013 capacity auction clearing prices, which averaged about $36 per megawatt day lower than the 2011-2012 planning period.
When comparing our financial results for the quarter with our expectations, we delivered solid results for the quarter and we exceeded our $0.65 to $0.75 of earnings per share expectations. We outperformed our guidance range largely due to favorable RNF at ExGen and tax benefits at PECO and favorable weather at ComEd and PECO.
ExGen's $0.53 non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter reflected about $0.04 of favorable RNF. This RNF upside is the net of approximately $0.07 of revenues from effective portfolio management optimization by Ken Cornew's Constellation team, partially offset by $0.03 due to lower-than-expected nuclear volumes. Chris already spoke about the source of the portfolio optimization benefit earlier, but I will add that event-driven opportunities such as this are difficult to forecast. When they do arise, having a skilled team that can execute and capture the benefits such as ours is an asset.
Moving to the utilities. ComEd's non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share for 2012 third quarter includes $0.01 more earnings than expected from favorable weather, driven by the amount of cooling degree-days over normal. The number of cooling degree-days at ComEd this quarter exceeded normal expectations by nearly 250 degree-days or 40%. 
Likewise, PECO's 2012 third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share reflect an additional $0.01 of earnings above our expectations due to weather. PECO's 2012 third quarter results also reflect a larger than estimated benefit from the deductions associated with the tax treatment of repairs for gas distribution assets. We elected and recognized a similar benefit for the treatment of electric transmission distribution assets the same time last year. The actual benefit for this item came in higher than our estimate by $0.02.
BGE's 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings this quarter were completely offset by storm cost. BGE's non-GAAP operating earnings would have been about $0.03 if not for the cost incurred for the derecho storm in July. Despite BGE's absorption of the storm cost, BGE will still contribute positive earnings to full year consolidated earnings.
Turning to Slide 10. Our cash from operations projection is up $450 million since the last update. There are several puts and takes to this number, but it's largely due to changes in net income and changes in taxes coinciding with the company's annual tax filings. In addition, the latest cash from operations projection includes the updated expected net proceeds from the sale of the Maryland coal assets, as outlined in the 8-K we filed on August 9.
Now I'll turn to Slide 11 on earnings outlook. On Slide 11, I'd like to provide our updated earnings outlook for 2012. As is typical at this time of year, we are narrowing our guidance range. We've had a few positive developments occur this quarter that warrant us raising the top of our range as well. We now expect 2012 full year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 per share, up from our initial earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. 
The revised earnings expectations reflect the $0.10 of earnings per share ComEd will record in the fourth quarter to recognize the impact of the commission's rehearing decision issued on October 3. The guidance adjustment also considers the incremental earnings contributed by the favorable RNF at ExGen, offset by our preliminary estimate of incremental storm cost related to Hurricane Sandy.
So in closing, our next update would be at EEI, where we will refresh much of the information we shared at Analyst Day, including capital expenditure estimates through 2015 and pension contribution expectations.
That concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris before we open the line for Q&A."

While the recent market dynamics do give us concern, I'd restate we believe $3 to $6 per megawatt hour is not priced into the market, and our expectation is that we will see the upside for 2015 and beyond materialize in 2013.
We've taken the right platform to take the right advantage of what we expect for the power market recovery. Investment-grade ratings and maintaining the dividend are our top priorities. We have options, we have time to maintain these objectives.
To time our investments for the power market recovery in giving us some flexibility, we've repositioned our growth strategy and we deferred certain upgrade projects. We'll also, as we stated, eliminate the undesignated renewable spend.
Lastly, we remain focused on protecting and creating value -- shareholder value through continued advancement of growth projects at Exelon utilities, Peach Bottom, Antelope Valley Solar Ranch and upstream gas.
With that, we will open it up to questions."

But if you look at '15 and '16, there's still a buck and change disconnect there. So we haven't seen them strengthen as much on the back end. We saw a lot of volatility in August. It was unbelievable where the numbers were going, we couldn't model them. We want to make sure that we're being very open and clear. We said we wouldn't surprise anybody. If that volatility comes back into the market, we don't see the recovery, you do not want to -- we do not want to be living on the edge, and the edge is 25%. We've been given some flexibility by the rating agencies because they think this is a stress period. But if something structurally change there and you're dealing with a 90% payout on a dividend for a long run and we have to question if we're getting value. You don't want to live on the edge. There is potential volatility, but I think we have time to watch it going into 2013."

So Jonathan, as you might expect, with the declining interest rates, the liability has grown. Importantly, under Doug Brown, who heads up our investments organization under Bill, we had put in place a liability matching strategy that reduced the impact on the overall obligation.

And I would say that, that growth is despite the fact that we've seen a very strong performance on both the equity, as well as the liability matched elements of our pension assets. As we look forward, as you may know, the President has put in place a -- or is looking to put in place a policy that allows us to adjust the pension liability and how we fund that.
