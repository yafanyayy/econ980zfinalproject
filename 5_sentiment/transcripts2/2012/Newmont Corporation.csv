We are continu",1066,"Thanks, John. For those of you the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are continuing to make progress on the strategy we discussed with you at April Investor Day last year. We discussed delivering competitive growth and returns, unlocking our exploration upside, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders through a gold link dividend. And while strategies set the future, execution sets the base. So as we've been saying since 2007, everything at Newmont begins with execution. Good performance in our operations allows us to do many things. And in 2011, we delivered again on our original expectation and outlook for the year. Gary Goldberg will talk more about that in a moment. 
Also, in 2011, we took tangible steps to move our project pipeline forward. In particular, we announced initiation of construction of Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami Shaft in Australia, which Guy Lansdown will speak to later in the presentation. And as we have said, competitive difference do require capital discipline. And from time to time, this means that not every project makes it to the next stage of development, and Hope Bay is such a project. And Russell will speak about the financial statement impacts of removing Hope Bay from our development pipeline later in the presentation. 
With respect to the exploration upside, we had a successful year and delivered on our exploration program. As you saw yesterday, we announced year-end reserves of 99 ounces of gold and nearly 10 billion pounds of copper. To put this in perspective, by year-end 2011, with 5.3 million ounces of net additions, that net additions exceeded the sum of the net reserve additions published by the other 4 North American senior gold companies combined. So for the near term, our exploration team is focusing on numerous opportunities, 1 of which is Long Canyon, Nevada, and Guy will provide you more information on that momentarily. 
I'd just like to mention another exploration opportunity because Gary Goldberg and I just recently returned from Indonesia where we were briefed on progress at the Elang exploration project, where we have 2 drill sites working already, and we are adding a third. This is a longer-term perspective opportunity for Newmont which is a large copper gold porphyry with similarities to our Batu Hijau project. And its projects like Long Canyon and like Elang, that underpin our belief that we can continue to deliver reserve additions through the drillbit that will, over time, allow us to discover the Newmont behind Newmont. 
We will pursue our new projects and continue to explore and fund our exploration and development program and return capital to shareholders. We can do all of that because we have a strong base of operating cash flows and a very strong balance sheet. In 2011, to our gold link, we paid out nearly $0.5 billion in dividends or $1 per share, equating to only 23% of our adjusted net income. And as you know, we designed our gold link dividend to enhance investors' leverage to gold ties, and it delivers. Since we announced the enhanced gold link dividend, Newmont's share performance was more closely correlated to the gold price than any of our peers. 
But delivering on our strong strategy and maintaining our track record of operational execution, all of that underpins the success of this company and we can only accomplish that through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, contractors and business partners across Newmont. And I want to thank all of those people for their efforts throughout 2011. But I also know that human capital strategy is important for the future, and continuing to be able to retain our existing employees and attract some of the best expertise in the industry is important to our future as well. And I would just like to acknowledge 1 example of that in Gary Goldberg who recently joined us. Gary joined us in December as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will speak in a little bit. He was most recently President and CEO of Rio Tinto Minerals and is a past Chairman of the national Mining Association. Gary brings to us 30 years of experience in the mining business and is responsible now for Newmont's worldwide mining operations, health and safety, business excellence and security. Looking forward to having Gary's contributions at Newmont for some time to come. 
Turning to Slide 4, you'll see an update of the growth project pipeline that we originally communicated to you last April at Investor Day. As you can see, our North American and Africa regions each have the potential to contribute approximately 800,000 ounces of annual production growth while our South America projects, both in Peru and Suriname, collectively have the potential to contribute 1.25 million ounces of annual production growth. You'll also see in the yellow box around South America that we have updated our forecast here to allow the indication that we've seen recent activities in Peru. So on November 30, we indicated that we had suspended operations at the Conga Project, in agreement with the government of Peru. On December 27, the government announced its intention to have a third party rereview Congress environmental impact assessment, a process that they indicated would take about 40 days. On February 17, the government announced the panel of experts that had been retained to conduct this review. At this time, it's still our intention to develop the 3 projects denoted in yellow on this slide, which include Conga, Cerro Quilish and the Yanacocha expansions. We're encouraged that the EIA review of Conga is underway and we look forward to hearing the results in the near future. 
However, as we stated back in November, should we be and able to continue with our current development plans at Conga, the scale and diversity of Newmont's global portfolio provides us with flexibility to reprioritize and reallocate capital to maintain our focus on delivering our strategic objectives through potential development alternatives with alternatives in Nevada, Ghana, Australia and Indonesia. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, and to discuss our full year financial and operating results."

As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nat",1530,"Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nature of our business. For 2011, we generated record revenue of $10.4 billion, adjusted net income of $2.2 billion or about approximately $4.39 a share and record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, clearly benefiting from continued delivery and execution of the business plan and a strong gold price environment. Gold operating margins increased 32% to $971 an ounce despite a 22% increase in operating costs. 
As outlined at our Investor Day last April, the operating cash flow has been and continues to be redeployed back in the core gold business to aggressive development of our project pipeline into the cash acquisition of Fronteer Gold last April, an acquisition that I believe will have significant long-term value for our shareholders, to fund increased near mine and greenfield exploration. And as Richard mentioned, in line with our gold price link dividend, we returned $1 a share or approximately $500 million to our shareholders last year. 
In addition, we have significantly deleveraged the balance sheet over the past 26 months, with debt repayments of $430 million in 2010, $265 million in 2011 and as described in the subsequent event note in our recently filed Form 10-K, almost $800 million in the first 2 months of this year. We continue to evaluate our capital structure, and with net debt at year end of only $2.5 billion and a liquid marketable securities portfolio, with approximately $1.5 billion at year end, we have significant flexibility to add long-term debt without impacting our current investment grade ratings, especially in light of the current favorable interest rate environment. 
Turning briefly to the fourth quarter, production and costs were largely in line with our expectations. Although as you will no doubt have seen, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax impairment in regard to the Hope Bay project, which I will cover in more detail shortly. Adjusted net income of $1.17 a share was roughly $0.10 short of consensus, of which $0.07 can be explained by an increase in concentrate inventory on hand at Boddington in Australia due to some shipping constraints in late December. This increase was simply a timing difference and that inventory was sold early in the first quarter. This is a long-term business and quarterly inventory fluctuations of up to 50,000 ounces are not uncommon trust especially at operations where we are shipping concentrate as opposed to doré. In addition, the spending on exploration and advanced projects was back-end weighted and we played a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter and that's reflected in our earnings per share. We also realized $1,670 an ounce versus I think the LME average for the quarter of $1,683. Almost all of this is attributable to the pricing of our concentrated sales shipments, which effectively priced over a rolling 3 month-period from shipments as opposed to doré which is essentially prices overnight. 
Moving to Slide 6, you'll see that our operating performance for 2011 was in line with our original outlook from last February. Attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces was right in the middle of our range, although down by 4% from a year ago due to less phase by an oil mine at Batu Hijau resulting in a treatment of lower grade stockpiles and also lower leach oil placement in the Yanacocha. This was partially offset by higher production at North America and Ghana in Africa. 
Gold cost applicable to sales of $5.91 an ounce was $1 above the high-end of our original outlook and I will go into that in little more detail on the following slide. Attributable copper production was on target, although down significant from last year at Batu Hijau for the reasons discussed previously. Copper production at Boddington increased 21% over 2011. Copper CAS of $1.26 a pound was at the low end of our original outlook, resulting largely from the relative outperformance of gold versus copper and the corresponding lower allocation of operating costs to copper revenue. Copper CAS was up substantially from 2010 in light of the phase and stripping campaign at Batu Hijau which will continue until the end of 2013. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on cost applicable to sales on a per-ounce basis for 2011 through a waterfall from the original budget of $5.72 an ounce to the reported $5.91 an ounce. As reflected on the chart, the stronger Australian dollar added $18 an ounce, although this was offset by $9 an ounce in all the currency hedge gains. The relative outperformance of gold over copper added $11 an ounce to our gold CAS due to coproduct accounting for costs at Boddington and Batu Hijau. 
The higher-than-budgeted gold price added $7 an ounce in high royalties and workers participation. As I've commented in previous calls, we're more than happy to be these incremental costs given the significant related management expansion. On the positive side of the equation, higher byproduct credits, primarily  silver for us, reduced CAS by $8 an ounce and our reallocation of certain mining related taxes from CAS to the income tax expense line due to CAS by a further $7 an ounce. Adjusting our reported CAS solely for the impact of the stronger relative performance of gold over copper and higher-than-budgeted gold price, resulted in an adjusted cost applicable to sales of $5.73 an ounce, just below the midpoint of our original outlook from a year ago. It should also be borne in mine that our costs are reported under U.S. GAAP which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to some of the costs calculated under IFRS due to the different accounting treatment for deferred stripping in stockpiles in particular. 
Looking at the table on the right, on Slide 7, net income for the $366 million was impacted by the following: a noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $2.1 billion on a pretax basis; a $1.6 million on an after-tax basis related to our Hope Bay project in Canada. We made a decision in January to close Hope Bay on care and maintenance after evaluating numerous development options against other opportunities in our portfolio. At the end of the day, our desire to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital versus simply producing ounces for ounces' sake drove us to put the project in care and maintenance and reallocate capital to higher return in projects in the portfolio. The right hand had no effect on cash flow or reserves and Hope Bay was not included in the company's 2017 strategic growth plan outlined in April last year or in our capital expenditure outlook for 2012 announced in January. 
The other impairments of $105 million were primarily related to a  third quarter charge for Paladin and Pilot Gold marketable securities acquired as part of the Fronteer acquisition, favorable tax planning opportunities, which, by definition, are hard to predict, added $65 million to the bottom-line, plus some discontinued operations arose during the fourth quarter on the royalty dispute relating to St. Andrew Goldfields. Taking above into account, we reported adjusted net income for 2011 of roughly $4.40 a share. 
Turning briefly to our 2012 outlook for CAS, which we announced in January, Slide 8 breaks down the 10% increase year-over-year by region and cost driver. In addition to industrywide inflation process, I will just note the following. The increase in Asia-Pacific costs reflect the higher allocation of cost of gold through byproduct accounting, higher wage rates in Aussie dollar terms, the recently approved carbon tax that goes into effect on July 1, 2012, and a higher Australian dollar assumption. 
Looking at cost drivers, labor cost increases and consumable cost increases for fuels and balls drove most of that increase. Moving to Slide 9, as we announced on Wednesday, the board approved the declaration of a  first quarter dividend of $0.35 a share March 29 to shareholders of record on March 15. This dividend represents an increase of 133% from a year ago and is in line with our gold price link dividend policy, reflecting a fourth quarter average realized gold price of $1,670 an ounce. Based on a $64 share price, this represents an industry-leading annualized yield of 2.2%, higher than the current year with the S&P 500 yield on the 10-year Treasury and almost 260 basis points higher than the gold ETF. 
And finally, we continue to believe that at the end of the day, per-share metrics matter in this business, and in particular, we think that the full metrics depicted on Slide 10 are key determinants of long-term value creation for shareholders in the gold business. As we look at opportunities to put our shareholders' capital to work, either in our own portfolio or externally, these metrics remain front and center in our minds. I will now turn the call over to Gary for his perspective on our regional operating results."

I've been following Richard and the team and the direction that Newmont's been taking, and I was attracted by Newmont's good reputation, focus on sustainable development and value creation. It's been a very busy last 3 months. I visited most of the operations and most of the major projects across the globe and we've got fantastic assets, great people and some good opportunity across the group. I bring a passion for safety which is shared across the business. 
Despite this good focus, we did, unfortunately, have 5 people from our workforce and contractors lose their license in 2011, and clearly this is not acceptable. I'll be working with the team to accelerate our safety improvement efforts going forward in 2012. 
On Slide 11, comparing Newmont's production and cost profile from 2010 to 2011, the power of the portfolio is evident. As Russell mentioned earlier, while year-over-year production was down about 4%, results were in line with our outlook as production from North America and Africa offset anticipated declines in South America and Asia-Pacific. From a cost standpoint, the largest impacts are also felt in our South America and Asia-Pacific regions. Again, this performance was anticipated and included in our outlook as we expected lower production in both of these regions, and in particular, we expected Asia-Pacific's cost to reflect the processing of stockpile ore at Batu Hijau as we transition from mining and processing Phase 5 ore in 2010 to stripping face 6 and processing lower grade stockpiles in 2012 and 2013. For a detailed discussion of mine-by-mine performance, please see yesterday's release and 10-K. 
For this morning's call, I'd like to focus my regional remarks on key drivers of production and cost in 2011. Turning to Slide 12, our North American 2011 production was up slightly from a year ago due to the new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo, as well as the completion of silver mediation work at Gold Quarry which is partially offset by lower production from our undergrad mine, Chukar. Gold CAS was higher due to higher surface mining and milling costs, partially offset by higher silver byproduct credits. 
In 2012, priorities in Nevada include the Leeville ventilation shaft repair work which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. I'd also like to point out that our outlook for the year at Nevada of 1.7 million to 1.8 million ounces of production includes the expectation of seasonal downtime in the second quarter as a result of planned maintenance on our roster as was the case in 2011. 
Moving to Slide 13, our South American region successfully met outlook despite roadblock activity that temporarily affected access to our Yanacocha mine during the fourth quarter. Gold's production for the year was lower at Yanacocha relative to 2010 due to the lower leach pad or placement and partially offset by higher grades and recoveries. Gold CAS was higher due to lower production, higher mining costs and lower silver byproduct credits. 
Turning now to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 14, the year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the stripping campaign at Batu Hijau which is expected to continue through the end of 2013. As a result, both gold and copper production were lower than a year ago for the region, partially offset by higher mill throughput and higher copper grade at Boddington. Both gold and copper CAS were higher due to the lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor and commodity costs. 
Turning to Slide 15, to shed a little additional light on Batu Hijau, the Phase 6 stripping campaign is expected to conclude in late 2013 and we expect to be back in the higher grade orders ore in 2014. In the picture you can see on the left, which was taken last week, we're looking towards the South, and you can see the wider areas in both the south and back towards you in the north that's the stripping that's going on and its relative position to the rest of the pit. We're up to the top and we'll be working our way done over the next couple of years to cover the higher grade ore in the bottom of the pit. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 16 with Africa. Ahafo's contribution to the portfolio is greater than the prior year due to the addition of material from the Amoma pit. Fourth quarter 2011 gold production was lower than a year ago due to lower mill grade and increased inventory. Gold CAS in 2011 was higher due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs and was partially offset by higher production. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Guy to discuss our exploration results."

We're on Slide 17 will summarize our 2011 gold exploration results.

We're on Slide 17 will summarize our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have had about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces, a net increase of about 6% over last year. In addition, we grew our gold NRM by about 12% in 2011 while increasing gold in our earlier-stage resource categories. To deliver these results, we employed 125 drill rigs and drilled approximately 1.3 million meters to deliver our fourth consecutive year of reserve increases for gold and copper. 2012 exploration priorities include Long Canyon, Leeville, Carlin, Mike, Phoenix and Fiberline in Nevada, supporting the development of a new district in the Guiana Shield in South America. We are conducting extensive development into our drilling of that Merian project in Suriname with the aim of adding reserves in 2012 -- of adding NRM in 2012. Follow-up drill programs at the nearby project are coming up with promising results. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, we plan to build on our 2011 success at the Kelly underground mine in the and our KCGM operations, while Jundee and Waihi drill program should continue to add new underground mine from surface and underground drill programs. Each of these signs have great explanation terms we plan to continue aggressively testing in 2012. Meanwhile, in Africa, drill program successfully expanded the wingspan of early-stage Subika underground mineralization and we began drilling expansions of the Apensu open pits. Early-stage activity around half north demonstrated potential for additional open pit and underground mineralization near the existing reserve. Drill programs that had achieved suggest potential for underground mineralization. We will continue with this programs in 2012 as we expand our per expiration efforts in Ghana. Over the last 10 years, we have been a leader among our peers by delivering 85 million ounces of reserves through organic growth alone at a very competitive total unit reserves cost, including oil exploration costs of approximately $25 per ounce, which more than offset 75 million ounces of depletion. 
On Slide 18, we had similar success with our copper exploration efforts, boosting total reserves by 600 million pounds before depletion to a record of nearly 10 billion pounds, an increase of about 3% over last year. In addition, we grew our copper NRM by about 11% in 2011. 2012 exploration efforts will focus on proper targets in the earlier stages of our pipeline at Elang and Copper Basin in Nevada. 
Turning to Slide 19, we have only had our Long Canyon project for about a year and we are very encouraged of the progress that we have made today. In 2011, our aggressive 59-kilometer drilling program resulted in an extension of the non-mineralization by about 25%. As you can see from the section on the lower half of this slide, we have encouraging growth and thicker mineralization that supports our original thesis at the time of acquisition. For 2012, we plan to conduct over 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling that should form the basis to declare our first NRM at Long Canyon in 2012. 
From a development standpoint, we are on track to submit our plan of operations in the first quarter of 2012. Slide 20 summarizes our 3 major projects which are currently in execution and were approved by of our Board of Directors last year. Our Akyem team is making great progress. The engineering is essentially complete and overall progress is on track at about 30%, with several concrete works well underway and structural steel work commencing in January. Construction activities remain suspended at Conga while we await the completion of the EIA  review. Engineering continues and is approximately 85% complete. All major copper has been ordered in the team is currently developing plans for restarting construction activities. At Tanami, engineering is progressing and main construction contracts are about to be awarded while the sharp pilot hole drilling is in progress. 
Now I'll turn it over to Richard for his concluding remarks."

So the programs remain on track. We are spending money on both and we are dealing them both and they look actually quite good. As far as Gold Quarry is concerned, Gold Quarry is going to deliver ounces for years to come. Just to give you an example, in the reserves program this year, Gold Quarry had the significant contribution again. It's almost 800,000 ounces just from pit expansions. If you look into the NRM, again, Gold Quarry came with significant ounces as part of the Phase 8. We expect to bring more reserves next year.

In both countries, we have, in the 1, Ghana, we have a parliamentary approved, if that's such a word, stabilization agreement. And in the other Indonesia, we have a contract to work. And we have indicated to both governments that, of course, we will be flexible within reason. And that while renegotiation from their standpoint might look like higher royalties or higher taxes, that there are other components of the renegotiation which our things on our side that allow us to do things that we need to do as well. So what I would say is the impact on Newmont at the present time, we could expect that a higher royalty might take place in both of those countries are taxes, but I would expect on balance, it will not be material to the company. And then as we find anything out in those, which have both been on the table for some time and we have not seen any conclusions on either 1, so I can't really give you a precise number because we don't have 1. But what I can tell you is when we do, we'll let you know. We just want to make sure that people know that in this environment and you see it across the world, it's not just Newmont, it's not just Ghana, I think that governments and communities are demanding their fair share of mining projects in Ghana particularly in this bull market environment that we've seen over the last couple of years. I think that we have to be responsive, we have to be responsible. But what that means is that we have to be responsible to all stakeholders. It's not just about what communities want or the government wants or what our shareholders need. It's a combination to make sure we can continue to sustain the business and that's the way we address these negotiations. We have certain rights, but we also have certain obligations in every 1 of these countries."

How to get the most out of that I think is still to come. And while that certainly is a law that the Indonesians have proposed, I think they're still working through and we're trying to help them work through what the exact impact to that is. And I would tell you this, that if we go forward with Elang, we're going to have to do so along with Indonesian government because we need to get permits and we will work with them closely to ensure that what we want to do putting money on the ground for Elang, putting money on top of the ground for processing and equipment, combining that with our Batu Hijau operations, before we invest significant capital in that kind of project, we are going to ensure that we have the right arrangement that will allow us, the government and the communities to all benefit from our activities going forward. And we don't have all of that in place today, nor would I suggest to you that does the government. So what I would say is why they want to continue to have foreign direct investment in Indonesia. They have to have that to support their growth. I don't think they have the exact formula. They have pieces of what they want, but they're going to have to work with us to make sure that those pieces comport with what we need. So at this point, what I'd tell you is, we have good exploration potential in front of us. We have some negotiations in front of us and we'll see how things come out."

We are conti",1067,"Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and define the next phase of our evolution. We are continuing to make progress on the strategy we discussed with you at April Investor Day last year. We discussed delivering competitive growth and returns, unlocking our exploration upside, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders through a gold link dividend. 
And while strategies set the future, execution sets the base. So as we've been saying since 2007, everything at Newmont begins with execution. Good performance in our operations allows us to do many things. And in 2011, we delivered again on our original expectation and outlook for the year. Gary Goldberg will talk more about that in a moment. 
Also, in 2011, we took tangible steps to move our project pipeline forward. In particular, we announced initiation of construction at Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami shaft in Australia, which Guy Lansdown will speak to later in the presentation. And as we have said, competitive returns do require capital discipline. And from time to time, this means that not every project makes it to the next stage of development, and Hope Bay is such a project. And Russell will speak about the financial statement impacts of removing Hope Bay from our development pipeline later in the presentation. 
With respect to the exploration upside, we had a successful year and delivered on our exploration program. As you saw yesterday, we announced year-end reserves of 99 million ounces of gold and nearly 10 billion pounds of copper. To put this in perspective, by year-end 2011, with 5.3 million ounces of net additions, that net additions exceeded the sum of the net reserve additions published by the other 4 North American senior gold companies combined. So for the near term, our exploration team is focusing on numerous opportunities, one of which is Long Canyon, Nevada, and Guy will provide you more information on that momentarily. 
I'd just like to mention another exploration opportunity because Gary Goldberg and I just recently returned from Indonesia, where we were briefed on progress at the Elang exploration project, where we have 2 drill sites working already and we're adding a third. This is a longer-term prospective opportunity for Newmont, which is the large copper gold porphyry with similarities to our Batu Hijau project. And it's projects like Long Canyon and like Elang that underpin our belief that we can continue to deliver reserve additions through the drill bit that will, over time, allow us to discover the Newmont behind Newmont. 
We will pursue our new projects and continue to explore and fund our exploration and development program and return capital to shareholders. We can do all of that because we have a strong base of operating cash flows and a very strong balance sheet. 
In 2011, to our gold link dividend, we paid out nearly $0.5 billion in dividends or $1 per share, equating to only 23% of our adjusted net income. And as you know, we designed our gold link dividend to enhance investors' leverage to gold price, and it delivers. Since we announced the enhanced gold link dividend, Newmont's share performance has more closely correlated to the gold price than any of our peers. 
By delivering on our strong strategy and maintaining our track record of operational execution, all of that underpins the success of this company and we can only accomplish that through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, contractors and business partners across Newmont. And I want to thank all of those people for their efforts throughout 2011. But I also know that human capital strategy is important for the future and continuing to be able to retain our existing employees and attract some of the best expertise in the industry is important to our future as well. 
And I would just like to acknowledge one example of that in Gary Goldberg who recently joined us. Gary joined us in December as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will speak in a little bit. He was most recently President and CEO of Rio Tinto Minerals and is a past Chairman of the National Mining Association. Gary brings to us 30 years of experience in the mining business and is responsible now for Newmont's worldwide mining operations, health and safety, business excellence and security. Looking forward to having Gary's contributions at Newmont for some time to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. You'll see an update of the growth project pipeline that we originally communicated to you last April at Investor Day. As you can see, our North America and Africa regions each have the potential to contribute approximately 800,000 ounces of annual production growth, while our South America projects, both in Peru and Suriname, collectively have the potential to contribute 1.25 million ounces of annual production growth. 
You'll also see in the yellow box around South America that we have updated our forecast here to allow the indication that we've seen recent activities in Peru. So on November 30, we indicated that we had suspended operations at the Conga project in agreement with the government of Peru. On December 27, the government announced its intention to have a third party re-review Conga's Environmental Impact Assessment, a process that they indicated would take about 40 days. On February 17, the government announced the panel of experts that had been retained to conduct this review. At this time, it's still our intention to develop the 3 projects denoted in yellow on this slide, which include Conga, Cerro Quilish and the Yanacocha expansions. We're encouraged that the EIA review of Conga is underway, and we look forward to hearing the results in the near future. 
However, as we stated back in November, should we be able to continue with our current development plans at Conga, the scale and diversity of Newmont's global portfolio provides us with flexibility to re-prioritize and reallocate capital to maintain our focus on delivering our strategic objectives through potential development alternatives, with alternatives in Nevada, Ghana, Australia and Indonesia. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, and to discuss our full year financial and operating results."
291795,138590281,264032,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2012",2012-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term na",1535,"Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nature of our business. 
For 2011, we generated record revenue of $10.4 billion, adjusted net income of $2.2 billion or about approximately $4.39 a share and record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, clearly benefiting from continued delivery and execution of the business plan and a strong gold price environment. Gold operating margins increased 32% to $971 an ounce despite a 22% increase in operating costs. 
As outlined at our Investor Day last April, the operating cash flow has been and continues to be redeployed back in the core gold business through aggressive development of our project pipeline and through the cash acquisition of Fronteer Gold last April, an acquisition that I believe will add significant long-term value for our shareholders, to fund increased near mine and greenfield exploration. And as Richard mentioned, in line with our gold price link dividend, we returned $1 a share or approximately $500 million to our shareholders last year. 
In addition, we have significantly deleveraged the balance sheet over the past 26 months, with debt repayments of $430 million in 2010, $265 million in 2011, and as described in the subsequent event note in our recently filed Form 10-K, almost $800 million in the first 2 months of this year. We continue to evaluate our capital structure. And with net debt at year end of only $2.5 billion and a liquid marketable securities portfolio, with approximately $1.5 billion at year end, we have significant flexibility to add long-term debt without impacting our current investment grade ratings, especially in light of the current favorable interest rate environment. 
Turning briefly to the fourth quarter, production and costs were largely in line with our expectations. Although as you will no doubt have seen, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax impairment in regard to the Hope Bay project, which I will cover in more detail shortly. Adjusted net income of $1.17 a share was roughly $0.10 short of consensus, of which $0.07 can be explained by an increase in concentrate inventory on hand at Boddington in Australia due to some shipping constraints in late December. This increase was simply a timing difference, and that inventory was sold early in the first quarter. This is a long-term business, and quarterly inventory fluctuations of up to 50,000 ounces aren't uncommon for us, especially at operations where we are shipping concentrate as opposed to doré. 
In addition, the spending on exploration and advanced projects was back-end weighted, and we played a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our earnings per share. We also realized $1,670 an ounce versus, I think, the LME average for the quarter of $1,683. Almost all of this is attributable to the pricing of our concentrate sales shipments, which effectively priced over a rolling 3-month period from shipment as opposed to doré, which essentially prices overnight. 
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that our operating performance for 2011 was in line with our original outlook from last February. Attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces was right in the middle of our range, although down by 4% from a year ago due to less Phase 5 ore mined at Batu Hijau, resulting in the treatment of lower grade stockpiles and also lower leach ore placement at Yanacocha. This was partially offset by higher production at North America and Ghana in Africa. 
Gold cost applicable to sales of $591 an ounce was $1 above the high end of our original outlook, and I will go into that in a little more detail on the following slide. Attributable copper production was on target, although down significant from last year at Batu Hijau for the reasons discussed previously. Copper production at Boddington increased 21% over 2011. Copper CAS of $1.26 a pound was at the low end of our original outlook, resulting largely from the relative outperformance of gold versus copper and the corresponding lower allocation of operating costs to copper revenue. Copper CAS was up substantially from 2010 in light of the phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which will continue until the end of 2013. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on cost applicable to sales on a per-ounce basis for 2011 through a waterfall from the original budget of $572 an ounce to the reported $591 an ounce. As reflected on the chart, the stronger Australian dollar added $18 an ounce, although this was offset by $9 an ounce in Aussie dollar currency hedge gains. The relative outperformance of gold over copper added $11 an ounce to our gold CAS due to coproduct accounting for costs at Boddington and Batu Hijau. 
The higher-than-budgeted realized gold price added $7 an ounce in higher royalties and workers participation. As I've commented on previous calls, we're more than happy to pay these incremental costs, given the significant related margin expansion. On the positive side of the equation, higher by-product credits, primarily  silver for us, reduced CAS by $8 an ounce, and a reallocation of certain mining-related taxes from CAS to the income tax expense line reduced CAS by a further $7 an ounce. 
Adjusting our reported CAS solely for the impact of the stronger relative performance of gold over copper and higher-than-budgeted gold price resulted in adjusted cost applicable to sales of $573 an ounce, just below the midpoint of our original outlook from a year ago. It should also be borne in mind that our costs are reported under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar costs calculated under IFRS due to the different accounting treatment for deferred stripping and stockpiles in particular. 
Looking at the table on the right on Slide 7, net income for the year of $366 million was impacted by the following: a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $2.1 billion on a pretax basis; a $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis related to our Hope Bay project in Canada. We made a decision in January to place Hope Bay on care and maintenance after evaluating numerous development options against other opportunities in our portfolio. 
At the end of the day, our desire to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost to capital versus simply producing ounces for ounces' sake drove us to put the project in care and maintenance and reallocate capital to higher-returning projects in the portfolio. The write-down had no effect on cash flow or reserves, and Hope Bay was not included in the company's 2017 strategic growth plan outlined in April last year or in our capital expenditure outlook for 2012 announced in January. 
The other impairments of $105 million were primarily related to a  third quarter charge for Paladin and Pilot Gold marketable securities acquired as part of the Fronteer acquisition; favorable tax planning opportunities, which, by definition, are hard to predict; added $65 million to the bottom line; and the loss from discontinued operations that rose during the fourth quarter on a royalty dispute relating to St. Andrew Goldfields. Taking above into account, we reported adjusted net income for 2011 of roughly $4.40 a share. 
Turning briefly to our 2012 outlook for CAS, which we announced in January. Slide 8 breaks down the 10% increase year-over-year by region and cost driver. In addition to industry-wide inflation pressures, I would just note the following: the increase in Asia Pacific costs reflects the higher allocation of cost to gold through by-product accounting; higher wage rates in Aussie dollar terms; the recently approved carbon tax that goes into effect on July 1, 2012; and a higher Australian dollar assumption. Looking at cost drivers, labor cost increases and consumable cost increases for fuels and bulks drove most of that increase. 
Moving to Slide 9. As we announced on Wednesday, the board approved the declaration of a first quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on March 29 to shareholders of record on March 15. This dividend represents an increase of 133% from a year ago, is in line with our gold price link dividend policy, reflecting a fourth quarter average realized gold price of $1,670 an ounce. Based on a $64 share price, this represents an industry-leading annualized yield of 2.2%, higher than the current year on the S&P 500 yield, the yield on the 10-year Treasury and almost 260 basis points higher than the gold ETF. 
And finally, we continue to believe that at the end of the day, per-share metrics matter in this business, and in particular, we think that the full metrics depicted on Slide 10 are key determinants of long-term value creation for shareholders in the gold business. As we look at opportunities to put our shareholders' capital to work either in our own portfolio or externally, these metrics remain front and center in our minds. 
I will now call -- turn the call over to Gary for his perspective on our regional operating results."

I've been following Richard and the team and the direction that Newmont's been taking, and I was attracted by Newmont's good reputation, focus on sustainable development and value creation. It's been a very busy last 3 months. I visited most of the operations and most of the major projects across the globe, and we've got fantastic assets, great people and some good opportunity across the group. I bring a passion for safety, which is shared across the business. 
Despite this good focus, we did, unfortunately, have 5 people from our workforce and contractors lose their life in 2011 and clearly, this is not acceptable. I'll be working with the team to accelerate our safety improvement efforts going forward in 2012. 
On Slide 11. Comparing Newmont's production and cost profile from 2010 to 2011, the power of the portfolio is evident. As Russell mentioned earlier, while year-over-year production was down about 4%, results were in line with our outlook as production from North America and Africa offset anticipated declines in South America and Asia Pacific. 
From a cost standpoint, the largest impacts were also felt in our South America and Asia Pacific regions. Again, this performance was anticipated and included in our outlook as we expected lower production in both of these regions. And in particular, we expected Asia Pacific's cost to reflect the processing of stockpiled ore at Batu Hijau as we transition from mining and processing Phase 5 ore in 2010 to stripping Phase 6 and processing lower grade stockpiles in 2012 and 2013. 
For a detailed discussion of mine-by-mine performance, please see yesterday's release and 10-K. For this morning's call, I'd like to focus my regional remarks on key drivers of production and cost in 2011. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our North American 2011 production was up slightly from a year ago due to the new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo, as well as the completion of slope remediation work at Gold Quarry, which is partially offset by lower production from our underground mine, Chukar. Gold CAS was higher due to higher surface mining and milling costs, partially offset by higher silver by-product credits. 
In 2012, priorities in Nevada include the Leeville ventilation shaft repair work, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. I'd also like to point out that our outlook for the year at Nevada of 1.7 million to 1.8 million ounces of production includes the expectation of seasonal downtime in the second quarter as a result of planned maintenance on our roster as was the case in 2011. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our South American region successfully met outlook despite roadblock activity that temporarily affected access to our Yanacocha mine during the fourth quarter. Gold production for the year was lower at Yanacocha relative to 2010 due to lower leach pad ore placement and partially offset by higher grades and recoveries. Gold CAS was higher due to lower production, higher mining costs and lower silver by-product credits. 
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 14. The year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which is expected to continue through the end of 2013. As a result, both gold and copper production were lower than a year ago for the region, partially offset by higher mill throughput and higher copper grade at Boddington. Both gold and copper CAS were higher due to the lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor and commodity costs. 
Turning to Slide 15. To shed a little additional light on Batu Hijau, the Phase 6 stripping campaign is expected to conclude in late 2013, and we expect to be back in the higher grade ore in 2014. In the picture you can see on the left, which was taken last week, we're looking towards the south, and you can see the wider areas in both the south and back towards you in the north. That's the stripping that's going on and its relative position to the rest of the pit. We're up at the top, and we'll be working our way down over the next couple of years to uncover the higher grade ore in the bottom of the pit. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 16 with Africa. Ahafo's contribution to the portfolio was greater than the prior year due to the addition of material from the Amoma pit. Fourth quarter 2011 gold production was lower than a year ago due to lower mill grade and increased inventory. Gold CAS in 2011 was higher due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs and was partially offset by higher production. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Guy to discuss our exploration results."

Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces,",680,"Thank you, Gary, and good day. Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces, a net increase of about 6% over last year. In addition, we grew our gold NRM by about 12% in 2011 while increasing gold in our earlier-stage resource categories. To deliver these results, we employed 125 drill rigs and drilled approximately 1.3 million meters to deliver our fourth consecutive year of reserve increases for gold and copper. 
2012 exploration priorities include Long Canyon, Leeville, Carlin, Mike, Phoenix and Fiberline in Nevada. Supporting the development of a new district in the Guiana Shield in South America, we are conducting extensive development intro drilling at the Merian project in Suriname, with the aim of adding reserves in 2012 -- of adding NRM in 2012. Follow-up drill programs at the nearby Sabajo project are coming up with promising results. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we plan to build on our 2011 success at the Callie underground mine in the Tanami and at KCGM operations, while Jundee and Waihi drill program should continue to add new underground mine life from surface and underground drill programs. Each of these sites have great exploration potential, and we plan to continue aggressively testing in 2012. 
Meanwhile, in Africa, drill programs successfully expanded the wingspan of early-stage Subika underground mineralization, and we began drilling extensions of the Apensu open pits. Early-stage activity around Ahafo North demonstrated potential for additional open pit and underground mineralization near the existing reserve. Drill programs at Akyem suggest potential for underground mineralization. We will continue with these programs in 2012 as we expand our exploration efforts in Ghana. 
Over the last 10 years, we have been a leader among our peers by delivering 85 million ounces of reserves through organic growth alone at a very competitive total unit reserves cost, including ore exploration costs of approximately $25 per ounce, which more than offset 75 million ounces of depletion. 
On Slide 18, we had similar success with our copper exploration efforts, boosting total reserves by 600 million pounds before depletion to a record of nearly 10 billion pounds, an increase of about 3% over last year. In addition, we grew our copper NRM by about 11% in 2011. 2012 exploration efforts will focus on copper targets in the earlier stages of our pipeline at Elang and Copper Basin in Nevada. 
Turning to Slide 19. We have only had our Long Canyon project for about a year, and we are very encouraged of the progress that we have made to date. In 2011, our aggressive 59-kilometer drilling program resulted in an extension of the non-mineralization by about 25%. As you can see from the section on the lower half of the slide, we have encouraging grade and thicker mineralization that supports our original thesis at the time of acquisition. For 2012, we plan to conduct over 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling that should form the basis to declare our first NRM at Long Canyon in 2012. 
From a development standpoint, we are on track to submit our plan of operations in the first quarter of 2012. Slide 20 summarizes our 3 major projects, which are currently in execution and were approved by our Board of Directors last year. 
Our Akyem team is making great progress. The engineering is essentially complete and overall progress is on track at about 30%, with civil and concrete works well underway and structural steel work commencing in January. Construction activities remain suspended at Conga while we await the completion of the EIA  review. Engineering continues and is approximately 85% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and the team is currently developing plans for restarting construction activities. At Tanami, engineering is progressing and main construction contracts are about to be awarded, while the shaft pilot hole drilling is in progress. 
Now I'll turn it over to Richard for his concluding remarks."

I'll conclude by reiterating our commitment to delivering shareholder value through execution on the 5 components of our strategy. We will pursue growth but not growth at any cost, and it will be growth that delivers competitive returns. Our 2011 performance affirms that Newmont will continue to execute on its operating base, continue to realize its exploration potential and continue to build competitive projects that deliver competitive returns. 
And finally, by maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating robust operating cash flows, we will remain a unique investment platform because we can return capital to shareholders while providing competitive growth, delivering ounces which produce current cash flow and allow us to continue to drive the business forward, both for today and for the future. So combining these components provide a powerful and compelling value proposition that we believe truly differentiate this company and position us for the future. 
So with that, we'll be happy to take your questions and thanks for listening."

So to give you a sense in meters, it's about 450 meters extension to the north. And to the south, actually we are adding again about a few hundred meters. But please keep in mind that we are still early stage here. We have been there for almost a year now, and we really try to confirm the resource first before we were actually able to do any expansion drilling. At the same time, as you are probably aware, we had some permit limitations there in terms of the amount of exploration that we can do in the district pending the extensions. Now we have secured these permits last year, and we expect this year to show much more district exploration."

And we balance that investment with our expectations around gold price and the balance sheet strength. I'll say that if a project is delivering strong economic returns, we will find a way to fund it. Probably more of an issue for us, quite frankly, in this environment is finding the human capital to build it. So the balance sheet is obviously something we do spend a lot of time looking at.

And we have indicated to both governments that, of course, we'll be flexible within reason. And that while renegotiation from their standpoint might look like higher royalties or higher taxes, that there are other components of a renegotiation, which are things on our side that allow us to do things that we need to do as well. So what I would say is the impact on Newmont at the present time, we could expect that a higher royalty might take place, in both of those countries, or taxes. But I would expect that on balance, it will not be material to the company. And that as we find anything out in those, which have both been on the table for some time and we have not seen any conclusions on either one, so I can't really give you a precise number because we don't have one. But what I can tell you is when we do, we'll let you know. We just want to make sure that people know that in this environment -- and you see it across the world, it's not just Newmont, it's not just Ghana, and I think that governments and communities are demanding their fair share of mining projects, particularly in this bull market environment that we've seen over the last couple of years. I think that we have to be responsive. We have to be responsible, but what that means is that we have to be responsible to all stakeholders. It's not just about what communities want or the government wants or what our shareholders need. It's a combination to make sure we can continue to sustain the business, and that's the way we address these negotiations.

And again, I would suggest to you that my recent discussions with the government of Indonesia, prior discussions, I think Indonesia is trying to ensure, like a lot of countries, that they get the most out of not just the mining but also the mining and beneficiation of the resources owned by the country. How to get the most out of that, I think, is still to come. And while that certainly is a law that the Indonesians have proposed, I think they are still working through, and we're trying to help them work through, what the exact impact of that is. And I would tell you this, that if we go forward with Elang, we're going to have to do so along with Indonesian government because we need to get permits. And we will work with them closely to ensure that what we want to do, putting money on the ground for Elang, putting money on top of the ground for processing and equipment, combining that with our Batu Hijau operations. Before we invest significant capital in that kind of project, we are going to ensure that we have the right arrangement that will allow us, the government and the communities to all benefit from our activities going forward. And we don't have all of that in place today, nor would I suggest to you does the government. So what I would say is, while they want to continue to have foreign direct investment in Indonesia, they have to have that to support their growth. I don't think they have the exact formula. They have pieces of what they want, but they're going to have to work with us to make sure that those pieces comport with what we need. So at this point, what I'd tell you is, we have good exploration potential in front of us. We have some negotiations in front of us, and we'll see how things come out."

And I think with respect to each of those categories, we provide what we provide, which is we provide a resource base. We can develop it. We can put people to work. We can provide taxes. And in this case, we can take water, which at the moment is not consumable, and we can turn it into something which is and which is more sustainable over time and which is more predictable, less seasonal.

For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are cont",1063,"Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are continuing to make progress on the strategy we discussed with you at April Investor Day last year. We discussed delivering competitive growth and returns, unlocking our exploration upside, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders through a gold-linked dividend. 
And while strategy sets the future, execution sets the base. So as we've been saying since 2007, everything at Newmont begins with execution. Good performance in our operations allows us to do many things. And in 2011, we delivered again on our original expectation and outlook for the year. Gary Goldberg will talk more about that in a moment. 
Also in 2011, we took tangible steps to move our project pipeline forward. In particular, we announced initiation of construction at Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami shaft in Australia, which Guy Lansdown will speak to later in the presentation. And as we have said, competitive returns do require capital discipline. And from time to time, this means that not every project makes it to the next stage of development, and Hope Bay is such a project. And Russell will speak about the financial statement impacts of removing Hope Bay from our development pipeline later in the presentation. 
With respect to the exploration upside, we had a successful year and delivered on our exploration program. As you saw yesterday, we announced year-end reserves of 99 million ounces of gold and nearly 10 billion pounds of copper. To put this in perspective, by year-end 2011, with 5.3 million ounces of net additions, that net additions exceeded the sum of the net reserve additions published by the other 4 North American senior gold companies combined. So for the near term, our exploration team is focusing on numerous opportunities, one of which is Long Canyon, Nevada, and Guy will provide you more information on that momentarily. 
I'd just like to mention another exploration opportunity because Gary Goldberg and I just recently returned from Indonesia, where we were briefed on progress at the Elang exploration project, where we have 2 drill sites working already and we're adding a third. This is a longer-term prospective opportunity for Newmont, which is a large copper gold porphyry with similarities to our Batu Hijau project. And it's projects like Long Canyon and like Elang that underpin our belief that we can continue to deliver reserve additions through the drill bit that will, over time, allow us to discover the Newmont behind Newmont. 
We will pursue our new projects and continue to explore and fund our exploration and development program and return capital to shareholders. We can do all of that because we have a strong base of operating cash flows and a very strong balance sheet. 
In 2011, through our gold-linked dividend, we paid out nearly $0.5 billion in dividends or $1 per share, equating to only 23% of our adjusted net income. And as you know, we designed our gold-linked dividend to enhance investors' leverage to gold price, and it delivers. Since we announced the enhanced gold-linked dividend, Newmont's share performance has more closely correlated to the gold price than any of our peers. 
By delivering on our strong strategy and maintaining our track record of operational execution, all of that underpins the success of this company and we can only accomplish that through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, contractors and business partners across Newmont. And I want to thank all of those people for their efforts throughout 2011. But I also know that human capital strategy is important for the future and continuing to be able to retain our existing employees and attract some of the best expertise in the industry is important to our future as well. 
And I would just like to acknowledge one example of that in Gary Goldberg, who recently joined us. Gary joined us in December as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will speak in a little bit. He was most recently President and CEO of Rio Tinto Minerals and is a past Chairman of the National Mining Association. Gary brings to us 30 years of experience in the mining business and is responsible now for Newmont's worldwide mining operations, health and safety, business excellence and security. Looking forward to having Gary's contributions at Newmont for some time to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. You'll see an update of the growth project pipeline that we originally communicated to you last April at Investor Day. As you can see, our North America and Africa regions each have the potential to contribute approximately 800,000 ounces of annual production growth, while our South America projects, both in Peru and Suriname, collectively have the potential to contribute 1.25 million ounces of annual production growth. 
You'll also see in the yellow box around South America that we have updated our forecast here to allow the indication that we've seen recent activities in Peru. So on November 30, we indicated that we had suspended operations at the Conga project in agreement with the government of Peru. On December 27, the government announced its intention to have a third party re-review Conga's Environmental Impact Assessment, a process that they indicated would take about 40 days. On February 17, the government announced the panel of experts that had been retained to conduct this review. At this time, it's still our intention to develop the 3 projects denoted in yellow on this slide, which include Conga, Cerro Quilish and the Yanacocha expansions. We're encouraged that the EIA review of Conga is underway, and we look forward to hearing the results in the near future. 
However, as we stated back in November, should we be unable to continue with our current development plans at Conga, the scale and diversity of Newmont's global portfolio provides us with flexibility to reprioritize and reallocate capital to maintain our focus on delivering our strategic objectives through potential development alternatives, with alternatives in Nevada, Ghana, Australia and Indonesia. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, and to discuss our full year financial and operating results."

As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term na",1529,"Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nature of our business. 
For 2011, we generated record revenue of $10.4 billion; adjusted net income of $2.2 billion or about approximately $4.39 a share; and record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, clearly benefiting from continued delivery and execution of the business plan and a strong gold price environment. Gold operating margins increased 32% to $971 an ounce despite a 22% increase in operating costs. 
As outlined at our Investor Day last April, the operating cash flow has been and continues to be redeployed back in the core gold business through aggressive development of our project pipeline and through the cash acquisition of Fronteer Gold last April, an acquisition that I believe will add significant long-term value for our shareholders, to fund increased near-mine and greenfield exploration. And as Richard mentioned, in line with our gold price-linked dividend, we returned $1 a share or approximately $500 million to our shareholders last year. 
In addition, we have significantly deleveraged the balance sheet over the past 26 months, with debt repayments of $430 million in 2010, $265 million in 2011, and as described in the subsequent event note in our recently filed Form 10-K, almost $800 million in the first 2 months of this year. We continue to evaluate our capital structure. And with net debt at year end of only $2.5 billion and a liquid marketable securities portfolio with approximately $1.5 billion at year end, we have significant flexibility to add long-term debt without impacting our current investment-grade ratings, especially in light of the current favorable interest rate environment. 
Turning briefly to the fourth quarter, production and costs were largely in line with our expectations although, as you will no doubt have seen, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax impairment in regard to the Hope Bay project, which I will cover in more detail shortly. Adjusted net income of $1.17 a share was roughly $0.10 short of consensus, of which $0.07 can be explained by an increase in concentrate inventory on hand at Boddington in Australia due to some shipping constraints in late December. This increase was simply a timing difference, and that inventory was sold early in the first quarter. This is a long-term business, and quarterly inventory fluctuations of up to 50,000 ounces aren't uncommon for us, especially at operations where we are shipping concentrate as opposed to doré. 
In addition, the spending on exploration and advanced projects was back-end weighted, and we played a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our earnings per share. We also realized $1,670 an ounce versus, I think, the LME average for the quarter of $1,683. Almost all of this is attributable to the pricing of our concentrate sales shipments, which effectively price over a rolling 3-month period from shipment as opposed to doré, which essentially prices overnight. 
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that our operating performance for 2011 was in line with our original outlook from last February. Attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces was right in the middle of our range, although down by 4% from a year ago due to less Phase 5 ore mined at Batu Hijau, resulting in the treatment of lower-grade stockpiles and also lower leach ore placement at Yanacocha. This was partially offset by higher production at North America and Ghana in Africa. 
Gold cost applicable to sales of $591 an ounce was $1 above the high end of our original outlook, and I will go into that in a little more detail on the following slide. Attributable copper production was on target, although down significant from last year at Batu Hijau for the reasons discussed previously. Copper production at Boddington increased 21% over 2011. Copper CAS of $1.26 a pound was at the low end of our original outlook, resulting largely from the relative outperformance of gold versus copper and the corresponding lower allocation of operating costs to copper revenue. Copper CAS was up substantially from 2010 in light of the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which will continue until the end of 2013. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on cost applicable to sales on a per-ounce basis for 2011 through a waterfall from the original budget of $572 an ounce to the reported $591 an ounce. As reflected on the chart, the stronger Australian dollar added $18 an ounce, although this was offset by $9 an ounce in Aussie dollar currency hedge gains. The relative outperformance of gold over copper added $11 an ounce to our gold CAS due to coproduct accounting for costs at Boddington and Batu Hijau. 
The higher-than-budgeted realized gold price added $7 an ounce in higher royalties and workers participation. As I've commented on previous calls, we're more than happy to pay these incremental costs, given the significant related margin expansion. On the positive side of the equation, higher by-product credits, primarily  silver for us, reduced CAS by $8 an ounce, and a reallocation of certain mining-related taxes from CAS to the income tax expense line reduced CAS by a further $7 an ounce. 
Adjusting our reported CAS solely for the impact of the stronger relative performance of gold over copper and higher-than-budgeted gold price resulted in adjusted cost applicable to sales of $573 an ounce, just below the midpoint of our original outlook from a year ago. It should also be borne in mind that our costs are reported under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar costs calculated under IFRS, due to the different accounting treatment for deferred stripping and stockpiles in particular. 
Looking at the table on the right on Slide 7, net income for the year of $366 million was impacted by the following: a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $2.1 billion on a pretax basis, or $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis, related to our Hope Bay project in Canada. We made a decision in January to place Hope Bay on care and maintenance after evaluating numerous development options against other opportunities in our portfolio. At the end of the day, our desire to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted-average cost of capital versus simply producing ounces for ounces' sake drove us to put the project in care and maintenance and reallocate capital to higher-returning projects in the portfolio. The write-down had no effect on cash flow or reserves, and Hope Bay was not included in the company's 2017 strategic growth plan outlined in April last year or in our capital expenditure outlook for 2012 announced in January. 
The other impairments of $105 million were primarily related to a  third quarter charge for Paladin and Pilot Gold marketable securities acquired as part of the Fronteer acquisition; favorable tax planning opportunities which, by definition, are hard to predict added $65 million to the bottom line; and the loss from discontinued operations that arose during the fourth quarter on a royalty dispute relating to St. Andrew Goldfields. Taking the above into account, we reported adjusted net income for 2011 of roughly $4.40 a share. 
Turning briefly to our 2012 outlook for CAS, which we announced in January. Slide 8 breaks down the 10% increase year-over-year by region and cost driver. In addition to industry-wide inflation pressures, I would just note the following: the increase in Asia Pacific costs reflects the higher allocation of cost to gold through by-product accounting; higher wage rates in Aussie dollar terms; the recently approved carbon tax that goes into effect on July 1, 2012; and a higher Australian dollar assumption. Looking at cost drivers, labor cost increases and consumable cost increases for fuels and bulks drove most of that increase. 
Moving to Slide 9. As we announced on Wednesday, the board approved the declaration of a first quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on March 29 to shareholders of record on March 15. This dividend represents an increase of 133% from a year ago, is in line with our gold price-linked dividend policy, reflecting a fourth quarter average realized gold price of $1,670 an ounce. Based on a $64 share price, this represents an industry-leading annualized yield of 2.2%, higher than the current year on the S&P 500, the yield on the 10-year Treasury and almost 260 basis points higher than the gold ETF. 
And finally, we continue to believe that at the end of the day, per-share metrics matter in this business. And in particular, we think that the full metrics depicted on Slide 10 are key determinants of long-term value creation for shareholders in the gold business. As we look at opportunities to put our shareholders' capital to work either in our own portfolio or externally, these metrics remain front and center in our minds. 
I will now call -- turn the call over to Gary for his perspective on our regional operating results."

I've been following Richard and the team and the direction that Newmont's been taking, and I was attracted by Newmont's good reputation, focus on sustainable development and value creation. It's been a very busy last 3 months. I visited most of the operations and most of the major projects across the globe, and we've got fantastic assets, great people and some good opportunity across the group. I bring a passion for safety, which is shared across the business. 
Despite this good focus, we did, unfortunately, have 5 people from our workforce and contractors lose their life in 2011 and clearly, this is not acceptable. I'll be working with the team to accelerate our safety improvement efforts going forward in 2012. 
On Slide 11. Comparing Newmont's production and cost profile from 2010 to 2011, the power of the portfolio is evident. As Russell mentioned earlier, while year-over-year production was down about 4%, results were in line with our outlook as production from North America and Africa offset anticipated declines in South America and Asia Pacific. 
From a cost standpoint, the largest impacts were also felt in our South America and Asia Pacific regions. Again, this performance was anticipated and included in our outlook as we expected lower production in both of these regions. And in particular, we expected Asia Pacific's cost to reflect the processing of stockpiled ore at Batu Hijau as we transition from mining and processing Phase 5 ore in 2010 to stripping Phase 6 and processing lower-grade stockpiles in 2012 and 2013. 
For a detailed discussion of mine-by-mine performance, please see yesterday's release and 10-K. For this morning's call, I'd like to focus my regional remarks on key drivers of production and cost in 2011. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our North American 2011 production was up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo, as well as the completion of slope remediation work at Gold Quarry, which is partially offset by lower production from our underground mine, Chukar. Gold CAS was higher due to higher surface mining and milling costs, partially offset by higher silver by-product credits. 
In 2012, priorities in Nevada include the Leeville ventilation shaft repair work, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. I'd also like to point out that our outlook for the year at Nevada of 1.7 million to 1.8 million ounces of production includes the expectation of seasonal downtime in the second quarter as a result of planned maintenance on our roaster, as was the case in 2011. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our South American region successfully met outlook despite roadblock activity that temporarily affected access to our Yanacocha mine during the fourth quarter. Gold production for the year was lower at Yanacocha relative to 2010 due to lower leach pad ore placement and partially offset by higher grades and recoveries. Gold CAS was higher due to lower production, higher mining costs and lower silver by-product credits. 
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 14. The year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which is expected to continue through the end of 2013. As a result, both gold and copper production were lower than a year ago for the region, partially offset by higher mill throughput and higher copper grade at Boddington. Both gold and copper CAS were higher due to the lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor and commodity costs. 
Turning to Slide 15. To shed a little additional light on Batu Hijau, the Phase 6 stripping campaign is expected to conclude in late 2013, and we expect to be back in the higher grade ores in 2014. In the picture you can see on the left, which was just taken last week, we're looking towards the south, and you can see the wider areas in both the south and back towards you in the north. That's the stripping that's going on and its relative position to the rest of the pit. We're up at the top, and we'll be working our way down over the next couple of years to uncover the higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 16 with Africa. Ahafo's contribution to the portfolio was greater than the prior year due to the addition of material from the Amoma pit. Fourth quarter 2011 gold production was lower than a year ago due to lower mill grade and increased inventory. Gold CAS in 2011 was higher due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, and was partially offset by higher production. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Guy to discuss our exploration results."

Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces,",680,"Thank you, Gary, and good day. Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces, a net increase of about 6% over last year. In addition, we grew our gold NRM by about 12% in 2011, while increasing gold in our earlier-stage resource categories. To deliver these results, we employed 125 drill rigs and drilled approximately 1.3 million meters to deliver our fourth consecutive year of reserve increases for gold and copper. 
2012 exploration priorities include Long Canyon, Leeville, Carlin, Mike, Phoenix and Fiberline in Nevada. Supporting the development of a new district in the Guiana Shield in South America, we are conducting extensive development infill drilling at the Merian project in Suriname, with the aim of adding reserves in 2012 -- of adding NRM in 2012. Follow-up drill programs at the nearby Sabajo project are coming up with promising results. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we plan to build on our 2011 success at the Callie underground mine in the Tanami and at KCGM operations, while Jundee and Waihi drill programs should continue to add new underground mine life from surface and underground drill programs. Each of these sites have great exploration potential that we plan to continue aggressively testing in 2012. 
Meanwhile, in Africa, drill programs successfully expanded the wingspan of early-stage Subika underground mineralization, and we began drilling extensions of the Apensu open pits. Early-stage activity around Ahafo North demonstrated potential for additional open pit and underground mineralization near the existing reserve. Drill programs at Akyem suggest potential for underground mineralization. We will continue with these programs in 2012 as we expand our exploration efforts in Ghana. 
Over the last 10 years, we have been a leader among our peers by delivering 85 million ounces of reserves through organic growth alone at a very competitive total unit reserves cost, including ore exploration costs of approximately $25 per ounce, which more than offset 75 million ounces of depletion. 
On Slide 18, we had similar success with our copper exploration efforts, boosting total reserves by 600 million pounds before depletion to a record of nearly 10 billion pounds, an increase of about 3% over last year. In addition, we grew our copper NRM by about 11% in 2011. 2012 exploration efforts will focus on copper targets in the earlier stages of our pipeline at Elang and Copper Basin in Nevada. 
Turning to Slide 19. We have only had our Long Canyon project for about a year, and we are very encouraged at the progress that we have made to-date. In 2011, our aggressive 59-kilometer drilling program resulted in an extension of the known mineralization by about 25%. As you can see from the section on the lower half of the slide, we have encouraging grade and thicker mineralization that supports our original thesis at the time of acquisition. For 2012, we plan to conduct over 70 kilometers of infill, expansion and district exploration drilling that should form the basis to declare our first NRM at Long Canyon in 2012. 
From a development standpoint, we are on track to submit our plan of operations in the first quarter of 2012. Slide 20 summarizes our 3 major projects, which are currently in execution and were approved by our Board of Directors last year. 
Our Akyem team is making great progress. The engineering is essentially complete and overall progress is on track at about 30%, with civil and concrete works well underway and structural steel work commencing in January. Construction activities remain suspended at Conga while we await the completion of the EIA  review. Engineering continues and is approximately 85% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and the team is currently developing plans for restarting construction activities. At Tanami, engineering is progressing and main construction contracts are about to be awarded, while the shaft pilot hole drilling is in progress. 
Now I'll turn it over to Richard for his concluding remarks."

So the programs remain on track. We are spending money on both, and we are dealing them both. And they look actually quite good. As far as Gold Quarry is concerned, Gold Quarry is going to deliver ounces for years to come. Just to give you an example, in the reserves program this year, Gold Quarry had the significant contribution again. It's almost 800,000 ounces just from pit expansions. If you look into the NRM, again, Gold Quarry came with significant ounces as part of the Phase 8. We expect to bring more reserves next year.

But please keep in mind that we are still early stage here. We have been there for almost a year now, and we really try to confirm the resource first before we were actually able to do any expansion drilling.

And that while renegotiation from their standpoint might look like higher royalties or higher taxes, that there are other components of a renegotiation, which are things on our side that allow us to do things that we need to do as well. So what I would say is the impact on Newmont at the present time, we could expect that a higher royalty might take place in both of those countries, or taxes. But I would expect that on balance, it will not be material to the company, and that as we find anything out in those -- which have both been on the table for some time and we have not seen any conclusions on either one, so I can't really give you a precise number because we don't have one. But what I can tell you is when we do, we'll let you know. We just want to make sure that people know that in this environment -- and you see it across the world. It's not just Newmont, it's not just Ghana. I think that governments and communities are demanding their fair share of mining projects, particularly in this bull market environment that we've seen over the last couple of years. I think that we have to be responsive. We have to be responsible, but what that means is that we have to be responsible to all stakeholders. It's not just about what communities want or the government wants or what our shareholders need.

And again, I would suggest to you that my recent discussions with the government of Indonesia, prior discussions, I think Indonesia is trying to ensure, like a lot of countries, that they get the most out of not just the mining but also the mining and beneficiation of the resources owned by the country. How to get the most out of that, I think, is still to come. And while that certainly is a law that the Indonesians have proposed, I think they are still working through, and we're trying to help them work through, what the exact impact of that is. And I would tell you this, that if we go forward with Elang, we're going to have to do so along with the Indonesian government, because we're going to need to get permits. And we will work with them closely to ensure that what we want to do, putting money in the ground for Elang, putting money on top of the ground for processing and equipment, combining that with our Batu Hijau operations -- before we invest significant capital in that kind of project, we are going to ensure that we have the right arrangement that will allow us, the government and the communities to all benefit from our activities going forward. And we don't have all of that in place today, nor would I suggest to you does the government. So what I would say is, while they want to continue to have foreign direct investment in Indonesia -- they have to have that to support their growth, I don't think they have the exact formula. They have pieces of what they want, but they're going to have to work with us to make sure that those pieces comport with what we need.

As a result of that, we do try to stay plugged into what's important to those people. It's an agrarian community. As you point out, there's a lot of history there. I think the roadblocks come from a number of different parameters. They come from politicians. They come from local citizens who are concerned about water and jobs. And I think with respect to each of those categories, we provide what we provide, which is we provide a resource base. We can develop it. We can put people to work. We can provide taxes. And in this case, we can take water, which at the moment is not consumable, and we can turn it into something which is and which is more sustainable over time and which is more predictable, less seasonal. So I think we can provide what the community needs. And how politicians and others accept that is up to them. We can only do what we can do.

For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are cont",1063,"Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are continuing to make progress on the strategy we discussed with you at April Investor Day last year. We discussed delivering competitive growth and returns, unlocking our exploration upside, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders through a gold-linked dividend. 
And while strategy sets the future, execution sets the base. So as we've been saying since 2007, everything at Newmont begins with execution. Good performance in our operations allows us to do many things. And in 2011, we delivered again on our original expectation and outlook for the year. Gary Goldberg will talk more about that in a moment. 
Also in 2011, we took tangible steps to move our project pipeline forward. In particular, we announced initiation of construction at Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami shaft in Australia, which Guy Lansdown will speak to later in the presentation. And as we have said, competitive returns do require capital discipline. And from time to time, this means that not every project makes it to the next stage of development, and Hope Bay is such a project. And Russell will speak about the financial statement impacts of removing Hope Bay from our development pipeline later in the presentation. 
With respect to the exploration upside, we had a successful year and delivered on our exploration program. As you saw yesterday, we announced year-end reserves of 99 million ounces of gold and nearly 10 billion pounds of copper. To put this in perspective, by year-end 2011, with 5.3 million ounces of net additions, that net additions exceeded the sum of the net reserve additions published by the other 4 North American senior gold companies combined. So for the near term, our exploration team is focusing on numerous opportunities, one of which is Long Canyon, Nevada, and Guy will provide you more information on that momentarily. 
I'd just like to mention another exploration opportunity because Gary Goldberg and I just recently returned from Indonesia, where we were briefed on progress at the Elang exploration project, where we have 2 drill sites working already and we're adding a third. This is a longer-term prospective opportunity for Newmont, which is a large copper gold porphyry with similarities to our Batu Hijau project. And it's projects like Long Canyon and like Elang that underpin our belief that we can continue to deliver reserve additions through the drill bit that will, over time, allow us to discover the Newmont behind Newmont. 
We will pursue our new projects and continue to explore and fund our exploration and development program and return capital to shareholders. We can do all of that because we have a strong base of operating cash flows and a very strong balance sheet. 
In 2011, through our gold-linked dividend, we paid out nearly $0.5 billion in dividends or $1 per share, equating to only 23% of our adjusted net income. And as you know, we designed our gold-linked dividend to enhance investors' leverage to gold price, and it delivers. Since we announced the enhanced gold-linked dividend, Newmont's share performance has more closely correlated to the gold price than any of our peers. 
By delivering on our strong strategy and maintaining our track record of operational execution, all of that underpins the success of this company and we can only accomplish that through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, contractors and business partners across Newmont. And I want to thank all of those people for their efforts throughout 2011. But I also know that human capital strategy is important for the future and continuing to be able to retain our existing employees and attract some of the best expertise in the industry is important to our future as well. 
And I would just like to acknowledge one example of that in Gary Goldberg, who recently joined us. Gary joined us in December as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will speak in a little bit. He was most recently President and CEO of Rio Tinto Minerals and is a past Chairman of the National Mining Association. Gary brings to us 30 years of experience in the mining business and is responsible now for Newmont's worldwide mining operations, health and safety, business excellence and security. Looking forward to having Gary's contributions at Newmont for some time to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. You'll see an update of the growth project pipeline that we originally communicated to you last April at Investor Day. As you can see, our North America and Africa regions each have the potential to contribute approximately 800,000 ounces of annual production growth, while our South America projects, both in Peru and Suriname, collectively have the potential to contribute 1.25 million ounces of annual production growth. 
You'll also see in the yellow box around South America that we have updated our forecast here to allow the indication that we've seen recent activities in Peru. So on November 30, we indicated that we had suspended operations at the Conga project in agreement with the government of Peru. On December 27, the government announced its intention to have a third party re-review Conga's Environmental Impact Assessment, a process that they indicated would take about 40 days. On February 17, the government announced the panel of experts that had been retained to conduct this review. At this time, it's still our intention to develop the 3 projects denoted in yellow on this slide, which include Conga, Cerro Quilish and the Yanacocha expansions. We're encouraged that the EIA review of Conga is underway, and we look forward to hearing the results in the near future. 
However, as we stated back in November, should we be unable to continue with our current development plans at Conga, the scale and diversity of Newmont's global portfolio provides us with flexibility to reprioritize and reallocate capital to maintain our focus on delivering our strategic objectives through potential development alternatives, with alternatives in Nevada, Ghana, Australia and Indonesia. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, and to discuss our full year financial and operating results."

As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term na",1529,"Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nature of our business. 
For 2011, we generated record revenue of $10.4 billion; adjusted net income of $2.2 billion or about approximately $4.39 a share; and record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, clearly benefiting from continued delivery and execution of the business plan and a strong gold price environment. Gold operating margins increased 32% to $971 an ounce despite a 22% increase in operating costs. 
As outlined at our Investor Day last April, the operating cash flow has been and continues to be redeployed back in the core gold business through aggressive development of our project pipeline and through the cash acquisition of Fronteer Gold last April, an acquisition that I believe will add significant long-term value for our shareholders, to fund increased near-mine and greenfield exploration. And as Richard mentioned, in line with our gold price-linked dividend, we returned $1 a share or approximately $500 million to our shareholders last year. 
In addition, we have significantly deleveraged the balance sheet over the past 26 months, with debt repayments of $430 million in 2010, $265 million in 2011, and as described in the subsequent event note in our recently filed Form 10-K, almost $800 million in the first 2 months of this year. We continue to evaluate our capital structure. And with net debt at year end of only $2.5 billion and a liquid marketable securities portfolio with approximately $1.5 billion at year end, we have significant flexibility to add long-term debt without impacting our current investment-grade ratings, especially in light of the current favorable interest rate environment. 
Turning briefly to the fourth quarter, production and costs were largely in line with our expectations although, as you will no doubt have seen, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax impairment in regard to the Hope Bay project, which I will cover in more detail shortly. Adjusted net income of $1.17 a share was roughly $0.10 short of consensus, of which $0.07 can be explained by an increase in concentrate inventory on hand at Boddington in Australia due to some shipping constraints in late December. This increase was simply a timing difference, and that inventory was sold early in the first quarter. This is a long-term business, and quarterly inventory fluctuations of up to 50,000 ounces aren't uncommon for us, especially at operations where we are shipping concentrate as opposed to doré. 
In addition, the spending on exploration and advanced projects was back-end weighted, and we played a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our earnings per share. We also realized $1,670 an ounce versus, I think, the LME average for the quarter of $1,683. Almost all of this is attributable to the pricing of our concentrate sales shipments, which effectively price over a rolling 3-month period from shipment as opposed to doré, which essentially prices overnight. 
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that our operating performance for 2011 was in line with our original outlook from last February. Attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces was right in the middle of our range, although down by 4% from a year ago due to less Phase 5 ore mined at Batu Hijau, resulting in the treatment of lower-grade stockpiles and also lower leach ore placement at Yanacocha. This was partially offset by higher production at North America and Ghana in Africa. 
Gold cost applicable to sales of $591 an ounce was $1 above the high end of our original outlook, and I will go into that in a little more detail on the following slide. Attributable copper production was on target, although down significant from last year at Batu Hijau for the reasons discussed previously. Copper production at Boddington increased 21% over 2011. Copper CAS of $1.26 a pound was at the low end of our original outlook, resulting largely from the relative outperformance of gold versus copper and the corresponding lower allocation of operating costs to copper revenue. Copper CAS was up substantially from 2010 in light of the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which will continue until the end of 2013. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on cost applicable to sales on a per-ounce basis for 2011 through a waterfall from the original budget of $572 an ounce to the reported $591 an ounce. As reflected on the chart, the stronger Australian dollar added $18 an ounce, although this was offset by $9 an ounce in Aussie dollar currency hedge gains. The relative outperformance of gold over copper added $11 an ounce to our gold CAS due to coproduct accounting for costs at Boddington and Batu Hijau. 
The higher-than-budgeted realized gold price added $7 an ounce in higher royalties and workers participation. As I've commented on previous calls, we're more than happy to pay these incremental costs, given the significant related margin expansion. On the positive side of the equation, higher by-product credits, primarily  silver for us, reduced CAS by $8 an ounce, and a reallocation of certain mining-related taxes from CAS to the income tax expense line reduced CAS by a further $7 an ounce. 
Adjusting our reported CAS solely for the impact of the stronger relative performance of gold over copper and higher-than-budgeted gold price resulted in adjusted cost applicable to sales of $573 an ounce, just below the midpoint of our original outlook from a year ago. It should also be borne in mind that our costs are reported under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar costs calculated under IFRS, due to the different accounting treatment for deferred stripping and stockpiles in particular. 
Looking at the table on the right on Slide 7, net income for the year of $366 million was impacted by the following: a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $2.1 billion on a pretax basis, or $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis, related to our Hope Bay project in Canada. We made a decision in January to place Hope Bay on care and maintenance after evaluating numerous development options against other opportunities in our portfolio. At the end of the day, our desire to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted-average cost of capital versus simply producing ounces for ounces' sake drove us to put the project in care and maintenance and reallocate capital to higher-returning projects in the portfolio. The write-down had no effect on cash flow or reserves, and Hope Bay was not included in the company's 2017 strategic growth plan outlined in April last year or in our capital expenditure outlook for 2012 announced in January. 
The other impairments of $105 million were primarily related to a  third quarter charge for Paladin and Pilot Gold marketable securities acquired as part of the Fronteer acquisition; favorable tax planning opportunities which, by definition, are hard to predict added $65 million to the bottom line; and the loss from discontinued operations that arose during the fourth quarter on a royalty dispute relating to St. Andrew Goldfields. Taking the above into account, we reported adjusted net income for 2011 of roughly $4.40 a share. 
Turning briefly to our 2012 outlook for CAS, which we announced in January. Slide 8 breaks down the 10% increase year-over-year by region and cost driver. In addition to industry-wide inflation pressures, I would just note the following: the increase in Asia Pacific costs reflects the higher allocation of cost to gold through by-product accounting; higher wage rates in Aussie dollar terms; the recently approved carbon tax that goes into effect on July 1, 2012; and a higher Australian dollar assumption. Looking at cost drivers, labor cost increases and consumable cost increases for fuels and bulks drove most of that increase. 
Moving to Slide 9. As we announced on Wednesday, the board approved the declaration of a first quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on March 29 to shareholders of record on March 15. This dividend represents an increase of 133% from a year ago, is in line with our gold price-linked dividend policy, reflecting a fourth quarter average realized gold price of $1,670 an ounce. Based on a $64 share price, this represents an industry-leading annualized yield of 2.2%, higher than the current year on the S&P 500, the yield on the 10-year Treasury and almost 260 basis points higher than the gold ETF. 
And finally, we continue to believe that at the end of the day, per-share metrics matter in this business. And in particular, we think that the full metrics depicted on Slide 10 are key determinants of long-term value creation for shareholders in the gold business. As we look at opportunities to put our shareholders' capital to work either in our own portfolio or externally, these metrics remain front and center in our minds. 
I will now call -- turn the call over to Gary for his perspective on our regional operating results."

I've been following Richard and the team and the direction that Newmont's been taking, and I was attracted by Newmont's good reputation, focus on sustainable development and value creation. It's been a very busy last 3 months. I visited most of the operations and most of the major projects across the globe, and we've got fantastic assets, great people and some good opportunity across the group. I bring a passion for safety, which is shared across the business. 
Despite this good focus, we did, unfortunately, have 5 people from our workforce and contractors lose their life in 2011 and clearly, this is not acceptable. I'll be working with the team to accelerate our safety improvement efforts going forward in 2012. 
On Slide 11. Comparing Newmont's production and cost profile from 2010 to 2011, the power of the portfolio is evident. As Russell mentioned earlier, while year-over-year production was down about 4%, results were in line with our outlook as production from North America and Africa offset anticipated declines in South America and Asia Pacific. 
From a cost standpoint, the largest impacts were also felt in our South America and Asia Pacific regions. Again, this performance was anticipated and included in our outlook as we expected lower production in both of these regions. And in particular, we expected Asia Pacific's cost to reflect the processing of stockpiled ore at Batu Hijau as we transition from mining and processing Phase 5 ore in 2010 to stripping Phase 6 and processing lower-grade stockpiles in 2012 and 2013. 
For a detailed discussion of mine-by-mine performance, please see yesterday's release and 10-K. For this morning's call, I'd like to focus my regional remarks on key drivers of production and cost in 2011. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our North American 2011 production was up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo, as well as the completion of slope remediation work at Gold Quarry, which is partially offset by lower production from our underground mine, Chukar. Gold CAS was higher due to higher surface mining and milling costs, partially offset by higher silver by-product credits. 
In 2012, priorities in Nevada include the Leeville ventilation shaft repair work, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. I'd also like to point out that our outlook for the year at Nevada of 1.7 million to 1.8 million ounces of production includes the expectation of seasonal downtime in the second quarter as a result of planned maintenance on our roster, as was the case in 2011. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our South American region successfully met outlook despite roadblock activity that temporarily affected access to our Yanacocha mine during the fourth quarter. Gold production for the year was lower at Yanacocha relative to 2010 due to lower leach pad ore placement and partially offset by higher grades and recoveries. Gold CAS was higher due to lower production, higher mining costs and lower silver by-product credits. 
Turning now to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 14. The year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which is expected to continue through the end of 2013. As a result, both gold and copper production were lower than a year ago for the region, partially offset by higher mill throughput and higher copper grade at Boddington. Both gold and copper CAS were higher due to the lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor and commodity costs. 
Turning to Slide 15. To shed a little additional light on Batu Hijau, the Phase 6 stripping campaign is expected to conclude in late 2013, and we expect to be back in the higher grade ores in 2014. In the picture you can see on the left, which was just taken last week, we're looking towards the south, and you can see the wider areas in both the south and back towards you in the north. That's the stripping that's going on and its relative position to the rest of the pit. We're up at the top, and we'll be working our way down over the next couple of years to uncover the higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit. 
I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 16 with Africa. Ahafo's contribution to the portfolio was greater than the prior year due to the addition of material from the Amoma pit. Fourth quarter 2011 gold production was lower than a year ago due to lower mill grade and increased inventory. Gold CAS in 2011 was higher due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, and was partially offset by higher production. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Guy to discuss our exploration results."

Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces,",680,"Thank you, Gary, and good day. Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces, a net increase of about 6% over last year. In addition, we grew our gold NRM by about 12% in 2011, while increasing gold in our earlier-stage resource categories. To deliver these results, we employed 125 drill rigs and drilled approximately 1.3 million meters to deliver our fourth consecutive year of reserve increases for gold and copper. 
2012 exploration priorities include Long Canyon, Leeville, Carlin, Mike, Phoenix and Fiberline in Nevada. Supporting the development of a new district in the Guiana Shield in South America, we are conducting extensive development infill drilling at the Merian project in Suriname, with the aim of adding reserves in 2012 -- of adding NRM in 2012. Follow-up drill programs at the nearby Sabajo project are coming up with promising results. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we plan to build on our 2011 success at the Callie underground mine in the Tanami and at KCGM operations, while Jundee and Waihi drill programs should continue to add new underground mine life from surface and underground drill programs. Each of these sites have great exploration potential that we plan to continue aggressively testing in 2012. 
Meanwhile, in Africa, drill programs successfully expanded the wingspan of early-stage Subika underground mineralization, and we began drilling extensions of the Apensu open pits. Early-stage activity around Ahafo North demonstrated potential for additional open pit and underground mineralization near the existing reserve. Drill programs at Akyem suggest potential for underground mineralization. We will continue with these programs in 2012 as we expand our exploration efforts in Ghana. 
Over the last 10 years, we have been a leader among our peers by delivering 85 million ounces of reserves through organic growth alone at a very competitive total unit reserves cost, including ore exploration costs of approximately $25 per ounce, which more than offset 75 million ounces of depletion. 
On Slide 18, we had similar success with our copper exploration efforts, boosting total reserves by 600 million pounds before depletion to a record of nearly 10 billion pounds, an increase of about 3% over last year. In addition, we grew our copper NRM by about 11% in 2011. 2012 exploration efforts will focus on copper targets in the earlier stages of our pipeline at Elang and Copper Basin in Nevada. 
Turning to Slide 19. We have only had our Long Canyon project for about a year, and we are very encouraged at the progress that we have made to-date. In 2011, our aggressive 59-kilometer drilling program resulted in an extension of the known mineralization by about 25%. As you can see from the section on the lower half of the slide, we have encouraging grade and thicker mineralization that supports our original thesis at the time of acquisition. For 2012, we plan to conduct over 70 kilometers of infill, expansion and district exploration drilling that should form the basis to declare our first NRM at Long Canyon in 2012. 
From a development standpoint, we are on track to submit our plan of operations in the first quarter of 2012. Slide 20 summarizes our 3 major projects, which are currently in execution and were approved by our Board of Directors last year. 
Our Akyem team is making great progress. The engineering is essentially complete and overall progress is on track at about 30%, with civil and concrete works well underway and structural steel work commencing in January. Construction activities remain suspended at Conga while we await the completion of the EIA  review. Engineering continues and is approximately 85% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and the team is currently developing plans for restarting construction activities. At Tanami, engineering is progressing and main construction contracts are about to be awarded, while the shaft pilot hole drilling is in progress. 
Now I'll turn it over to Richard for his concluding remarks."

So the programs remain on track. We are spending money on both, and we are dealing them both. And they look actually quite good. As far as Gold Quarry is concerned, Gold Quarry is going to deliver ounces for years to come. Just to give you an example, in the reserves program this year, Gold Quarry had the significant contribution again. It's almost 800,000 ounces just from pit expansions.

And we consider, obviously, our ability to fund ongoing exploration. And capital does come in 2 forms in the sense of new projects, expansion capital and also sustaining capital. And we balance that investment with our expectations around gold price and the balance sheet strength. I'll say that if a project is delivering strong economic returns, we will find a way to fund it. Probably more of an issue for us, quite frankly, in this environment is finding the human capital to build it. So the balance sheet is obviously something we do spend a lot of time looking at. But in this positive environment, we can fund a number of projects. Getting the people and keeping the people to fund and to build those projects is probably the biggest challenge right now."

And we have indicated to both governments that, of course, we'll be flexible within reason. And that while renegotiation from their standpoint might look like higher royalties or higher taxes, that there are other components of a renegotiation, which are things on our side that allow us to do things that we need to do as well. So what I would say is the impact on Newmont at the present time, we could expect that a higher royalty might take place in both of those countries, or taxes. But I would expect that on balance, it will not be material to the company, and that as we find anything out in those -- which have both been on the table for some time and we have not seen any conclusions on either one, so I can't really give you a precise number because we don't have one. But what I can tell you is when we do, we'll let you know. We just want to make sure that people know that in this environment -- and you see it across the world. It's not just Newmont, it's not just Ghana. I think that governments and communities are demanding their fair share of mining projects, particularly in this bull market environment that we've seen over the last couple of years. I think that we have to be responsive. We have to be responsible, but what that means is that we have to be responsible to all stakeholders. It's not just about what communities want or the government wants or what our shareholders need. It's a combination to make sure that we can continue to sustain the business, and that's the way we address these negotiations.

And again, I would suggest to you that my recent discussions with the government of Indonesia, prior discussions, I think Indonesia is trying to ensure, like a lot of countries, that they get the most out of not just the mining but also the mining and beneficiation of the resources owned by the country. How to get the most out of that, I think, is still to come. And while that certainly is a law that the Indonesians have proposed, I think they are still working through, and we're trying to help them work through, what the exact impact of that is. And I would tell you this, that if we go forward with Elang, we're going to have to do so along with the Indonesian government, because we're going to need to get permits. And we will work with them closely to ensure that what we want to do, putting money in the ground for Elang, putting money on top of the ground for processing and equipment, combining that with our Batu Hijau operations -- before we invest significant capital in that kind of project, we are going to ensure that we have the right arrangement that will allow us, the government and the communities to all benefit from our activities going forward. And we don't have all of that in place today, nor would I suggest to you does the government. So what I would say is, while they want to continue to have foreign direct investment in Indonesia -- they have to have that to support their growth, I don't think they have the exact formula. They have pieces of what they want, but they're going to have to work with us to make sure that those pieces comport with what we need. So at this point, what I'd tell you is, we have good exploration potential in front of us. We have some negotiations in front of us, and we'll see how things come out."

For those of you the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. As we announced last year, during our Investor Day New York, we continue to focus our efforts on offering shareholders a combination of competitive production growth and returns, exploration upside, balance sheet strength and a commitment to return capital back to shareholders. Our first quarter financial and operating results supported our efforts in each of these areas, with consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year quarter; operating margins, up 29% and a 22% increase in the average realized gold price of $1,684 per ounce; stable gold production of 1.3 million ounces; operating costs well within our guidance; and a 75% increase in our dividend over the prior year's quarter to $0.35 per share. 
We are maintaining our 2012 outlook for production as applicable to sales and capital spending. Regarding our exploration upside, we continue to see the potential to add the equivalent of 90 million ounces of gold to reserves between 2011 and 2020. And in 2011, as disclosed previously, we made significant progress by adding 11.6 million ounces of gold to reserves or approximately 10% of that target. 
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and to provide additional financial flexibility. We recently took advantage of favorable debt markets to raise $2.5 billion of senior notes, to repay borrowings and replenish the balance sheet. Russell will speak to this in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 4, as many of you know, our growth potential includes a number of new projects, including the Akyem project in Ghana, were construction is now 40% complete and going very well. Our growth potential also includes our Conga Project and other projects in Peru. As most of you have heard, the Conga Project's environmental impact assessment, which was previously approved by the central government of Peru in October 2010, after an extensive public engagement process, was subject to a review by independent experts during the first quarter of 2012 at the request of the central government. The results of the independent review were released last week and confirmed that the EIA met Peruvian and international standards. The report also goes on to recommend, among other considerations, that we assess the technical and economic feasibility of relocating the way stone in order to reserve thus will in and Chico Lakes. We are currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations contained in the independent report and additional recommendations from the government to assess the future impacts on the project's economics. 
Conga is a significant investment in Peru and would be, we believe, a catalyst for economic and social development in the Cajamarca region, while also protecting water quality and providing year-round water availability for downstream users. Conga's development will be a significant source of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant employment. We've been privileged to work in Peru for more than 20 years and we want to continue to be part of the government's social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through responsible mining. 
Conga cannot be developed, though, in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner while also earning our shareholders an acceptable return, and we will reallocate that capital to other development projects in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, and we can combine that with a possible return of additional capital to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our first quarter financial and operating results."

Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs. Adjusted net income of $578 million or $1.17 a share was slightly ahead of expectations,",907,"Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs. Adjusted net income of $578 million or $1.17 a share was slightly ahead of expectations, driven largely by those lower operating costs. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income reported under U.S. GAAP is included as an appendix on Slide 22 and reflects a $71 million charge, net of tax benefits of $4 million for discontinued operations from an increased accrual related to the property realty. More detail on this can be found in note 10 on Page 11 of the 10-Q. And in addition, a write-down of $24 million in marketable securities acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, net of the miscellaneous asset sales. Cash from continuing operations of $613 million for the quarter was off 38% from the year-ago quarter, largely due to working capital changes. I'll provide some color on this shortly. 
Moving to Slide 6, attributable gold production of 1.3 million ounces is essentially in line with a year ago despite a much lower contribution from Batu Hijau. Gold costs applicable to sales of $6.20 an ounce while up 11% from the year-ago quarter or approximately $20 an ounce below budget for the quarter. More on that in a moment. 
Our gold operating margin continues to expand with a 29% increase to $1,064 an ounce and a 22% increase in the realized gold price to $16.84  an ounce. Slide 7 provides more detail on the decrease in operating cash flow from the year-ago quarter. As you can see, the benefit of volume was $400 million from a higher realized gold price. However, this was offset by lower copper revenues due to lower production at Batu Hijau, with the realized copper price essentially flat. We had a net increase in working capital of $377 million due to $100 million increase in stock pile and Leach inventory on hand and a similar increase in doré and concentrated receivables on hand at quarter end. 
And finally, the balance of the working capital change was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of almost $200 million, nearly 2011 related to the collection of late fourth quarter 2010 concentrate sales from Batu Hijau. More detail on working capital changes can be found in note 22 on Page 24 of the 10-Q. 
Slide 8 outlines the drivers of the 11% increase in CAS from the year-ago quarter. The higher realized gold price added $16 an ounce as workers' participation in Peru, an increase in royalties tied to the gold price and higher allocation of cost to gold from copper at Batu Hijau and Boddington where we reallocate our operating cost of the coproduct basis. Our spending at a $12 an ounce largely in the form of higher labor and contracted services. Byproduct credits were $10 an ounce, largely partly due to lower silver price and also lower silver volumes for the quarter. Assumed diesel cost at a $9 an ounce, stronger than assumed Australian dollar adding $70 an ounce net of hedge credits; and finally, lower sales volumes due to lower production in Batu Hijau and an increase in inventory on hand added about $9 an ounce. 
You should expect a renewed focus on cost reduction going forward. When we think about costs, we think about them cost across the entire product lifecycle from exploration to advance projects, operating costs and G&A. Look for more details our efforts in this regard at our Analyst Day to be held in New York on May 23. 
Turning to Slide 9, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our gold price linked dividend policy. Based on our realized gold price of $16.84 for the quarter, the board approved a  second quarter dividend of $0.35 a share over June 28th to holders of record at the close on June 12. The dividend represents an increase of 75% from the year-ago quarter, resulting in a yield of approximately 3% based on today's share price. 
Finally, I would like to take a minute to comment on our capital structure in light of our very successful debt capital market transaction in March. First, a quick bit of history. In 2011, we repaid $217 million of our 18 5-ASA debentures and completed a Fronteer acquisition for cash out to have approximately $2.1 billion. The first quarter of this year, we repaid $517 million in convertible senior notes and $105 million in debt related to the refractory treatment plant in Nevada. With interest rates at near record lows, we decided to access the big capital markets, refinance some of that debt we had retired over the last 2 years and at the same time, to turn out our debt profile. We raised net proceeds of just under $1.5 billion due in 2022 at a pretax cost of 3.5% and just under $1 billion due in 2042 to pretax cost of 4 7/8. The dead raising provides a significant financial strength and flexibility to deliver out of growth profile through a combination of strong cash flows in the current gold price environment, cash on hand at the quarter end of approximately $2.6 billion and a solid investment grade credit rating. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the regional performance in more detail and to provide a project update."

From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce. On Slide 10, you see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North a",1103,"Thanks, Russell. From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce. 
On Slide 10, you see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North and South America or Africa's production was down slightly due to production of slightly lower grade material in line with the mine plan. Those production impacts reflected in our CAS with A-Pac incurring the largest increase in CAS as we spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau across a lower production base. 
Turning to Slide 11, our North American production was 489,000 ounces in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in Nevada, along with higher leach placement at La Herradura and the start of production at Noche Buena in Mexico. CAS was $613 per ounce, down just slightly from a year ago due to lower inventory drawdown costs. 
Recall that a year ago, Newmont was in the final stages of remediation at Gold Quarry, so in the first quarter of 2011, we mine less material than in 2012. Looking to Q2, we expect to complete repairs at the Leeville vent shaft by June. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the second quarter production is historically Nevada's lowest quarter and it will be again this year due primarily to annual scheduled maintenance at the Mill 6 roster in Nevada which usually lasts about 30 days. Over the last couple of years, it has been roughly 10% to 20% lower production than the other 3 quarters of the year. The impact of this downtime has been incorporated in the full year gold production outlook for Nevada of 1.725 million to 1.8 million ounces. 
Turning to Slide 12, you'll see an update on North American projects. At Emigrant, which is part of our Nevada expansions, we currently expect commissioning in July. Development of the Vista 7 vein at Twin Creeks is also on track and we expect it to make a small contribution beginning in the second quarter. The Phoenix copper leach pad construction is nearly complete and ore placement has begun. Construction of the solvent extraction electro winning plants is scheduled to begin in late 2012. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll round out my discussion of Nevada growth projects with Long Canyon. Based on the work conducted by Fronteer, as well as our work since the acquisition, we continue to believe in our original investment thesis that Long Canyon holds the potential to grow beyond 3x to 4x Fronteer's estimates. We are confident because our drilling results, and you can see a planned view on Slide 13, has doubled the extent of the known mineralization from 1 kilometer to 2 kilometers along straight, which when you look on the slide, is in the Northeast, Southwest, upper right, lower left direction, along the length of the ore body, with mineralization remaining open along strike. 
In addition, a number of new targets which are outlined on here, dotted and dashed in red, have been generated that will be drilled in 2012. For 2012, we're planning to complete approximately 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling, with the objective of completing an associated prefeasibility study to declare first NRM in conjunction with our 2012 year-end reporting. 
Finally, and importantly, we submitted our plan of operations during the first quarter to maintain our aggressive push-forward on the project representing a major step in securing the necessary permits. The scope for this submission calls for both leach and mill operations. 
Turning to our South American region on Slide 14, Q1 attributable production of 201,000 ounces was 26% higher than a year ago as we process some higher grade material from the El Tapado pit and it's also an alignment with our mine plan which more than offset some lower leach pad production during the quarter. CAS decreased with higher production, partially offset by higher labor, diesel and workers' participation costs and lower silver byproduct credits. 
Moving to Slide 15, our Asia-Pacific region delivered 442,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter. This was down 15% from a year ago due to lower production at Batu Hijau, which I've already discussed since combined with no maintenance at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. We also need to mention that Boddington in the first quarter production was lower than planned due to an extended mill maintenance shut and a subsequent conveyor drive motor failure for a day that decreased our production for the quarter. This is not anticipated in the further quarters. Both the higher gold and copper CAS of $774 per ounce and $1.98 per pound, respectively, were a function of lower production and higher mill maintenance costs that I just mentioned. 
At Batu Hijau, we recently experienced the pit wall failure that limits access to the bottom of the mine. However, Batu is currently in a stripping phase and we are processing stockpiled material so this does not cause any immediate production impact. As a reminder, since Batu is currently in the stripping phase, it is a very small contributor at less than 1% of our overall gold production outlook for the year. 
At the Tanami Shaft in Australia, construction of the camp is complete and we're in the process of finalizing vendor selection for the new crusher and we've awarded the underground mine development contract. 
Turning to Slide 16, we've summarized first quarter performance at Ahafo in Africa, where production of 175,000 ounces was down about 6% from Q1 2011 due to mine sequencing that I mentioned earlier. CAS was $568, from a year ago due to lower production and higher direct mining costs, along with an increase in royalties and taxes related to higher gold prices. 
Turning to Slide 17, you'll see an image of construction on the Ball Mill and SAG Mill foundations at the Akyem project in Ghana. Construction is progressing very well. We recently poured first concrete at the primary pressure, started work on the conveyor quarter, poured to the final floor section of the mining services area workshop and completed the reclaimed tunnels lab ore. We received approval to start pit clearing and work on the pit area and pit access roads which began in February. Meanwhile, we're currently investing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo growth area. 
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

As you know, we've been going through a divestiture process over the last several years. And as a result of that, we have almost continuous interaction with both the local community, who have an interest in the current shares that have been divested as well as an interest in the potential shares. The central government, who is the buyer, at least at the moment, for the 7%, and we hope that, that will close sometime in the next few months. I think as we see that 7% close, I think we will then be through the divestiture issues. And then solidly, into what does the rest of Indonesia look like. We think Indonesia continues to be prospective within our contracted work. We are continuing to explore it around which we think has potential to be similar to Batu Hijau in terms of its output, but probably, price is big and half the grade, so obviously dependent on economics. But we continue to look at that. Why? Because we believe the clinical situation in Indonesia continues to support mining. We do have a contract to work and the government has indicated that they would like to see certain forms or provisions of that change, including the potential for refining more copper product in Indonesia. And what I can tell you is, that the one refinery that is available in Indonesia to process this fall. So we continue to work with the government on what we're going to do next that's really what's going to happen, somebody's going to have to construct a refinery. So what I'd say is the dialogue with Indonesia continues to be a dialogue, but I'd say generally, it's been constructive. We have worked through the issues, we've been there quite some time. I think on the ground, we provide meaningful jobs and meaningful revenue to the government and we continue to be cited as one of the most environmentally and, I think, financially, in terms of filing our tax returns and paying on time of any mining company in Peru, I meant in Indonesia. But you could also say that in Peru. So we continue to be positive, I think, about Indonesia.

For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. As we announced last year during our Investor Day in New York, we continue to focus our efforts on offering shareholders a combination of competitive production growth and returns, exploration upside, balance sheet strength and a commitment to return capital back to shareholders. 
Our first quarter financial and operating results supported our efforts in each of these areas, with consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter; operating margins, up 29% on a 22% increase in the average realized gold price of $1,684 per ounce; stable gold production of 1.3 million ounces; operating costs well within our guidance; and a 75% increase in our dividend over the prior year's quarter to $0.35 per share. We are maintaining our 2012 outlook for production, costs applicable to sales and capital spending. 
Regarding our exploration upside, we continue to see the potential to add the equivalent of 90 million ounces of gold to reserves between 2011 and 2020. And in 2011, as disclosed previously, we made significant progress by adding 11.6 million ounces of gold to reserves or approximately 10% of that target.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. And to provide additional financial flexibility, we recently took advantage of favorable debt markets to raise $2.5 billion of senior notes, to repay borrowings and replenish the balance sheet. Russell will speak to this in a few moments.
Turning to Slide 4, as many of you know, our growth potential includes a number of new projects, including the Akyem project in Ghana where construction is now 40% complete and going very well. Our growth potential also includes our Conga project and other projects in Peru. 
As most of you have heard, the Conga project's environmental impact assessment, which was previously approved by the central government of Peru in October 2010 after an extensive public engagement process, was subject to a review by independent experts during the first quarter of 2012 at the request of the central government. The results of the independent review were released last week and confirmed that the EIA met Peruvian and international standards. The report also goes on to recommend, among other considerations, that we assess the technical and economic feasibility of relocating the Perol waste dump in order to try to preserve the Azul and Chica lakes. We are currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations contained in the independent report and additional recommendations from the government to assess the future impacts on the project's economics.
Conga is a significant investment in Peru and would be, we believe, a catalyst for economic and social development in the Cajamarca region, while also protecting water quality and providing year-round water availability for downstream users. 
Conga's development would be a significant source of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant employment. We've been privileged to work in Peru for more than 20 years, and we want to continue to be part of the government's social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through responsible mining.
If conga cannot be developed, though, in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner while also earning our shareholders an acceptable return, then we will reallocate that capital to other development projects in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, and we can combine that with a possible return of additional capital to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our first quarter financial and operating results."

Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs. 
Adjusted net income of $578 million, or $1.17 a share, was slightly ahead of expectations, driven largely by those lower operating costs. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income reported under U.S. GAAP is included as an appendix on Slide 22 and reflects a $71 million charge, net of tax benefits of $4 million, for discontinued operations from an increased accrual related to the Holt property royalty. More detail on this can be found in Note 10 on Page 11 of the 10-Q. And in addition, a write-down of $24 million in marketable securities acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, net of the miscellaneous asset sales. 
Cash from continuing operations of $613 million for the quarter was off 38% from the year-ago quarter, largely due to working capital changes. I'll provide some color on this shortly.
Moving to Slide 6, attributable gold production of 1.3 million ounces is essentially in line with the year ago despite a much lower contribution from Batu Hijau. Gold costs applicable to sales of $620 an ounce, while up 11% from the year-ago quarter, were approximately $20 an ounce below budget for the quarter. More on that in a moment. Our gold operating margin continues to expand with a 29% increase to $1,064 an ounce on a 22% increase in the realized gold price to $1,684 an ounce. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on the decrease in operating cash flow from the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we benefited by almost $400 million from a higher realized gold price. However, this was offset by lower copper revenues due to lower production at Batu Hijau, with the realized copper price essentially flat. We had a net increase in working capital of $377 million due to $100 million increase in stockpile and leach pad inventory on hand and a similar increase in doré and concentrate receivables on hand at quarter end.
And finally, the balance of the working capital change was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of almost $200 million in early 2011 related to the collection of late fourth quarter 2010 concentrate sales from Batu Hijau. More detail on working capital changes can be found in Note 22 on Page 24 of the 10-Q.
Slide 8 outlines the drivers of the 11% increase in CAS from the year-ago quarter. The higher realized gold price added $16 an ounce due to highest workers' participation in Peru, an increase in royalties tied to the gold price and the higher allocation of cost to gold from copper at Batu Hijau and Boddington where we allocate our operating costs on a coproduct basis. Higher spending added $12 an ounce largely in the form of higher labor and contracted services. Byproduct credits were $10 an ounce lower, largely due to lower silver price and also lower silver volumes for the quarter. Higher-than-assumed diesel costs added $9 an ounce, with a stronger-than-assumed Australian dollar adding $7 an ounce net of hedge credits. And finally, lower sales volumes due to the lower production at Batu Hijau and an increase in inventory on hand added about $9 an ounce.
You should expect a renewed focus on cost reduction going forward. When we think about costs, we think about them across the entire product life cycle, from exploration to advance projects, operating costs and G&A. Look for more details on our efforts in this regard at our Analyst Day to be held in New York on May 23.
Turning to Slide 9, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our gold price-linked dividend policy. Based on a realized gold price of $1,684 for the quarter, the board approved the second quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on June 28 to holders of record at the close of business on June 12. The dividend represents an increase of 75% from the year-ago quarter and a resulting yield of approximately 3% based on today's share price.
Finally, I would like to take a minute to comment on our capital structure in light of our very successful debt capital market transaction in March. First, a quick bit of history. In 2011, we repaid $217 million of our 8 5/8% debentures and completed the Fronteer acquisition for cash out to have approximately $2.1 billion. In the first quarter of this year, we repaid $517 million in convertible senior notes and $105 million in debt related to the refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada. 
With interest rates at near record-lows, we decided to access the debt capital markets to refinance some of that debt we had retired over the last 2 years, and at the same time, to term out our debt profile. We raised net proceeds of just under $1.5 billion due in 2022 at a pretax cost of 3.5% and just under $1 billion due in 2042 to pretax cost of 4 7/8%. The debt raising provides significant financial strength and flexibility to deliver on our growth profile through a combination of strong operating cash flows in the current gold price environment, cash on hand at the quarter end of approximately $2.6 billion and a solid investment grade credit rating.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the regional performance in more detail and to provide a project update."

From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North",1102,"Thanks, Russell. From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.
On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North and South America, while Africa's production was down slightly due to production of slightly lower-grade material in line with the mine plan. Those production impacts were reflected in our CAS, with APAC incurring the largest increase in CAS as we spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau across a lower production base.
Turning to Slide 11, our North American production was 489,000 ounces in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in Nevada, along with higher leach placement at La Herradura and the start of production at Noche Buena in Mexico. CAS was $613 per ounce, down just slightly from a year ago due to lower inventory drawdown costs. Recall that a year ago, Newmont was in the final stages of remediation at Gold Quarry, so in the first quarter of 2011, we mine less material than in 2012. 
Looking to Q2, we expect to complete repairs at the Leeville vent shaft by June. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the second quarter production is historically Nevada's lowest quarter, and it will be again this year, due primarily to annual scheduled maintenance at the Mill 6 roster in Nevada, which usually lasts about 30 days. Over the last couple of years, it has been roughly 10% to 20% lower production than the other 3 quarters of the year. The impact of this downtime has been incorporated in the full year gold production outlook for Nevada of 1.725 million to 1.8 million ounces.
Turning to Slide 12, you'll see an update on North American projects. At Emigrant, which is part of our Nevada expansions, we currently expect commissioning in July. Development of the Vista 7 vein at Twin Creeks is also on track, and we expect it to make a small contribution beginning in the second quarter. The Phoenix Copper Leach pad construction is nearly complete and ore placement has begun. Construction of the solvent extraction electro-winning plants is scheduled to begin in late 2012.
Turning to Slide 13, I'll round out my discussion of Nevada growth projects with Long Canyon. Based on the work conducted by Fronteer, as well as our work since the acquisition, we continue to believe in our original investment thesis that Long Canyon holds the potential to grow beyond 3 to 4x Fronteer's estimates. We are confident because our drilling results, and you can see a plan view on Slide 13, has doubled the extent of the known mineralization from 1 kilometer to 2 kilometers along strike which, when you look on the slide, is in the northeast, southwest, upper-right, lower-left direction, along the length of the ore body, with mineralization remaining open along strike. In addition, a number of new targets which are outlined on here, dotted and dashed in red, have been generated that will be drilled in 2012. 
For 2012, we're planning to complete approximately 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling, with the objective of completing an associated pre-feasibility study to declare first NRM in conjunction with our 2012 year-end reporting.
Finally, and importantly, we submitted our plan of operations during the first quarter to maintain our aggressive push-forward on the project, representing a major step in securing the necessary permits. The scope for this submission calls for both leach and mill operations.
Turning to our South American region on Slide 14, Q1 attributable production of 201,000 ounces was 26% higher than a year ago as we process some higher-grade material from the El Tapado pit and it's also in alignment with our mine plan, which more than offset some lower leach pad production during the quarter. CAS decreased with higher production, partially offset by higher labor, diesel and workers' participation costs and lower silver byproduct credits.
Moving to Slide 15, our Asia-Pacific region delivered 442,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter. This was down 15% from a year ago due to lower production at Batu Hijau, which I've already discussed, and combined with no maintenance at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. We also need to mention that Boddington in the first quarter production was lower than planned due to an extended mill maintenance shut and a subsequent conveyor drive motor failure for a day that decreased our production for the quarter. This is not anticipated in the further quarters. Both the higher gold and copper CAS of $774 per ounce and $1.98 per pound, respectively, were a function of lower production and higher mill maintenance costs that I just mentioned.
At Batu Hijau, we recently experienced the pit wall failure that limits access to the bottom of the mine. However, Batu is currently in a stripping phase and we are processing stockpiled material, so this does not cause any immediate production impact. As a reminder, since Batu is currently in the stripping phase, it is a very small contributor at less than 1% of our overall gold production outlook for the year.
At the Tanami shaft project in Australia, construction of the camp is complete and we're in the process of finalizing vendor selection for the new crusher and we've awarded the underground mine development contract.
Turning to Slide 16, we've summarized first quarter performance at Ahafo in Africa, where production of 175,000 ounces was down about 6% from Q1 2011 due to mine sequencing that I mentioned earlier. CAS was $568, up from a year ago due to lower production and higher direct mining costs, along with an increase in royalties and taxes related to higher gold prices.
Turning to Slide 17, you'll see an image of construction on the ball mill and SAG Mill foundations at the Akyem project in Ghana. Construction is progressing very well. We've recently poured first concrete at the primary crusher, started work on the conveyor quarter, poured to the final floor sections of the mine services area workshop and completed the reclaimed tunnel slab core. We received approval to start pit clearing and work on the pit area and pit access roads which began in February. Meanwhile, we are currently advancing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo north area.
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

And then right on through in the G&A, and when I say G&A, I mean the corporate-wide structure both in Denver and around the world to see where we have duplication.

And when we're talking about the deposits below Yanacocha, it's significantly different in that it is a deposit which is going to require more technical work for us to assess the commercial practicability of actually producing that.

As you know, we've been going through a divestiture process over the last several years.

The central government, who is the buyer at least at the moment for the 7%, and we hope that, that will close sometime in the next few months. I think as we see that 7% close, I think we will then be through the divestiture issues and then solidly into what does the rest of Indonesia look like. We think Indonesia continues to be prospective within our contracted work. We are continuing to explore it along, which we think has potential to be similar to Batu Hijau in terms of its output, but probably, twice as big and half the grade, so obviously dependent on economics. But we continue to look at that. Why? Because we believe that the political situation in Indonesia continues to support mining. We do have a contract to work, and the government has indicated that they would like to see certain forms or provisions to that change, including the potential for refining more copper product in Indonesia. And what I can tell you is that the one refinery that is available in Indonesia to process is full. So we continue to work with the government on what we're going to do next. If that's really what's going to happen, somebody's going to have to construct the refinery. So what I'd say is the dialogue with Indonesia continues to be a dialogue. But I'd say generally, it's been constructive. We have worked through the issues. We've been there quite some time. I think on the ground, we provide meaningful jobs and meaningful revenue to the government, and we continue to be cited as one of the most environmentally and, I think, financially, in terms of filing our tax returns and paying on time of any mining company in Peru -- so I think -- or sorry, I meant in Indonesia. But you could also say that in Peru. So we continue to be positive, I think, about Indonesia. No question, we've got to keep an eye on what's happening there, and elections are going to be coming up there in the next couple of years as well."

For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. As we announced last year during our Investor Day in New York, we continue to focus our efforts on offering shareholders a combination of competitive production growth and returns, exploration upside, balance sheet strength and a commitment to return capital back to shareholders. 
Our first quarter financial and operating results supported our efforts in each of these areas, with consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter; operating margins, up 29% on a 22% increase in the average realized gold price of $1,684 per ounce; stable gold production of 1.3 million ounces; operating costs well within our guidance; and a 75% increase in our dividend over the prior year's quarter to $0.35 per share. We are maintaining our 2012 outlook for production, costs applicable to sales and capital spending. 
Regarding our exploration upside, we continue to see the potential to add the equivalent of 90 million ounces of gold to reserves between 2011 and 2020. And in 2011, as disclosed previously, we made significant progress by adding 11.6 million ounces of gold to reserves or approximately 10% of that target.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and to provide additional financial flexibility. We recently took advantage of favorable debt markets to raise $2.5 billion of senior notes, to repay borrowings and replenish the balance sheet. Russell will speak to this in a few moments.
Turning to Slide 4, as many of you know, our growth potential includes a number of new projects, including the Akyem project in Ghana where construction is now 40% complete and going very well. Our growth potential also includes our Conga project and other projects in Peru. 
As most of you have heard, the Conga project's environmental impact assessment, which was previously approved by the central government of Peru in October 2010 after an extensive public engagement process, was subject to a review by independent experts during the first quarter of 2012 at the request of the central government. The results of the independent review were released last week and confirmed that the EIA met Peruvian and international standards. The report also goes on to recommend, among other considerations, that we assess the technical and economic feasibility of relocating the Perol waste dump in order to try to preserve the Azul and Chica lakes. We are currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations contained in the independent report and additional recommendations from the government to assess the future impacts on the project's economics.
Conga is a significant investment in Peru and would be, we believe, a catalyst for economic and social development in the Cajamarca region, while also protecting water quality and providing year-round water availability for downstream users. 
Conga's development would be a significant source of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant employment. We've been privileged to work in Peru for more than 20 years, and we want to continue to be part of the government's social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through responsible mining.
If Conga cannot be developed, though, in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner while also earning our shareholders an acceptable return, then we will reallocate that capital to other development projects in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, and we can combine that with a possible return of additional capital to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our first quarter financial and operating results."

Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs. 
Adjusted net income of $578 million, or $1.17 a share, was slightly ahead of expectations, driven largely by those lower operating costs. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income reported under U.S. GAAP is included as an appendix on Slide 22 and reflects a $71 million charge, net of tax benefits of $4 million, for discontinued operations from an increased accrual related to the Holt property royalty. More detail on this can be found in Note 10 on Page 11 of the 10-Q. And in addition, a write-down of $24 million in marketable securities acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, net of the miscellaneous asset sales.  Cash from continuing operations of $613 million for the quarter was off 38% from the year-ago quarter, largely due to working capital changes. I'll provide some color on this shortly.
Moving to Slide 6, attributable gold production of 1.3 million ounces is essentially in line with a year ago despite a much lower contribution from Batu Hijau. Gold costs applicable to sales of $620 an ounce, while up 11% from the year-ago quarter, were approximately $20 an ounce below budget for the quarter. More on that in a moment. Our gold operating margin continues to expand with a 29% increase to $1,064 an ounce on a 22% increase in the realized gold price to $1,684 an ounce. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on the decrease in operating cash flow from the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we benefited by almost $400 million from a higher realized gold price. However, this was offset by lower copper revenues due to lower production at Batu Hijau, with the realized copper price essentially flat. We had a net increase in working capital of $377 million due to $100 million increase in stockpile and leach pad inventory on hand and a similar increase in doré and concentrate receivables on hand at quarter end.
And finally, the balance of the working capital change was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of almost $200 million in early 2011 related to the collection of late fourth quarter 2010 concentrate sales from Batu Hijau. More detail on working capital changes can be found in Note 22 on Page 24 of the 10-Q.
Slide 8 outlines the drivers of the 11% increase in CAS from the year-ago quarter. The higher realized gold price added $16 an ounce due to highest [ph] workers' participation in Peru, an increase in royalties tied to the gold price and the higher allocation of cost to gold from copper at Batu Hijau and Boddington where we allocate operating costs on a coproduct basis. Higher spending added $12 an ounce largely in the form of higher labor and contracted services. Byproduct credits were $10 an ounce lower, largely due to lower silver price and also lower silver volumes for the quarter. Higher-than-assumed diesel costs added $9 an ounce, with a stronger-than-assumed Australian dollar adding $7 an ounce net of hedge credits. And finally, lower sales volumes due to the lower production at Batu Hijau and an increase in inventory on hand added about $9 an ounce.
You should expect a renewed focus on cost reduction going forward. When we think about costs, we think about them across the entire product life cycle, from exploration to advance projects, operating costs and G&A. Look for more details on our efforts in this regard at our Analyst Day to be held in New York on May 23.
Turning to Slide 9, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our gold price-linked dividend policy. Based on a realized gold price of $1,684 for the quarter, the board approved a second quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on June 28 to holders of record at the close of business on June 12. The dividend represents an increase of 75% from the year-ago quarter and a resulting yield of approximately 3% based on today's share price.
Finally, I would like to take a minute to comment on our capital structure in light of our very successful debt capital market transaction in March. First, a quick bit of history. In 2011, we repaid $217 million of our 8 5/8% debentures and completed the Fronteer acquisition for cash outlay of approximately $2.1 billion. The first quarter of this year, we repaid $517 million in convertible senior notes and $105 million in debt related to the refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada. 
With interest rates at near record lows, we decided to access the debt capital markets to refinance some of that debt we had retired over the last 2 years, and at the same time, to term out our debt profile. We raised net proceeds of just under $1.5 billion due in 2022 at a pretax cost of 3.5% and just under $1 billion due in 2042 at a pretax cost of 4 7/8%. The debt raising provides significant financial strength and flexibility to deliver on our growth profile through a combination of strong operating cash flows in the current gold price environment, cash on hand at the quarter end of approximately $2.6 billion and a solid investment grade credit rating.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the regional performance in more detail and to provide a project update."

From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North",1101,"Thanks, Russell. From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.
On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North and South America, while Africa's production was down slightly due to production of slightly lower-grade material in line with the mine plan. Those production impacts were reflected in our CAS, with APAC incurring the largest increase in CAS as we spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau across a lower production base.
Turning to Slide 11, our North American production was 489,000 ounces in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in Nevada, along with higher leach placement at La Herradura and the start of production at Noche Buena in Mexico. CAS was $613 per ounce, down just slightly from a year ago due to lower inventory drawdown costs. Recall that a year ago, Newmont was in the final stages of remediation at Gold Quarry, so in the first quarter of 2011, we mined less material than in 2012. 
Looking to Q2, we expect to complete repairs at the Leeville vent shaft by June. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the second quarter production is historically Nevada's lowest quarter, and it will be again this year, due primarily to annual scheduled maintenance at the Mill 6 roaster in Nevada, which usually lasts about 30 days. Over the last couple of years, it has been roughly 10% to 20% lower production than the other 3 quarters of the year. The impact of this downtime has been incorporated in the full year gold production outlook for Nevada of 1.725 million to 1.8 million ounces.
Turning to Slide 12, you'll see an update on North American projects. At Emigrant, which is part of our Nevada expansions, we currently expect commissioning in July. Development of the Vista 7 vein at Twin Creeks is also on track, and we expect it to make a small contribution beginning in the second quarter. The Phoenix Copper Leach pad construction is nearly complete and ore placement has begun. Construction of the solvent extraction electro-winning plant is scheduled to begin in late 2012.
Turning to Slide 13, I'll round out my discussion of Nevada growth projects with Long Canyon. Based on the work conducted by Fronteer, as well as our work since the acquisition, we continue to believe in our original investment thesis that Long Canyon holds the potential to grow beyond 3x to 4x Fronteer's estimates. We are confident because our drilling results, and you can see a plan view on Slide 13, has doubled the extent of the known mineralization from 1 kilometer to 2 kilometers along strike which, when you look on the slide, is in the northeast, southwest, upper-right, lower-left direction, along the length of the ore body, with mineralization remaining open along strike. In addition, a number of new targets which are outlined on here, dotted and dashed in red, have been generated that will be drilled in 2012. 
For 2012, we're planning to complete approximately 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling, with the objective of completing an associated pre-feasibility study to declare first NRM in conjunction with our 2012 year-end reporting.
Finally, and importantly, we submitted our plan of operations during the first quarter to maintain our aggressive push-forward on the project, representing a major step in securing the necessary permits. The scope for this submission calls for both leach and mill operations.
Turning to our South American region on Slide 14, Q1 attributable production of 201,000 ounces was 26% higher than a year ago as we processed some higher-grade material from the El Tapado pit and it's also in alignment with our mine plan, which more than offset some lower leach pad production during the quarter. CAS decreased with higher production, partially offset by higher labor, diesel and workers' participation costs and lower silver byproduct credits.
Moving to Slide 15, our Asia-Pacific region delivered 442,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter. This was down 15% from a year ago due to lower production at Batu Hijau, which I've already discussed, and combined with no maintenance at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. We also need to mention that Boddington in the first quarter production was lower than planned due to an extended mill maintenance shut and a subsequent conveyor drive motor failure for a day that decreased our production for the quarter. This is not anticipated in the further quarters. Both the higher gold and copper CAS of $774 per ounce and $1.98 per pound, respectively, were a function of lower production and higher mill maintenance costs that I just mentioned.
At Batu Hijau, we recently experienced the pit wall failure that limits access to the bottom of the mine. However, Batu is currently in a stripping phase and we are processing stockpiled material, so this does not cause any immediate production impact. As a reminder, since Batu is currently in the stripping phase, it is a very small contributor at less than 1% of our overall gold production outlook for the year. At the Tanami shaft project in Australia, construction of the camp is complete and we're in the process of finalizing vendor selection for the new crusher and we've awarded the underground mine development contract.
Turning to Slide 16, we've summarized first quarter performance at Ahafo in Africa, where production of 175,000 ounces was down about 6% from Q1 2011 due to mine sequencing that I mentioned earlier. CAS was $568, up from a year ago due to lower production and higher direct mining costs, along with an increase in royalties and taxes related to higher gold prices.
Turning to Slide 17, you'll see an image of construction on the ball mill and SAG Mill foundations at the Akyem project in Ghana. Construction is progressing very well. We've recently poured first concrete at the primary crusher, started work on the conveyor quarter, poured the final floor sections of the mine services area workshop and completed the reclaimed tunnel slab core. We received approval to start pit clearing and work on the pit area and pit access roads which began in February. Meanwhile, we are currently advancing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo north area.
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

As you know, we've been going through a divestiture process over the last several years. And as a result of that, we have almost continuous interaction with both the local community, who have an interest in the current shares that have been divested, as well as an interest in the potential shares. The central government, who is the buyer at least at the moment for the 7%, and we hope that, that will close sometime in the next few months. I think as we see that 7% close, I think we will then be through the divestiture issues and then solidly into what does the rest of Indonesia look like. We think Indonesia continues to be prospective within our contracted work. We are continuing to explore it along, which we think has potential to be similar to Batu Hijau in terms of its output, but probably, twice as big and half the grade, so obviously dependent on economics. But we continue to look at that. Why? Because we believe that the political situation in Indonesia continues to support mining. We do have a contract of work, and the government has indicated that they would like to see certain forms or provisions of that change, including the potential for refining more copper product in Indonesia. And what I can tell you is that the one refinery that is available in Indonesia to process is full. So we continue to work with the government on what we're going to do next. If that's really what's going to happen, somebody's going to have to construct a refinery. So what I'd say is the dialogue with Indonesia continues to be a dialogue. But I'd say generally, it's been constructive. We have worked through the issues. We've been there quite some time. I think on the ground, we provide meaningful jobs and meaningful revenue to the government, and we continue to be cited as one of the most environmentally and, I think, financially, in terms of filing our tax returns and paying on time, of any mining company in Peru -- so I think -- or sorry, I meant in Indonesia. But you could also say that in Peru. So we continue to be positive, I think, about Indonesia. No question, we've got to keep an eye on what's happening there, and elections are going to be coming up there in the next couple years as well."

For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. As we announced last year during our Investor Day in New York, we continue to focus our efforts on offering shareholders a combination of competitive production growth and returns, exploration upside, balance sheet strength and a commitment to return capital back to shareholders. 
Our first quarter financial and operating results supported our efforts in each of these areas, with consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter; operating margins, up 29% on a 22% increase in the average realized gold price of $1,684 per ounce; stable gold production of 1.3 million ounces; operating costs well within our guidance; and a 75% increase in our dividend over the prior year's quarter to $0.35 per share. We are maintaining our 2012 outlook for production, costs applicable to sales and capital spending. 
Regarding our exploration upside, we continue to see the potential to add the equivalent of 90 million ounces of gold to reserves between 2011 and 2020. And in 2011, as disclosed previously, we made significant progress by adding 11.6 million ounces of gold to reserves or approximately 10% of that target.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and to provide additional financial flexibility. We recently took advantage of favorable debt markets to raise $2.5 billion of senior notes, to repay borrowings and replenish the balance sheet. Russell will speak to this in a few moments.
Turning to Slide 4, as many of you know, our growth potential includes a number of new projects, including the Akyem project in Ghana where construction is now 40% complete and going very well. Our growth potential also includes our Conga project and other projects in Peru. 
As most of you have heard, the Conga project's environmental impact assessment, which was previously approved by the central government of Peru in October 2010 after an extensive public engagement process, was subject to a review by independent experts during the first quarter of 2012 at the request of the central government. The results of the independent review were released last week and confirmed that the EIA met Peruvian and international standards. The report also goes on to recommend, among other considerations, that we assess the technical and economic feasibility of relocating the Perol waste dump in order to try to preserve the Azul and Chica lakes. We are currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations contained in the independent report and additional recommendations from the government to assess the future impacts on the project's economics.
Conga is a significant investment in Peru and would be, we believe, a catalyst for economic and social development in the Cajamarca region, while also protecting water quality and providing year-round water availability for downstream users. 
Conga's development would be a significant source of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant employment. We've been privileged to work in Peru for more than 20 years, and we want to continue to be part of the government's social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through responsible mining.
If Conga cannot be developed, though, in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner while also earning our shareholders an acceptable return, then we will reallocate that capital to other development projects in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, and we can combine that with a possible return of additional capital to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our first quarter financial and operating results."
291795,183168440,291734,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone.

Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs. 
Adjusted net income of $578 million, or $1.17 a share, was slightly ahead of expectations, driven largely by those lower operating costs. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income reported under U.S. GAAP is included as an appendix on Slide 22 and reflects a $71 million charge, net of tax benefits of $4 million, for discontinued operations from an increased accrual related to the Holt property royalty. More detail on this can be found in Note 10 on Page 11 of the 10-Q. And in addition, a write-down of $24 million in marketable securities acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, net of the miscellaneous asset sales.  Cash from continuing operations of $613 million for the quarter was off 38% from the year-ago quarter, largely due to working capital changes. I'll provide some color on this shortly.
Moving to Slide 6, attributable gold production of 1.3 million ounces is essentially in line with a year ago despite a much lower contribution from Batu Hijau. Gold costs applicable to sales of $620 an ounce, while up 11% from the year-ago quarter, were approximately $20 an ounce below budget for the quarter. More on that in a moment. Our gold operating margin continues to expand with a 29% increase to $1,064 an ounce on a 22% increase in the realized gold price to $1,684 an ounce. 
Slide 7 provides more detail on the decrease in operating cash flow from the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we benefited by almost $400 million from a higher realized gold price. However, this was offset by lower copper revenues due to lower production at Batu Hijau, with the realized copper price essentially flat. We had a net increase in working capital of $377 million due to $100 million increase in stockpile and leach pad inventory on hand and a similar increase in doré and concentrate receivables on hand at quarter end.
And finally, the balance of the working capital change was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of almost $200 million in early 2011 related to the collection of late fourth quarter 2010 concentrate sales from Batu Hijau. More detail on working capital changes can be found in Note 22 on Page 24 of the 10-Q.
Slide 8 outlines the drivers of the 11% increase in CAS from the year-ago quarter. The higher realized gold price added $16 an ounce due to highest [ph] workers' participation in Peru, an increase in royalties tied to the gold price and the higher allocation of cost to gold from copper at Batu Hijau and Boddington where we allocate operating costs on a coproduct basis. Higher spending added $12 an ounce largely in the form of higher labor and contracted services. Byproduct credits were $10 an ounce lower, largely due to lower silver price and also lower silver volumes for the quarter. Higher-than-assumed diesel costs added $9 an ounce, with a stronger-than-assumed Australian dollar adding $7 an ounce net of hedge credits. And finally, lower sales volumes due to the lower production at Batu Hijau and an increase in inventory on hand added about $9 an ounce.
You should expect a renewed focus on cost reduction going forward. When we think about costs, we think about them across the entire product life cycle, from exploration to advance projects, operating costs and G&A. Look for more details on our efforts in this regard at our Analyst Day to be held in New York on May 23.
Turning to Slide 9, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our gold price-linked dividend policy. Based on a realized gold price of $1,684 for the quarter, the board approved a second quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on June 28 to holders of record at the close of business on June 12. The dividend represents an increase of 75% from the year-ago quarter and a resulting yield of approximately 3% based on today's share price.
Finally, I would like to take a minute to comment on our capital structure in light of our very successful debt capital market transaction in March. First, a quick bit of history. In 2011, we repaid $217 million of our 8 5/8% debentures and completed the Fronteer acquisition for cash outlay of approximately $2.1 billion. The first quarter of this year, we repaid $517 million in convertible senior notes and $105 million in debt related to the refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada. 
With interest rates at near record lows, we decided to access the debt capital markets to refinance some of that debt we had retired over the last 2 years, and at the same time, to term out our debt profile. We raised net proceeds of just under $1.5 billion due in 2022 at a pretax cost of 3.5% and just under $1 billion due in 2042 at a pretax cost of 4 7/8%. The debt raising provides significant financial strength and flexibility to deliver on our growth profile through a combination of strong operating cash flows in the current gold price environment, cash on hand at the quarter end of approximately $2.6 billion and a solid investment grade credit rating.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the regional performance in more detail and to provide a project update."

From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North",1101,"Thanks, Russell. From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.
On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North and South America, while Africa's production was down slightly due to production of slightly lower-grade material in line with the mine plan. Those production impacts were reflected in our CAS, with APAC incurring the largest increase in CAS as we spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau across a lower production base.
Turning to Slide 11, our North American production was 489,000 ounces in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in Nevada, along with higher leach placement at La Herradura and the start of production at Noche Buena in Mexico. CAS was $613 per ounce, down just slightly from a year ago due to lower inventory drawdown costs. Recall that a year ago, Newmont was in the final stages of remediation at Gold Quarry, so in the first quarter of 2011, we mined less material than in 2012. 
Looking to Q2, we expect to complete repairs at the Leeville vent shaft by June. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the second quarter production is historically Nevada's lowest quarter, and it will be again this year, due primarily to annual scheduled maintenance at the Mill 6 roaster in Nevada, which usually lasts about 30 days. Over the last couple of years, it has been roughly 10% to 20% lower production than the other 3 quarters of the year. The impact of this downtime has been incorporated in the full year gold production outlook for Nevada of 1.725 million to 1.8 million ounces.
Turning to Slide 12, you'll see an update on North American projects. At Emigrant, which is part of our Nevada expansions, we currently expect commissioning in July. Development of the Vista 7 vein at Twin Creeks is also on track, and we expect it to make a small contribution beginning in the second quarter. The Phoenix Copper Leach pad construction is nearly complete and ore placement has begun. Construction of the solvent extraction electro-winning plant is scheduled to begin in late 2012.
Turning to Slide 13, I'll round out my discussion of Nevada growth projects with Long Canyon. Based on the work conducted by Fronteer, as well as our work since the acquisition, we continue to believe in our original investment thesis that Long Canyon holds the potential to grow beyond 3x to 4x Fronteer's estimates. We are confident because our drilling results, and you can see a plan view on Slide 13, has doubled the extent of the known mineralization from 1 kilometer to 2 kilometers along strike which, when you look on the slide, is in the northeast, southwest, upper-right, lower-left direction, along the length of the ore body, with mineralization remaining open along strike. In addition, a number of new targets which are outlined on here, dotted and dashed in red, have been generated that will be drilled in 2012. 
For 2012, we're planning to complete approximately 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling, with the objective of completing an associated pre-feasibility study to declare first NRM in conjunction with our 2012 year-end reporting.
Finally, and importantly, we submitted our plan of operations during the first quarter to maintain our aggressive push-forward on the project, representing a major step in securing the necessary permits. The scope for this submission calls for both leach and mill operations.
Turning to our South American region on Slide 14, Q1 attributable production of 201,000 ounces was 26% higher than a year ago as we processed some higher-grade material from the El Tapado pit and it's also in alignment with our mine plan, which more than offset some lower leach pad production during the quarter. CAS decreased with higher production, partially offset by higher labor, diesel and workers' participation costs and lower silver byproduct credits.
Moving to Slide 15, our Asia-Pacific region delivered 442,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter. This was down 15% from a year ago due to lower production at Batu Hijau, which I've already discussed, and combined with no maintenance at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. We also need to mention that Boddington in the first quarter production was lower than planned due to an extended mill maintenance shut and a subsequent conveyor drive motor failure for a day that decreased our production for the quarter. This is not anticipated in the further quarters. Both the higher gold and copper CAS of $774 per ounce and $1.98 per pound, respectively, were a function of lower production and higher mill maintenance costs that I just mentioned.
At Batu Hijau, we recently experienced the pit wall failure that limits access to the bottom of the mine. However, Batu is currently in a stripping phase and we are processing stockpiled material, so this does not cause any immediate production impact. As a reminder, since Batu is currently in the stripping phase, it is a very small contributor at less than 1% of our overall gold production outlook for the year. At the Tanami shaft project in Australia, construction of the camp is complete and we're in the process of finalizing vendor selection for the new crusher and we've awarded the underground mine development contract.
Turning to Slide 16, we've summarized first quarter performance at Ahafo in Africa, where production of 175,000 ounces was down about 6% from Q1 2011 due to mine sequencing that I mentioned earlier. CAS was $568, up from a year ago due to lower production and higher direct mining costs, along with an increase in royalties and taxes related to higher gold prices.
Turning to Slide 17, you'll see an image of construction on the ball mill and SAG Mill foundations at the Akyem project in Ghana. Construction is progressing very well. We've recently poured first concrete at the primary crusher, started work on the conveyor quarter, poured the final floor sections of the mine services area workshop and completed the reclaimed tunnel slab core. We received approval to start pit clearing and work on the pit area and pit access roads which began in February. Meanwhile, we are currently advancing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo north area.
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

As you know, we've been going through a divestiture process over the last several years. And as a result of that, we have almost continuous interaction with both the local community, who have an interest in the current shares that have been divested, as well as an interest in the potential shares. The central government, who is the buyer at least at the moment for the 7%, and we hope that, that will close sometime in the next few months. I think as we see that 7% close, I think we will then be through the divestiture issues and then solidly into what does the rest of Indonesia look like. We think Indonesia continues to be prospective within our contracted work. We are continuing to explore it along, which we think has potential to be similar to Batu Hijau in terms of its output, but probably, twice as big and half the grade, so obviously dependent on economics. But we continue to look at that. Why? Because we believe that the political situation in Indonesia continues to support mining. We do have a contract of work, and the government has indicated that they would like to see certain forms or provisions of that change, including the potential for refining more copper product in Indonesia. And what I can tell you is that the one refinery that is available in Indonesia to process is full. So we continue to work with the government on what we're going to do next. If that's really what's going to happen, somebody's going to have to construct a refinery. So what I'd say is the dialogue with Indonesia continues to be a dialogue. But I'd say generally, it's been constructive. We have worked through the issues. We've been there quite some time. I think on the ground, we provide meaningful jobs and meaningful revenue to the government, and we continue to be cited as one of the most environmentally and, I think, financially, in terms of filing our tax returns and paying on time, of any mining company in Peru -- so I think -- or sorry, I meant in Indonesia. But you could also say that in Peru. So we continue to be positive, I think, about Indonesia.

Before we jump into the quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on the recent announcement regarding Gary Goldberg's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I worked with the board to Gary to Newmont last year, and I recommended this promotion in recognition of the scope of his responsibilities and the substantial contributions he's already made in Newmont. As you know, Gary joined Newmont in December of last year with a 30-year track record of success at Rio Tinto. Throughout his career, Gary has been widely recognized for his achievements in safety, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. He's quickly come up to speed on our business opportunities and challenges and has proven himself to be an outstanding addition to Newmont's senior leadership team. 
As a reminder, today, Gary is responsible for worldwide operations, projects both safety and loss prevention, security solutions and innovation and business excellence. Gary and I have developed an excellent working relationship, and I look forward to continuing our work together as we build on our existing foundation of capital discipline, balance sheet strength, profitable operations, extensive exploration and project opportunities in our industry leading dividend policy. Many of you have already met Gary some at our recent Investor Day and going forward, you will have many opportunities to get to know him better. 
This week, we also announced the election of Kofi Bucknor to our Board of Directors. Kofi brings significant financial expertise, as well as extensive knowledge of Ghana in Africa. 
I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the passing of the Ghanaian President John Mills. We appreciated the support from President Mills over the past years and know that he will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country. 
Now turning to Slide 3. As we talk about at May on our Investor Day in New York, we reaffirm our commitment to offer shareholders a combination of profitable growth, disciplined returns, strong exploration potential, balance sheet strength and our industry-leading gold price link dividend. Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results performed in line with our budget. Exploration is on track to cover reserve depletion and exceed 100 million ounces of reserves in 2012. 
As expected, our second quarter gold production was impacted by annual planned mill maintenance in Nevada, lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia and lower gold and copper production from Batu Hijau in Indonesia as we continue with the planned stripping to Phase 6. While we had a few items in the quarter that impacted our earnings, which Russell with speak to later in the call, we remain generally on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals established at the beginning of this year. 
As noted in our earnings release yesterday, we're narrowing our 2012 outlook for attributable gold production to 5 million to 5.1 million ounces while maintaining our outlook for CAS of $625 to $675 per ounce. We also lowered our 2012 attributable capital expenditure outlook by approximately $300 million, primarily as a result of our slower development timetable at Conga and Peru. 
We expect our advance projects expenditures to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower in 2012, primarily as a result of our deferred development plans in Peru, as well as our refined scopes of work at several of our early-stage projects in Nevada and in our Asia-Pacific region. Similarly, we expect our exploration and G&A spending to be lower by approximately $40 million to $50 million this year and 10 to 12 -- $10 million to $20 million in G&A. So $40 million to $50 million for exploration, $10 million in G&A. 
We're also mindful to balance our desire for increased efficiency with our continued commitment to build a healthy, more efficient and growing business, which is entirely consistent with what we discussed with you at Investor Day. So as a result, our adjusted outlook for advance projects exploration and G&A spending has been reduced by approximately $100 million for 2012. 
As we continue to optimize our portfolio of projects and businesses, as we refine our plans and focus on total cost reductions, we do expect to identify further efficiencies and cost savings for 2013. And we will share that with you when we communicate our 2013 expectations.
We are also remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return. Earlier this week, we also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average afternoon Gold fix of $1,609 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of approximately 3%. 
Turning to Slide 4. As many of you know, our project pipeline includes a number of advanced-stage development opportunities such as the Akyem project in Ghana, which Gary will talk about in a bit, as well as some earlier-stage opportunities that we continue to optimize and refine. Our portfolio has the potential to reach 6 million to 7 million ounces of attributable gold production over the next 5 years depending on future events in Peru, as well as the results of our ongoing earlier-stage project optimization efforts across each of our regions. We will keep you informed of our progress in evaluation of our earlier-stage projects including Subika, the Ahafo mill project, Waihi, Merian and Long Canyon, as well as various regional expansion opportunities.
Turning to Slide 5. Conga is still in our plans but moving ahead on a very measured basis. We are focused on the construction of additional reservoirs, completing the construction of the camp in engineering and the final procurement of major equipment while, at the same time, working closely with the government and the community to build this project in a safe, eventually and socially acceptable manner. 
In support of this effort, for 2012 and 2013, we have as we've communicated previously revised our estimates for capital spending at Conga to $440 million on an attributable basis. Thus far in 2012, we might have spent approximately $185 million in development of water reservoirs, engineering, equipment and camp construction. However, I must continue to caution that ongoing community unrest and protests could further delay advancement of those activities. 
Our relationship with the communities in Peru is extremely important to us. We hope to continue working cooperatively with the Government of Peru and the local communities, as well as with the regional government through mediation and dialogue process to develop a peaceful and amenable solution to the political, social and other issues that have led to protests and community unrest in the areas outside of our immediate area of influence around Conga. We note the recent Peruvian government cabinet changes and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government with the new Prime Minister and continuing to support President social inclusion plan with responsible mining playing a key part. 
As we've said, further development of the Conga project will occur only with local and national support and only if it can be done in a safe, socially, environmentally responsible manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our second quarter financial and operating results."
291795,210280905,332769,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Good day, everyone.

You'll see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. 
Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due to scheduled maintenance in Nevada and seasonality issues at a number of our operations. Clearly, this quarter was no exception. 
Having said that, from a production and CAS perspective, we are on budget for the first 6 months, and we are significantly below budget on capital expenditures, a trend I expect to continue and not just because of the slowdown of Conga. Reading the sales this morning provide some interesting perspectives on the quarter. I think Stephen Walker at RBC summed it up quite nicely and I quote, not as bad as it looks as do John Bridges of JPMorgan. Numerous negative adjustments, but operations looking firm. I will explain why and provide a little perspective on the quarter's results. 
Revenue was down 6% on lower gold and copper volumes and a lower realized copper price, partially offset by a higher gold price. Net income was in line with budget, almost significantly lower than the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to a $200 million quarter-on-quarter reduction in pretax income at Batu Hijau in Indonesia. We've discussed previously you shouldn't expect a turnaround at Batu Hijau until we get into Phase 6 ore currently scheduled for early 2014. 
Adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, largely line with budget but approximately $0.30 short of the consensus earnings estimate. I want to spend a couple of minutes stepping into 5 items that account for about $0.24 or 3/4 of that shortfall. 
We incurred about approximately $52 million in care maintenance costs as we wind that project down. As you know, we wrote our investment offer the year end but in terms of U.S. GAAP, we're not allowed to accrue for all future care and maintenance cost. So we have to expense these as incurred going forward. Due to the fact that we have no Canadian sourced income, we also have to raise valuation allowance against related tax asset. So pre- and post-tax numbers are essentially the same. The resulting impact to earnings of that $52 million was about $0.10 a share. 
Going forward, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on closure cost at Hope Bay in the second half of the year before entering into a steady-state care and maintenance run rate of approximately $20 million a year starting in 2013. We had a timing issue related to sales of concentrate that resulted in inventory build for the quarter of approximately 40,000 ounces of gold and 9 million pounds of copper, reducing earnings by approximately $0.05. Going forward to address this, we will be releasing quarterly production and sales volumes prior to releasing the quarterly financial results. The movements in finished goods inventory, which can be a significant are more visible surprise when we report earnings. 
Operating cost for the second quarter were $5 above the high end of the annual guidance range at 6 81 an ounce or $30 above the midpoint of the range. This $30 above the midpoint reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share. For the full year, we maintained our original outlook of 6 25 to 6 75 an ounce despite narrowing the expected production range to 5 million to 5.1 million ounces due to the operating challenges at Tanami. I suspect we'll end up slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range, so we still have 2 quarters to go. 
$18 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on copper promotional pricing reduced earnings by $0.02 a share. And finally, the quarterly tax rate was at the top end of the previous guidance range. The delta above the midpoint of the previous range to where we ended up for the quarter reduced earnings by 1/3 or $0.02 a share. We have narrowed the tax rate outlook for 2012 to 30% to 32% while continuing to work on a number of tax planning opportunities for the second half of the year. 
So clearly a lot of noise of this quarter, but I remain confident we will deliver what we promised for the full year. This is a long-term business that is volatile by nature, but being public, it's one that gets judged every 90 days.
Slide 7, as noted previously, the operations generally performed in line with budget. Attributable gold production of 1.18 million ounces was, however, marginally below the year-ago quarter. Gold CAS applicable to sales of $681 an ounce were up 17% with higher-than-budgeted cost at Boddington, Ahafo, Tanami and Waihi offset by strong quarter at Yanacocha, Jundee and KCGM. 
Copper costs applicable to sales reflect the ongoing Phase 6 waste removal and processing of low-grade  stockpiles at Batu Hijau. Gary will finish the time covering the operating results in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 8. As outlined in our dividend release earlier this week, we modified our gold price link dividend policy to provide greater visibility and transparency to the realized gold price used to calculate the amount of the dividend. Under the old policy, we linked to the dividend our net realized gold price, which is calculated after treatment under refining charges and any mark-to-market adjustment on provisional pricing. Going forward, we have linked the dividend to the average London P.M. gold fix for the quarter, which is an independently published number. This will eliminate any bias for us and hopefully provide greater clarity and visibility into the expected dividend although as noted previously, the actual dividend remains subject to board approval. 
Moving to Slide 9. The second quarter average London P.M. gold fix of $1,609 announced translates into $1.40 annualized dividend or $0.35 for the quarter. The dividend is payable on September 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary."

Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call. 
I joined Newmont last year because of the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable development, the quality of its people and attractive opportunities for profitable growth in sustainable increases in shareholder value. The company also has a strong commitment to safety, profitability and growth, which are 3 areas that have been priorities for me throughout my career. 
Since I joined Newmont, I've had the opportunity to visit many of our locations, and what I've seen over only reinforces my optimism about the company's strengths and opportunities and the quality of our people. From a financial perspective, Newmont has differentiated itself from industry peers with its financial discipline. The company has a strong balance sheet and has delivered industry-leading per share performance and gold reserves, attributable gold production and operating cash flow. 
Newmont's gold price link dividend is unique in the industry and gives their shareholders direct leverage to gold prices. As Richard said, the board and management team are aligned around Newmont's strategic direction, and we are all focused on executing the plan and driving value for our shareholders. 
To be clear, while I'm excited about Newmont's strengths, opportunities and prospects, I am also well aware of the challenges including rising total cost and increasing political and social pressures we and others in the industry face, also including political and social pressures in some locations. I've been working closely on these issues with Richard and the rest of the Newmont team, and we'll continue to do so as we sharpen our focus on profitable growth. 
As Richard mentioned at Investor Day, we have a regional operating teams and teams focused on addressing our total cost. This includes operating costs, sustaining costs, our G&A costs and our project execution costs. We're leaving no stone unturned, and we'll share this with you as we provide our guidance for 2013. 
I'm very excited to be a part of the Newmont team and the opportunities in front of the company. I appreciate the confidence Richard and the board have placed in me. I hope to earn your confidence as well by doing everything I can to create value for you in the years to come. 
And now I'd like to recognize the quick-responding colleagues at our Waihi mine. As most of you may have heard last week, we had a truck fire in the Treo underground mine in Waihi in New Zealand, which required 28 of our colleagues to take refuge in safety chambers and await rescue. Thankfully, our people acted quickly, and all were safely rescued within 7 hours. This incident ended without injury because of the training and the quick and professional response of the team at Waihi. 
Turning to Slide 10. You'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts were reflected in our cost with Asia-Pacific incurring the largest increase of cost as we experienced nonrecurring mill maintenance cost at Boddington and spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau and Waihi across a lower production base. As Russell mentioned, our second quarter CAS was higher than the market's expectations. However, costs were within our budget, and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 11 in North America. We had a good quarter relative to last year looking at production. That said, the second quarter production was down from the first quarter. This is historically Nevada slowest quarter as we do our annual Mill 6 maintenance. This was performed as scheduled during the April, late April, early May time frame. We're happy to report also that the ventilation shaft repairs at Leeville are complete, and operations are back on track. 
We also received positive news at Long Canyon. The notice of intent to prepare Environmental Impact Statement was issued for Long Canyon on July 19. This opens the door to a 45-day public comment process. To quote Tom Kerr, our Senior Vice President of North America, engaging the public early will help us to ensure our high standards meet community expectations. We also received our permits, which allow us to continue to expand our exploration efforts around Long Canyon.
Turning to our South America Region on Slide 12. Q2 attributable production of 213,000 ounces was 10% higher than a year ago as we process higher-grade material and achieve higher recoveries. While we are ahead year-to-date at Yanacocha due to mine sequencing of the higher-grade material in the first half, we expect to finish the year in line with the current production guidance.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Asia-Pacific region was impacted by lower tons mined at both Tanami and Waihi. Tanami production was well below plan due to issues related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned stopes. Steps have been taken to address this shortfall, but it will take some time to address shaft. Development is progressing albeit at a slower rate given the backfill issues. 
At Waihi, we had a shortfall of ore mining in the open pit due to a quarter 1 wall failure and a delay in development work in the underground mine. Both the Tanami and Waihi shortfalls will not be made up in 2012, and we have adjusted our production guidance accordingly. Our costs were impacted by lower production in Tanami and Waihi, the higher stripping at Batu Hijau, as well as the mill maintenance cost I previously mentioned at Boddington, which included tertiary crusher overhaul, major liner replacements and a mill motor replacement, as well as the related downtime.
Regarding the divestiture of the last 7% tranche at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court has given notice that it will read its decision next Tuesday on the Central Government's capability to buy the 7%. This decision should provide clarity on who will be the owner of this 7% stake in PTNNT. The current guidance assumes 48.5% ownership for the remainder of 2012.
On Slide 14, we've summarized second quarter performance of Ahafo in Africa where production of 132,000 ounces was down 9.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower throughput and grade. Cost was $583 per ounce, up from a year ago due to lower production in the higher direct mining cost. The ICAM project is currently 53% complete and is tracking on schedule and on budget with first production expected in late 2013. 
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

And so it looks to me like you're very sensitive to any further changes in net cash costs. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how sacrosanct the current dividend policy is and then if it is sacrosanct, how would you view prioritizing your CapEx expense. And if you could give us an idea of may be rough numbers what you'd be looking into 2013, do you think 2012 is really a lumpy year in terms of CapEx and things will smooth out going forward?"

Look, we set the dividend policy, and we've been very clear about this since we set it. We set the dividend policy in ways that are sustainable over the longer term otherwise it would be policy that would just be a moment, and so it is a policy. And as it suggests, that dividend policy does, in fact, enforce and we like this, capital spending and other spending requirements to ensure that we can keep the balance. But remember when we set this longer term, we didn't incorporate copper cash flows as we set the policy. We set it to make sure that the increments up in gold price were affordable based on our plans. And with respect to lumpy capital spending, we've been I think clear that 2012 and '13 on the old Conga plan were the years where we would have the predominance of capital spending with respect to our 6 million to 7 million-ounce delivery in 2017 with capital tailing off beginning in 2015. So there are 2 lumpy years, sorry, '14 -- '12 and '13. We still believe that although with Conga deferred, we're now actually generating $300 million of additional cash flow this year less after tax. So, Jorge, what I would say is we continue to believe in the dividend policy. We continue to watch capital spending and we will, and we continue to believe that we can balance returns on capital with returns of capital to shareholders to generate true economic value over the short and longer term, and we're going to continue to focus on that. With respect to the net debt position, I'm going to ask Russ to talk about what we've been able to accomplish here to actually ensure that we have a very strong balance sheet and low-cost debt on the balance sheet."

So I really look at that as another $1 billion off of your net debt. We will monetize those at some stage. And again part of the cost reduction exercise is a focus on free cash flow generation, and you should expect us to be focused on that and keep asking your questions around the net debt. We believe that some debt levels for a company this size is appropriate, and we'll continue to evaluate that trade-off. We still are along.

To date, that has not happened, but we have been able to continue as I said on almost all days to continue to work on the reservoir construction.

And under Mills, we had several layers of discussions going on with the government to ensure that changes in law around royalties and taxes were well understood, that those impacts under our current agreement were well understood. That dialogue is going on and I would suggest will continue to go on, and I think that it's that positive dialogue that allows us to continue to say that Ghana continues to be one of the best places for us in our future in terms of exploration potential, in terms of the ability to develop projects, in terms of a long-term support and commitment of the government and in terms of really having great people supporting us in the projects. So Ghana continues to be not just a shining light for democracy, but I think a shining light for Newmont.
Okay. So that's the extent of our time today. Really appreciate your listening to our call and attending, and thanks for continued attention as we continue to deliver ongoing performance under our plans."

Before we jump into the quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on the recent announcement regarding Gary Goldberg's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I worked with the board to recruit Gary to Newmont last year, and I recommended this promotion in recognition of the scope of his responsibilities and the substantial contributions he's already made in Newmont. As you know, Gary joined Newmont in December of last year with a 30-year track record of success at Rio Tinto. Throughout his career, Gary has been widely recognized for his achievements in safety, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. He's quickly come up to speed on our business opportunities and challenges and has proven himself to be an outstanding addition to Newmont's senior leadership team. As a reminder, today Gary is responsible for worldwide operations; projects of safety and loss prevention, security solutions and innovation; and business excellence.
Gary and I have developed an excellent working relationship and I look forward to continuing our work together as we build on our existing foundation of capital discipline, balance sheet strength, profitable operations, extensive exploration and project opportunities in our industry-leading dividend policy. Many of you have already met Gary, some at our recent Investor Day, and going forward, you will have many opportunities to get to know him better.
This week, we also announced the election of Kofi Bucknor to our Board of Directors. Kofi brings significant financial expertise as well as extensive knowledge of Ghana in Africa.
I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the passing of the Ghanaian President John Atta Mills. We appreciated the support from President Mills over the past years and know that he will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country.
Now turning to Slide 3. As we talked about in May at our Investor Day in New York, we reaffirmed our commitment to offer shareholders a combination of profitable growth, disciplined returns, strong exploration potential, balance sheet strength and our industry-leading gold price-linked dividend.
Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results performed in line with our budget. Exploration is on track to cover reserve depletion and exceed 100 million ounces of reserves in 2012. As expected, our second quarter gold production was impacted by annual planned mill maintenance in Nevada, lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia and lower gold and copper production from Batu Hijau in Indonesia as we continue with the planned stripping to Phase 6. While we had a few items in the quarter that impacted our earnings, which Russell with speak to later in the call, we remain generally on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals established at the beginning of this year.
As noted in our earnings release yesterday, we're narrowing our 2012 outlook for attributable gold production to 5 to 5.1 million ounces while maintaining our outlook for CAS of $625 to $675 per ounce. We've also lowered our 2012 attributable capital expenditure outlook by approximately $300 million primarily as a result of our slower development timetable at Conga in Peru.
We expect our advanced projects expenditures to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower in 2012 primarily as a result of our deferred development plans in Peru as well as our refined scopes of work at several of our early-stage projects in Nevada and in our Asia Pacific region. Similarly, we expect our exploration and G&A spending to be lower by approximately $40 million to $50 million this year and 10 to 12 -- $10 million to $20 million in G&A: so $40 million to $50 million for exploration, $10 million in G&A.
We're also mindful to balance our desire for increased efficiency with our continued commitment to build a healthy, more efficient and growing business, which is entirely consistent with what we discussed with you at Investor Day. So as a result, our adjusted outlook for advanced projects exploration and G&A spending has been reduced by approximately $100 million for 2012. As we continue to optimize our portfolio of projects and businesses, as we refine our plans and focus on total cost reductions, we do expect to identify further efficiencies and cost savings for 2013. And we will share that with you when we communicate our 2013 expectations.
We also remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return. Earlier this week, we also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average afternoon gold fix of $1,609 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of approximately 3%.
Turning to Slide 4. As many of you know, our project pipeline includes a number of advance-stage development opportunities such as the Akyem project in Ghana, which Gary will talk about in a bit, as well as some earlier-stage opportunities that we continue to optimize and refine. Our portfolio has the potential to reach 6 to 7 million ounces of attributable gold production over the next 5 years, depending on future events in Peru as well as the results of our ongoing earlier-stage project optimization efforts across each of our regions. We will keep you informed of our progress and evaluation of our earlier-stage projects, including Subika, the Ahafo Mill project, Waihi, Merian and Long Canyon as well as various regional expansion opportunities.
Turning to Slide 5. Conga is still in our plans but moving ahead on a very measured basis. We are focused on the construction of additional reservoirs, completing the construction of the camp in engineering and the final procurement of major equipment while at the same time working closely with the government and the community to build this project in a safe environmentally and socially acceptable manner.
In support of this effort, for 2012 and 2013 we have, as we've communicated previously, revised our estimates for capital spending at Conga to $440 million on an attributable basis. Thus far in 2012 we might have spent approximately $185 million in development of water reservoirs, engineering, equipment and camp construction. However, I must continue to caution that ongoing community unrest and protests could further delay advancement of those activities.
Our relationship with the communities in Peru is extremely important to us. We hope to continue working cooperatively with the government of Peru and the local communities as well as with the regional government through the mediation and dialogue process to develop a peaceful and amenable solution to the political, social and other issues that have led to protests and community unrest in the areas outside of our immediate area of influence around Conga. We note the recent Peruvian government cabinet changes and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government with the new Prime Minister and continuing to support President Humala's social inclusion plan with responsible mining playing a key part.
As we've said, further development of the Conga project will occur only with local and national support and only if it can be done in a safe, socially, environmentally responsible manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our second quarter financial and operating results."
291795,210280905,333015,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Good day, everyone.Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due t",1009,"Thanks, Richard. Good day, everyone.
Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due to scheduled roster maintenance in Nevada and seasonality issues at a number of our operations. Clearly, this quarter was no exception.
Having said that, from a production and CAS perspective we're on budget for the first 6 months and we are significantly below budget on capital expenditures, a trend I expect to continue and not just because of the slowdown in Conga.
Reading the sales coverage this morning provided some interesting perspectives on the quarter. I think Stephen Walker at RBC summed it up quite nicely, and I quote, ""Earnings miss not as bad as it looks,"" as did John Bridges at JPMorgan: ""Numerous negative adjustments, but operations looking firm."" I will explain why and provide a little perspective on the quarter's results.
Revenue was down 6% on lower gold and copper volumes and a lower realized copper price, partially offset by a higher gold price. Net income was in line with budget although significantly lower than the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to a $200 million quarter-on-quarter reduction in pretax income at Batu Hijau in Indonesia. We've discussed previously you shouldn't expect a turnaround at Batu Hijau until we get into Phase 6 ore currently scheduled for early 2014.
Adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, largely in line with budget but approximately $0.30 short of the consensus earnings estimate. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes stepping into 5 items that account for about $0.24 or 3/4 of that shortfall.
We incurred approximately $52 million in care and maintenance costs at Hope Bay as we wind that project down. As you know, we wrote our investment offer at the year end, but in terms of U.S. GAAP, we were not allowed to accrue for all future care and maintenance costs so we have to expense these as incurred, going forward. Due to the fact that we have no Canadian-sourced income, we also have to raise the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, so pre- and post-tax numbers on Hope Bay are essentially the same. The resulting impact to earnings of that $52 million was about $0.10 a share.
Going forward, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on closure costs at Hope Bay in the second half of the year before entering into a steady-state care and maintenance run rate of approximately $20 million a year starting in 2013.
We had a timing issue related to sales of concentrates that resulted in an inventory build for the quarter of approximately 40,000 ounces of gold and 9 million pounds of copper, reducing earnings by approximately $0.05. Going forward, to address this, we will be releasing quarterly production and sales volumes prior to releasing the quarterly financial results. The movements in finished goods inventory, which can be significant, are more visible unless there was surprise when we report earnings.
Operating costs for the second quarter were $5 above the high end of the annual guidance range at $681 an ounce or $30 above the midpoint of the range. This $30 delta above the midpoint reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share. For the full year, we maintained our original outlook of $625 to $675 an ounce despite narrowing the expected production range to 5 to 5.1 million ounces due to the operating challenges at the Tanami. I suspect we will end up slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range for we still have 2 quarters to go. $18 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on copper provisional pricing reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. And finally, the quarterly tax rate was at the top end of the previous guidance range. The delta above the midpoint of the previous range to where we ended up for the quarter reduced earnings by 1/3 or $0.02 a share. We have narrowed the tax rate outlook for 2012 to 30% to 32% while continuing to work on a number of tax planning opportunities for the second half of the year.
So clearly, a lot of noise this quarter, but I remain confident we will deliver what we promised for the full year. This is a long-term business that is volatile by nature, but being public, it's one that gets judged every 90 days.
Slide 7. As noted previously, the operations generally performed in line with budget. Attributable gold production of 1.18 million ounces was, however, marginally below the year-ago quarter. Gold costs applicable to sales of $681 an ounce were up 17% with higher-than-budgeted costs in Boddington, Ahafo, Tanami and Waihi, offset by a strong quarter at Yanacocha, Jundee and KCGM. Copper costs applicable to sales reflect the ongoing Phase 6 waste removal and processing of low-grade  stockpiles at Batu Hijau. Gary will finish the time covering the operating results in more detail shortly.
Turning to Slide 8. As outlined in our dividend release earlier this week, we modified our gold price-linked dividend policy to provide greater visibility and transparency to the realized gold price used to calculate the amount of the dividend. Under the old policy, we linked the dividend to our net realized gold price, which is calculated after treatment and the refining charges and any mark-to-market adjustment on provisional pricing. Going forward, we have linked the dividend to the average London P.M. gold fix for the quarter, which is an independently published number. This will eliminate any bias for us and hopefully provide greater clarity and visibility into the expected dividend, although as noted previously, the actual dividend remains subject to board approval.
Moving to Slide 9. The second quarter average London P.M. gold fix of $1,609 announced translates into $1.40 annualized dividend or $0.35 for the quarter. The dividend is payable on September 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary."

And good morning. Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for his kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call.
I joined Newmont last year because of the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable development, the quality of its people and attractive opportunities for profitable growth and sustainable increases in shareholder value. The company also has a strong commitment to safety, profitability and growth, which are 3 areas that have been priorities for me throughout my career. Since I joined Newmont, I've had the opportunity to visit many of our locations and what I have seen only reinforces my optimism about the company's strengths and opportunities and the quality of our people.
From a financial perspective, Newmont has differentiated itself from industry peers with its financial discipline. The company has a strong balance sheet and has delivered industry-leading per share performance in gold reserves, attributable gold production and operating cash flow. Newmont's gold price-linked dividend is unique in the industry and gives their shareholders direct leverage to gold prices. As Richard said, the board and management team are aligned around Newmont's strategic direction, and we are all focused on executing the plan in driving value for our shareholders.
To be clear, while I'm excited about Newmont's strengths, opportunities and prospects, I am also well aware of the challenges, including rising total costs and increasing political and social pressures, we and others in the industry face, also including political and social pressures in some locations. I've been working closely on these issues with Richard and the rest of the Newmont team and we'll continue to do so as we sharpen our focus on profitable growth.
As Richard mentioned at Investor Day, we have our regional operating teams and corporate teams focused on addressing our total cost. This includes the operating costs, sustaining costs, our G&A costs and our project execution costs. We're leaving no stone unturned. And we'll share this with you as we provide our guidance for 2013.
I'm very excited to be a part of the Newmont team and the opportunities in front of the company. I appreciate the confidence Richard and the board have placed in me. I hope to earn your confidence as well by doing everything I can to create value for you in the years to come.
And now I'd like to recognize the quick-responding colleagues at our Waihi mine. As most of you may have heard last week, we had a truck fire in the Trio underground mine in Waihi in New Zealand which required 28 of our colleagues to take refuge in safety chambers and await rescue. Thankfully, our people acted quickly and all were safely rescued within 7 hours. This incident ended without injury because of the training and the quick and professional response of the team at Waihi.
Turning to Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts were reflected in our costs, with Asia Pacific incurring the largest increase in costs as we experienced nonrecurring mill maintenance cost at Boddington and spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau and Waihi, across a lower production base. As Russell mentioned, our second quarter CAS was higher than the market's expectations. However, costs were within our budget and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 11. In North America, we had a good quarter relative to last year, looking at production. But that said, the second quarter production was down from the first quarter. This is historically Nevada's lowest quarter as we do our annual Mill 6 maintenance. This was performed as scheduled during the April -- late April, early May time frame. We're happy to report also that the ventilation shaft repairs at Leeville are complete and operations are back on track.
We also received positive news at Long Canyon. The notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement was issued for Long Canyon on July 19. This opens the door to a 45-day public comment process. To quote Tom Kerr, our Senior Vice President of North America, ""Engaging the public early will help us to ensure high standards meet community expectations."" We also received our permits, which allow us to continue to expand our exploration efforts around Long Canyon.
Turning to our South America region, on Slide 12. Q2 attributable production of 213,000 ounces was 10% higher than a year ago as we processed higher-grade material and achieved higher recoveries. While we are ahead year-to-date at Yanacocha due to mine sequencing of the higher-grade material in the first half, we expect to finish the year in line with the current production guidance.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Asia Pacific region was impacted by lower tons mined at both Tanami and Waihi. Tanami production was well below plan due to issues related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned stopes. Steps have been taken to address this shortfall, but it will take some time to address. Shaft development is progressing albeit at a slower rate given the backfill issues. At Waihi, we had a shortfall of ore mining in the open pit due to a quarter 1 wall failure and a delay in development work in the underground mine. Both the Tanami and Waihi shortfalls will not be made up in 2012, and we have adjusted our production guidance accordingly.
Our costs were impacted by lower production in Tanami and Waihi, the higher stripping at Batu Hijau as well as the mill maintenance cost I previously mentioned at Boddington, which included tertiary crusher overhauls -- overhaul, major liner replacements and a mill motor replacement as well as the related downtime.
Regarding the divestiture of the last 7% tranche at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court has given notice that it will read its decision next Tuesday on the central government's capability to buy the 7%. This decision should provide clarity on who will be the owner of this 7% stake in PTNNT. The current guidance assumes 48.5% ownership for the remainder of 2012.
On Slide 14, we've summarized second quarter performance of Ahafo in Africa where production of 132,000 ounces was down 9.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower throughput and grade. Cost was $583 per ounce, up from a year ago due to lower production and the higher direct mining costs. The Akyem project is currently 53% complete and is tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013.
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

We've all been involved with cost reduction exercises that take cost out but they manage to somehow find them -- their way back into the organization. And the key for us is putting in place the process and the reporting and the mechanism to ensure that the cost we take out stay out, quite frankly. So that's where we're focused a little bit in the short term but significant opportunity above that both on the capital and operating cost side as we look at our first look at 2013. So towards the end of the year, John, we will, as Gary said, share that with you."

Just noticed the strong uptick in the net debt position in the second quarter. You're up about 70% year-on-year to over $4 billion. And I was wondering how we should think about your CapEx prioritization going forward given that, if we do get a change in the gold price because of your dividend policy, we could start to see roughly 1/2 of the incremental change in the gold price be paid out in dividends, and so it looks to me like you're very sensitive to any further changes in net cash cost. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how sacrosanct the current dividend policy is and then, if it is sacrosanct, how would you view prioritizing your CapEx expense and if you could give us an idea of maybe rough numbers what you'd be looking into 2013. Do you think 2012 is really a lumpy year in terms of CapEx and things will smooth off going forward?"

So how sacrosanct is the dividend? Look, we set the dividend policy. And we've been very clear about this since we set it: We set the dividend policy in ways that we think are sustainable over the longer term. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a policy, it would just be a moment. And so it is a policy. And as it suggests, that dividend policy does in fact enforce, and we like this, capital spending and other spending requirements to ensure that we can keep the balance. But remember, when we set this longer term, we didn't incorporate copper cash flows as we set the policy. We set it to make sure that the increments up in gold price were affordable based on our plans. And with respect to lumpy capital spending, we've been, I think, clear that 2012 and '13 on the old Conga plan were the years where we would have the predominance of capital spending with respect to our 6 to 7 million ounce delivery in 2017, with capital tailing off beginning in 2015. So there are 2 lumpy years -- sorry, '14 -- '12 and '13. We still believe that. Although, with Conga deferred, we're now actually generating $300 million of additional cash flow this year, less after-tax. So Jorge, what I would say is we continue to believe in the dividend policy. We continue to watch capital spending, and we will. And we continue to believe that we can balance returns on capital with returns of capital to shareholders to generate true economic value over the short and longer term, and we're going to continue to focus on that. With respect to the net debt position, I'm going to ask Russ to talk about what we've been able to accomplish here to actually ensure that we have a very strong balance sheet and low-cost debt on the balance sheet."

We've spent a fair amount of time with a rating agency discussing that capital profile and the lumpiness thereof. We've also -- as we look at the balance sheet, we have $1 billion-plus in short-term marketable securities that we have been very clear about with the market we consider as cash. So I really look at that as another $1 billion off of your net debt. We will monetize those at some stage. And again, part of the cost reduction exercise is a focus on free cash flow generation. And you should expect us to be focused on that and keep asking your questions around the net debt. We believe that some debt levels for a company of this size is appropriate and we'll continue to evaluate that trade-off. We've said all along investment grade rating is a key fundamental of the company and we intend to preserve it.

So the milestones unfortunately in that area, political, social community I think are milestones which unfortunately we don't get to drive. But what I would say is that the President of Peru and his Prime Minister, we know -- even his new Prime Minister, who we've not had the opportunity to meet yet but hope to soon, will continue to foster a dialogue table, a listening table in some respects, to provide hopeful outcomes for mediation. And I would expect that, that will continue over the next weeks and hopefully in the next month and we'll see if we can get some outcomes of that. To date, that has not happened, but we have been able to continue -- as I said, on almost all days to continue to work on the reservoir construction. And we're hopeful that, that reservoir construction will generate the water that people apparently are more worried about than we believe they should be because that water delivery system, we know, will work and be better than what's there existing and that, as we do that, hopefully we'll earn credibility with the local community, for sure, and hopefully outside of that. And we just want to be mindful that the milestones that are out there are milestones that are, one, achievable and, two, we can drive. Unfortunately, with respect to the regional government and the central government, a lot of what's happening there is more on the political and government side and we just -- we don't know how to help in that other than participate in the dialogue table.

We would expect that, that would continue to be the case in Ghana, which is 50-plus years into democracy. Our agreement, just to be clear, is one which has been approved by Parliament if for -- that covers both Akyem and Ahafo. On the other hand, that agreement is only as good as our continued commitment and the government's continued commitment to stay in dialogue about issues. And under Atta Mills, we had several layers of discussions going on with the government to ensure that changes in law around royalties and taxes were well understood, that those impacts under our current agreement were well understood. That dialogue is going on and, I would suggest, will continue to go on. And I think that it's that positive dialogue that allows us to continue to say that Ghana continues to be one of the best places for us in our future in terms of exploration potential, in terms of the ability to develop projects, in terms of the long-term support and commitment of the government and in terms of really having great people supporting us in the projects.

Before we jump into the quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on the recent announcement regarding Gary Goldberg's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I worked with the board to recruit Gary to Newmont last year, and I recommended this promotion in recognition of the scope of his responsibilities and the substantial contributions he's already made in Newmont. As you know, Gary joined Newmont in December of last year with a 30-year track record of success at Rio Tinto. Throughout his career, Gary has been widely recognized for his achievements in safety, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. He's quickly come up to speed on our business, opportunities and challenges and has proven himself to be an outstanding addition to Newmont's senior leadership team. As a reminder, today Gary is responsible for worldwide operations; projects of safety and loss prevention, security solutions and innovation; and business excellence.
Gary and I have developed an excellent working relationship and I look forward to continuing our work together as we build on our existing foundation of capital discipline, balance sheet strength, profitable operations, extensive exploration and project opportunities in our industry-leading dividend policy. Many of you have already met Gary, some at our recent Investor Day, and going forward, you will have many opportunities to get to know him better.
This week, we also announced the election of Kofi Bucknor to our Board of Directors. Kofi brings significant financial expertise, as well as extensive knowledge of Ghana in Africa.
I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the passing of the Ghanaian President John Atta Mills. We appreciated the support from President Mills over the past years and know that he will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country.
Now turning to Slide 3. As we talked about in May at our Investor Day in New York, we reaffirmed our commitment to offer shareholders a combination of profitable growth, disciplined returns, strong exploration potential, balance sheet strength and our industry-leading gold price-linked dividend.
Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results performed in line with our budget. Exploration is on track to cover reserve depletion and exceed 100 million ounces of reserves in 2012. As expected, our second quarter gold production was impacted by annual planned mill maintenance in Nevada, lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia and lower gold and copper production from Batu Hijau in Indonesia as we continue with the planned stripping to Phase 6. While we had a few items in the quarter that impacted our earnings, which Russell with speak to later in the call, we remain generally on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals established at the beginning of this year.
As noted in our earnings release yesterday, we're narrowing our 2012 outlook for attributable gold production to 5 to 5.1 million ounces, while maintaining our outlook for CAS of $625 to $675 per ounce. We've also lowered our 2012 attributable capital expenditure outlook by approximately $300 million, primarily as a result of our slower development timetable at Conga in Peru.
We expect our advanced projects expenditures to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower in 2012, primarily as a result of our deferred development plans in Peru, as well as our refined scopes of work at several of our early-stage projects in Nevada and in our Asia Pacific region. Similarly, we expect our exploration and G&A spending to be lower by approximately $40 million to $50 million this year and 10 to 12 -- $10 million to $20 million in G&A: so $40 million to $50 million for exploration, $10 million in G&A.
We're also mindful to balance our desire for increased efficiency with our continued commitment to build a healthy, more efficient and growing consis – growing business, which is entirely consistent with what we discussed with you at Investor Day. So as a result, our adjusted outlook for advanced projects exploration and G&A spending has been reduced by approximately $100 million for 2012. As we continue to optimize our portfolio of projects and businesses, as we refine our plans and focus on total cost reductions, we do expect to identify further efficiencies and cost savings for 2013. And we will share that with you when we communicate our 2013 expectations.
We also remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return. Earlier this week, we also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average afternoon gold fix of $1,609 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of approximately 3%.
Turning to Slide 4. As many of you know, our project pipeline includes a number of advance-stage development opportunities, such as the Akyem project in Ghana, which Gary will talk about in a bit, as well as some earlier-stage opportunities that we continue to optimize and refine. Our portfolio has the potential to reach 6 to 7 million ounces of attributable gold production over the next 5 years, depending on future events in Peru as well as the results of our ongoing earlier-stage project optimization efforts across each of our regions. We will keep you informed of our progress and evaluation of our earlier-stage projects, including Subika, the Ahafo Mill project, Waihi, Merian and Long Canyon, as well as various regional expansion opportunities.
Turning to Slide 5. Conga is still in our plans, but moving ahead on a very measured basis. We are focused on the construction of additional reservoirs, completing the construction of the camp in engineering and the final procurement of major equipment, while at the same time working closely with the government and the community to build this project in a safe environmentally and socially acceptable manner.
In support of this effort for 2012 and 2013, we have, as we've communicated previously, revised our estimates for capital spending at Conga to $440 million on an attributable basis. Thus far in 2012 we might have spent approximately $185 million in development of water reservoirs, engineering, equipment and camp construction. However, I must continue to caution that ongoing community unrest and protests could further delay advancement of those activities.
Our relationship with the communities in Peru is extremely important to us. We hope to continue working cooperatively with the government of Peru and the local communities, as well as with the regional government, through the mediation and dialogue process to develop a peaceful and amenable solution to the political, social and other issues that have led to protests and community unrest in the areas outside of our immediate area of influence around Conga. We note the recent Peruvian government cabinet changes and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government, with the new Prime Minister and continuing to support President Humala's social inclusion plan with responsible mining playing a key part.
As we've said, further development of the Conga project will occur only with local and national support and only if it can be done in a safe, socially, environmentally responsible manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our second quarter financial and operating results."
291795,210280905,333321,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2012",2012-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard.

Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due to scheduled roster maintenance in Nevada and seasonality issues at a number of our operations. Clearly, this quarter was no exception.
Having said that, from a production and CAS perspective, we're on budget for the first 6 months and we are significantly below budget on capital expenditures, a trend I expect to continue and not just because of the slowdown in Conga.
Reading the sales coverage this morning provided some interesting perspectives on the quarter. I think Stephen Walker at RBC summed it up quite nicely, and I quote, ""Earnings missed not as bad as it looks,"" as did John Bridges at JPMorgan: ""Numerous negative adjustments, but operations looking firm."" I will explain why and provide a little perspective on the quarter's results.
Revenue was down 6% on lower gold and copper volumes and a lower realized copper price, partially offset by a higher gold price. Net income was in line with budget although significantly lower than the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to a $200 million quarter-on-quarter reduction in pretax income at Batu Hijau in Indonesia. We've discussed previously, you shouldn't expect a turnaround at Batu Hijau until we get into Phase 6 ore, currently scheduled for early 2014.
Adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, largely in line with budget, but approximately $0.30 short of the consensus earnings estimate. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes stepping you through 5 items that account for about $0.24 or 3/4 of that shortfall.
We incurred approximately $52 million in care and maintenance costs at Hope Bay as we wind that project down. As you know, we wrote our investment offer at the year end, but in terms of U.S. GAAP, we were not allowed to accrue for all future care and maintenance costs, so we have to expense fees as incurred, going forward. Due to the fact that we have no Canadian-sourced income, we also have to raise the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, so pre- and post-tax numbers on Hope Bay are essentially the same. The resulting impact to earnings of that $52 million was about $0.10 a share. Going forward, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on closure costs at Hope Bay in the second half of the year before entering into a steady-state care and maintenance run rate of approximately $20 million a year starting in 2013.
We had a timing issue related to sales of concentrates that resulted in an inventory build for the quarter of approximately 40,000 ounces of gold and 9 million pounds of copper, reducing earnings by approximately $0.05. Going forward, to address this, we will be releasing quarterly production and sales volumes prior to releasing the quarterly financial results. The movements in finished goods inventory, which can be significant, are more visible and less of a surprise when we report earnings.
Operating costs for the second quarter were $5 above the high end of the annual guidance range at $681 an ounce or $30 above the midpoint of the range. This $30 delta above the midpoint reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share. For the full year, we maintained our original outlook of $625 to $675 an ounce despite narrowing the expected production range to 5 to 5.1 million ounces due to the operating challenges at the Tanami. I suspect we will end up slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range for we still have 2 quarters to go. $18 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on copper provisional pricing reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. And finally, the quarterly tax rate was at the top end of the previous guidance range. The delta above the midpoint of the previous range to where we ended up for the quarter reduced earnings by 1/3 or $0.02 a share. We have narrowed the tax rate outlook for 2012 to 30% to 32% while continuing to work on a number of tax planning opportunities for the second half of the year.
So clearly, a lot of noise this quarter, but I remain confident we will deliver what we promised for the full year. This is a long-term business that is volatile by nature, but being public, it's one that gets judged every 90 days.
Slide 7. As noted previously, the operations generally performed in line with budget. Attributable gold production of 1.18 million ounces was, however, marginally below the year-ago quarter. Gold costs applicable to sales of $681 an ounce were up 17% with higher-than-budgeted costs in Boddington, Ahafo, Tanami and Waihi, offset by a strong quarter at Yanacocha, Jundee and KCGM. Copper costs applicable to sales reflect the ongoing Phase 6 waste removal and processing of low-grade  tockpiles at Batu Hijau. Gary will spend some time covering the operating results in more detail, shortly.
Turning to Slide 8. As outlined in our dividend release earlier this week, we modified our gold price-linked dividend policy to provide greater visibility and transparency to the realized gold price used to calculate the amount of the dividend. Under the old policy, we linked the dividend to our net realized gold price, which is calculated after treatment and refining charges and any mark-to-market adjustments on provisional pricing. Going forward, we have linked the dividend to the average London P.M. gold fix for the quarter, which is an independently published number. This will eliminate any bias for us and hopefully provide greater clarity and visibility into the expected dividend, although as noted previously, the actual dividend remains subject to board approval.
Moving to Slide 9. The second quarter average London P.M. gold fix of $1,609 announced translates into $1.40 annualized dividend or $0.35 for the quarter. The dividend is payable on September 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary."

Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for his kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call.I joined Newmont last year because of the company's re",1123,"Thanks, Russell. And good morning. Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for his kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call.
I joined Newmont last year because of the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable development, the quality of its people and attractive opportunities for profitable growth and sustainable increases in shareholder value. The company also has a strong commitment to safety, profitability and growth, which are 3 areas that have been priorities for me throughout my career. Since I joined Newmont, I've had the opportunity to visit many of our locations and what I have seen only reinforces my optimism about the company's strengths and opportunities and the quality of our people.
From a financial perspective, Newmont has differentiated itself from industry peers with its financial discipline. The company has a strong balance sheet and has delivered industry-leading per share performance in gold reserves, attributable gold production and operating cash flow. Newmont's gold price-linked dividend is unique in the industry and gives their shareholders direct leverage to gold prices. As Richard said, the board and management team are aligned around Newmont's strategic directions, and we are all focused on executing the plan in driving value for our shareholders.
To be clear, while I'm excited about Newmont's strengths, opportunities and prospects, I am also well aware of the challenges, including rising total costs and increasing political and social pressures, we and others in the industry face, also including political and social pressures in some locations. I've been working closely on these issues with Richard and the rest of the Newmont team and we'll continue to do so as we sharpen our focus on profitable growth.
As Richard mentioned at Investor Day, we have our regional operating teams and corporate teams focused on addressing our total cost. This includes operating costs, sustaining costs, our G&A costs and our project execution costs. We're leaving no stone unturned. And we'll share this with you as we provide our guidance for 2013.
I'm very excited to be a part of the Newmont team and the opportunities in front of the company. I appreciate the confidence Richard and the board have placed in me. I hope to earn your confidence as well by doing everything I can to create value for you in the years to come.
And now I'd like to recognize the quick-responding colleagues at our Waihi mine. As most of you may have heard last week, we had a truck fire in the Trio underground mine in Waihi in New Zealand, which required 28 of our colleagues to take refuge in safety chambers and await rescue. Thankfully, our people acted quickly and all were safely rescued within 7 hours. This incident ended without injury because of the training and the quick and professional response of the team at Waihi.
Turning to Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts are reflected in our costs, with Asia Pacific incurring the largest increase in costs as we experienced nonrecurring mill maintenance costs at Boddington and spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau and Waihi, across a lower production base. As Russell mentioned, our second quarter CAS was higher than the market's expectations. However, costs were within our budget and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 11. In North America, we had a good quarter relative to last year, looking at production. That said, the second quarter production was down from the first quarter. This is historically Nevada's lowest quarter as we do our annual Mill 6 maintenance. This was performed as scheduled during the April -- late April, early May time frame. We're happy to report also that the ventilation shaft repairs at Leeville are complete and operations are back on track.
We also received positive news at Long Canyon. The notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement was issued for Long Canyon on July 19. This opens the door to a 45-day public comment process. To quote Tom Kerr, our Senior Vice President of North America, ""Engaging the public early will help us to ensure our high standards meet community expectations."" We also received our permits, which allow us to continue to expand our exploration efforts around Long Canyon.
Turning to our South America region, on Slide 12. Q2 attributable production of 213,000 ounces was 10% higher than a year ago as we processed higher-grade material and achieved higher recoveries. While we are ahead year-to-date at Yanacocha due to mine sequencing of the higher-grade material in the first half, we expect to finish the year in line with the current production guidance.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Asia Pacific region was impacted by lower tons mined at both Tanami and Waihi. Tanami production was well below plan due to issues related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned stopes. Steps have been taken to address this shortfall, but it will take some time to address. Shaft development is progressing, albeit at a slower rate given the backfill issues. At Waihi, we had a shortfall of ore mining in the open pit due to a quarter 1 wall failure and a delay in development work in the underground mine. Both the Tanami and Waihi shortfalls will not be made up in 2012, and we have adjusted our production guidance accordingly.
Our costs were impacted by lower production in Tanami and Waihi, the higher stripping at Batu Hijau, as well as the mill maintenance cost I previously mentioned at Boddington, which included tertiary crusher overhauls -- overhaul, major liner replacements and a mill motor replacement, as well as the related downtime.
Regarding the divestiture of the last 7% tranche at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court has given notice that it will read its decision next Tuesday on the central government's capability to buy the 7%. This decision should provide clarity on who will be the owner of this 7% stake in PTNNT. The current guidance assumes 48.5% ownership for the remainder of 2012.
On Slide 14, we've summarized second quarter performance of Ahafo in Africa where production of 132,000 ounces was down 9.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower throughput and grade. Cost was $583 per ounce, up from a year ago due to lower production and a higher direct mining costs. The Akyem project is currently 53% complete and is tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013.
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

For the future, we remain focused on delivering profitable growth, realizing exploration potential and ensuring competitive project returns on capital. Recognizing that, when things change with respect to potential social, political and other risks, we will incorporate those changes and risks into our project claims and returns and ensure that our projects continue to remain viable. We don't believe that growth in any cost is a winning strategy.
We continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, which affords us the flexibility to be selective on the projects we develop, while continuing to reward our shareholders with one of the best dividends in the industry. We will maintain that strong balance sheet.
And finally, we're focused on reducing our total costs, not just operating costs and not just capital costs, but all of our costs right through the portfolio, from the exploration stage all the way through closure. And we'll do so while ensuring we maintain focus on delivering longer-term value in accordance with the strategy we discussed with you at Investor Day.

We're still in the middle of the budget process for 2013, but it's fair to say, across the entire organization, folks are involved and focused on eliminating total cost. It's too early to give you numbers. We have to work through the steps internally and then with our board, but we will make this public when we announce not only '13 numbers but some indication of the 2014 and beyond run rate, because I think the run rate's probably the most important thing. We've all been involved with cost reduction exercises that take cost out, but they manage to somehow find them -- their way back into the organization. And the key for us is putting in place the process and the reporting and the mechanism to ensure that the cost we take out stay out, quite frankly. So that's where we're focused a little bit in the short term but significant opportunity above that, both on the capital and operating cost side, as we look at our first look at 2013.

And I was wondering how we should think about your CapEx prioritization going forward given that, if we do get a change in the gold price because of your dividend policy, we could start to see roughly 1/2 of the incremental change in the gold price be paid out in dividends, and so it looks to me like you're very sensitive to any further changes in net cash cost. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how sacrosanct the current dividend policy is. And then, if it is sacrosanct, how would you view prioritizing your CapEx expense and if you could give us an idea of maybe rough numbers what you'd be looking into 2013.

So how sacrosanct is the dividend? Look, we set the dividend policy. And we've been very clear about this since we set it: We set the dividend policy in ways that we think are sustainable over the longer term. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a policy, it would just be a moment. And so it is a policy. And as it suggests, that dividend policy does in fact enforce, and we like this, capital spending and other spending requirements to ensure that we can keep the balance. But remember, when we set this longer term, we didn't incorporate copper cash flows as we set the policy. We set it to make sure that the increments up in gold price were affordable based on our plans. And with respect to lumpy capital spending, we've been, I think, clear that 2012 and '13 on the old Conga plan were the years where we would have the predominance of capital spending with respect to our 6 to 7 million ounce delivery in 2017, with capital tailing off beginning in 2015. So there are 2 lumpy years -- sorry, '14 -- '12 and '13. We still believe that. Although, with Conga deferred, we're now actually generating $300 million of additional cash flow this year, less after-tax. So Jorge, what I would say is we continue to believe in the dividend policy. We continue to watch capital spending, and we will. And we continue to believe that we can balance returns on capital with returns of capital to shareholders to generate true economic value over the short and longer term, and we're going to continue to focus on that. With respect to the net debt position, I'm going to ask Russ to talk about what we've been able to accomplish here to actually ensure that we have a very strong balance sheet and low-cost debt on the balance sheet."

We've also -- as we look at the balance sheet, we have $1 billion-plus in short-term marketable securities that we have been very clear about with the market we consider as cash. So I really look at that as another $1 billion off of your net debt. We will monetize those at some stage. And again, part of the cost reduction exercise is a focus on free cash flow generation. And you should expect us to be focused on that and keep asking your questions around the net debt. We believe that some debt levels for a company of this size is appropriate and we'll continue to evaluate that trade-off.

And under Atta Mills, we had several layers of discussions going on with the government to ensure that changes in law around royalties and taxes were well understood, that those impacts under our current agreement were well understood. That dialogue is going on and, I would suggest, will continue to go on. And I think that it's that positive dialogue that allows us to continue to say that Ghana continues to be one of the best places for us in our future in terms of exploration potential, in terms of the ability to develop projects, in terms of the long-term support and commitment of the government and in terms of really having great people supporting us in the projects. So Ghana continues to be not just a shining light for democracy but, I think, a shining light for Newmont.
Okay. So that's the extent of our time today. Really appreciate your listening to our call and attending. And thanks for continued attention as we continue to deliver ongoing performance under our plan."

Before we jump into the quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on the recent announcement regarding Gary Goldberg's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I worked with the board to recruit Gary to Newmont last year, and I recommended this promotion in recognition of the scope of his responsibilities and the substantial contributions he's already made in Newmont. As you know, Gary joined Newmont in December of last year with a 30-year track record of success at Rio Tinto. Throughout his career, Gary has been widely recognized for his achievements in safety, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. He's quickly come up to speed on our business, opportunities and challenges and has proven himself to be an outstanding addition to Newmont's senior leadership team. As a reminder, today Gary is responsible for worldwide operations; projects of safety and loss prevention, security solutions and innovation; and business excellence.
Gary and I have developed an excellent working relationship and I look forward to continuing our work together as we build on our existing foundation of capital discipline, balance sheet strength, profitable operations, extensive exploration and project opportunities in our industry-leading dividend policy. Many of you have already met Gary, some at our recent Investor Day, and going forward, you will have many opportunities to get to know him better.
This week, we also announced the election of Kofi Bucknor to our Board of Directors. Kofi brings significant financial expertise, as well as extensive knowledge of Ghana in Africa.
I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the passing of the Ghanaian President John Atta Mills. We appreciated the support from President Mills over the past years and know that he will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country.
Now turning to Slide 3. As we talked about in May at our Investor Day in New York, we reaffirmed our commitment to offer shareholders a combination of profitable growth, disciplined returns, strong exploration potential, balance sheet strength and our industry-leading gold price-linked dividend.
Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results performed in line with our budget. Exploration is on track to cover reserve depletion and exceed 100 million ounces of reserves in 2012. As expected, our second quarter gold production was impacted by annual planned mill maintenance in Nevada, lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia and lower gold and copper production from Batu Hijau in Indonesia as we continue with the planned stripping to Phase 6. While we had a few items in the quarter that impacted our earnings, which Russell with speak to later in the call, we remain generally on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals established at the beginning of this year.
As noted in our earnings release yesterday, we're narrowing our 2012 outlook for attributable gold production to 5 to 5.1 million ounces, while maintaining our outlook for CAS of $625 to $675 per ounce. We've also lowered our 2012 attributable capital expenditure outlook by approximately $300 million, primarily as a result of our slower development timetable at Conga in Peru.
We expect our advanced projects expenditures to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower in 2012, primarily as a result of our deferred development plans in Peru, as well as our refined scopes of work at several of our early-stage projects in Nevada and in our Asia Pacific region. Similarly, we expect our exploration and G&A spending to be lower by approximately $40 million to $50 million this year and 10 to 12 -- $10 million to $20 million in G&A: so $40 million to $50 million for exploration, $10 million in G&A.
We're also mindful to balance our desire for increased efficiency with our continued commitment to build a healthy, more efficient and growing business, which is entirely consistent with what we discussed with you at Investor Day. So as a result, our adjusted outlook for advanced projects exploration and G&A spending has been reduced by approximately $100 million for 2012. As we continue to optimize our portfolio of projects and businesses, as we refine our plans and focus on total cost reductions, we do expect to identify further efficiencies and cost savings for 2013. And we will share that with you when we communicate our 2013 expectations.
We also remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return. Earlier this week, we also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average afternoon gold fix of $1,609 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of approximately 3%.
Turning to Slide 4. As many of you know, our project pipeline includes a number of advance-stage development opportunities, such as the Akyem project in Ghana, which Gary will talk about in a bit, as well as some earlier-stage opportunities that we continue to optimize and refine. Our portfolio has the potential to reach 6 to 7 million ounces of attributable gold production over the next 5 years, depending on future events in Peru as well as the results of our ongoing earlier-stage project optimization efforts across each of our regions. We will keep you informed of our progress and evaluation of our earlier-stage projects, including Subika, the Ahafo Mill project, Waihi, Merian and Long Canyon, as well as various regional expansion opportunities.
Turning to Slide 5. Conga is still in our plans, but moving ahead on a very measured basis. We are focused on the construction of additional reservoirs, completing the construction of the camp in engineering and the final procurement of major equipment, while at the same time working closely with the government and the community to build this project in a safe environmentally and socially acceptable manner.
In support of this effort for 2012 and 2013, we have, as we've communicated previously, revised our estimates for capital spending at Conga to $440 million on an attributable basis. Thus far in 2012 we might have spent approximately $185 million in development of water reservoirs, engineering, equipment and camp construction. However, I must continue to caution that ongoing community unrest and protests could further delay advancement of those activities.
Our relationship with the communities in Peru is extremely important to us. We hope to continue working cooperatively with the government of Peru and the local communities, as well as with the regional government, through the mediation and dialogue process to develop a peaceful and amenable solution to the political, social and other issues that have led to protests and community unrest in the areas outside of our immediate area of influence around Conga. We note the recent Peruvian government cabinet changes and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government, with the new Prime Minister and continuing to support President Humala's social inclusion plan with responsible mining playing a key part.
As we've said, further development of the Conga project will occur only with local and national support and only if it can be done in a safe, socially, environmentally responsible manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our second quarter financial and operating results."

Good day, everyone.Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers.

Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due to scheduled roster maintenance in Nevada and seasonality issues at a number of our operations. Clearly, this quarter was no exception.
Having said that, from a production and CAS perspective, we're on budget for the first 6 months and we are significantly below budget on capital expenditures, a trend I expect to continue and not just because of the slowdown in Conga.
Reading the sales coverage this morning provided some interesting perspectives on the quarter. I think Stephen Walker at RBC summed it up quite nicely, and I quote, ""Earnings missed not as bad as it looks,"" as did John Bridges at JPMorgan: ""Numerous negative adjustments, but operations looking firm."" I will explain why and provide a little perspective on the quarter's results.
Revenue was down 6% on lower gold and copper volumes and a lower realized copper price, partially offset by a higher gold price. Net income was in line with budget although significantly lower than the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to a $200 million quarter-on-quarter reduction in pretax income at Batu Hijau in Indonesia. We've discussed previously, you shouldn't expect a turnaround at Batu Hijau until we get into Phase 6 ore, currently scheduled for early 2014.
Adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, largely in line with budget, but approximately $0.30 short of the consensus earnings estimate. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes stepping you through 5 items that account for about $0.24 or 3/4 of that shortfall.
We incurred approximately $52 million in care and maintenance costs at Hope Bay as we wind that project down. As you know, we wrote our investment offer at the year end, but in terms of U.S. GAAP, we were not allowed to accrue for all future care and maintenance costs, so we have to expense these as incurred, going forward. Due to the fact that we have no Canadian-sourced income, we also have to raise the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, so pre- and post-tax numbers on Hope Bay are essentially the same. The resulting impact to earnings of that $52 million was about $0.10 a share. Going forward, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on closure costs at Hope Bay in the second half of the year before entering into a steady-state care and maintenance run rate of approximately $20 million a year starting in 2013.
We had a timing issue related to sales of concentrates that resulted in an inventory build for the quarter of approximately 40,000 ounces of gold and 9 million pounds of copper, reducing earnings by approximately $0.05. Going forward, to address this, we will be releasing quarterly production and sales volumes prior to releasing the quarterly financial results. The movements in finished goods inventory, which can be significant, are more visible and less of a surprise when we report earnings.
Operating costs for the second quarter were $5 above the high end of the annual guidance range at $681 an ounce or $30 above the midpoint of the range. This $30 delta above the midpoint reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share. For the full year, we maintained our original outlook of $625 to $675 an ounce despite narrowing the expected production range to 5 to 5.1 million ounces due to the operating challenges at the Tanami. I suspect we will end up slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range for we still have 2 quarters to go. $18 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on copper provisional pricing reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. And finally, the quarterly tax rate was at the top end of the previous guidance range. The delta above the midpoint of the previous range to where we ended up for the quarter reduced earnings by 1/3 or $0.02 a share. We have narrowed the tax rate outlook for 2012 to 30% to 32% while continuing to work on a number of tax planning opportunities for the second half of the year.
So clearly, a lot of noise this quarter, but I remain confident we will deliver what we promised for the full year. This is a long-term business that is volatile by nature, but being public, it's one that gets judged every 90 days.
Slide 7. As noted previously, the operations generally performed in line with budget. Attributable gold production of 1.18 million ounces was, however, marginally below the year-ago quarter. Gold costs applicable to sales of $681 an ounce were up 17% with higher-than-budgeted costs in Boddington, Ahafo, Tanami and Waihi, offset by a strong quarter at Yanacocha, Jundee and KCGM. Copper costs applicable to sales reflect the ongoing Phase 6 waste removal and processing of low-grade stockpiles at Batu Hijau. Gary will spend some time covering the operating results in more detail, shortly.
Turning to Slide 8. As outlined in our dividend release earlier this week, we modified our gold price-linked dividend policy to provide greater visibility and transparency to the realized gold price used to calculate the amount of the dividend. Under the old policy, we linked the dividend to our net realized gold price, which is calculated after treatment and refining charges and any mark-to-market adjustments on provisional pricing. Going forward, we have linked the dividend to the average London P.M. gold fix for the quarter, which is an independently published number. This will eliminate any bias for us and hopefully provide greater clarity and visibility into the expected dividend, although as noted previously, the actual dividend remains subject to board approval.
Moving to Slide 9. The second quarter average London P.M. gold fix of $1,609 announced translates into $1.40 annualized dividend or $0.35 for the quarter. The dividend is payable on September 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary."

Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for his kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call.
I joined Newmont last year because of the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable development, the quality of its people and attractive opportunities for profitable growth and sustainable increases in shareholder value. The company also has a strong commitment to safety, profitability and growth, which are 3 areas that have been priorities for me throughout my career. Since I joined Newmont, I've had the opportunity to visit many of our locations and what I have seen only reinforces my optimism about the company's strengths and opportunities and the quality of our people.
From a financial perspective, Newmont has differentiated itself from industry peers with its financial discipline. The company has a strong balance sheet and has delivered industry-leading per share performance in gold reserves, attributable gold production and operating cash flow. Newmont's gold price-linked dividend is unique in the industry and gives their shareholders direct leverage to gold prices. As Richard said, the board and management team are aligned around Newmont's strategic directions, and we are all focused on executing the plan in driving value for our shareholders.
To be clear, while I'm excited about Newmont's strengths, opportunities and prospects, I am also well aware of the challenges, including rising total costs and increasing political and social pressures, we and others in the industry face, also including political and social pressures in some locations. I've been working closely on these issues with Richard and the rest of the Newmont team and we'll continue to do so as we sharpen our focus on profitable growth.
As Richard mentioned at Investor Day, we have our regional operating teams and corporate teams focused on addressing our total cost. This includes operating costs, sustaining costs, our G&A costs and our project execution costs. We're leaving no stone unturned. And we'll share this with you as we provide our guidance for 2013.
I'm very excited to be a part of the Newmont team and the opportunities in front of the company. I appreciate the confidence Richard and the board have placed in me. I hope to earn your confidence as well by doing everything I can to create value for you in the years to come.
And now I'd like to recognize the quick-responding colleagues at our Waihi mine. As most of you may have heard last week, we had a truck fire in the Trio underground mine in Waihi in New Zealand, which required 28 of our colleagues to take refuge in safety chambers and await rescue. Thankfully, our people acted quickly and all were safely rescued within 7 hours. This incident ended without injury because of the training and the quick and professional response of the team at Waihi.
Turning to Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts are reflected in our costs, with Asia Pacific incurring the largest increase in costs as we experienced nonrecurring mill maintenance costs at Boddington and spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau and Waihi, across a lower production base. As Russell mentioned, our second quarter CAS was higher than the market's expectations. However, costs were within our budget and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 11. In North America, we had a good quarter relative to last year, looking at production. That said, the second quarter production was down from the first quarter. This is historically Nevada's lowest quarter as we do our annual Mill 6 maintenance. This was performed as scheduled during the April -- late April, early May time frame. We're happy to report also that the ventilation shaft repairs at Leeville are complete and operations are back on track.
We also received positive news at Long Canyon. The notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement was issued for Long Canyon on July 19. This opens the door to a 45-day public comment process. To quote Tom Kerr, our Senior Vice President of North America, ""Engaging the public early will help us to ensure our high standards meet community expectations."" We also received our permits, which allow us to continue to expand our exploration efforts around Long Canyon.
Turning to our South America region, on Slide 12. Q2 attributable production of 213,000 ounces was 10% higher than a year ago as we processed higher-grade material and achieved higher recoveries. While we are ahead year-to-date at Yanacocha due to mine sequencing of the higher-grade material in the first half, we expect to finish the year in line with the current production guidance.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Asia Pacific region was impacted by lower tons mined at both Tanami and Waihi. Tanami production was well below plan due to issues related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned stopes. Steps have been taken to address this shortfall, but it will take some time to address. Shaft development is progressing, albeit at a slower rate given the backfill issues. At Waihi, we had a shortfall of ore mining in the open pit due to a quarter 1 wall failure and a delay in development work in the underground mine. Both the Tanami and Waihi shortfalls will not be made up in 2012, and we have adjusted our production guidance accordingly.
Our costs were impacted by lower production in Tanami and Waihi, the higher stripping at Batu Hijau, as well as the mill maintenance cost I previously mentioned at Boddington, which included tertiary crusher overhauls -- overhaul, major liner replacements and a mill motor replacement, as well as the related downtime.
Regarding the divestiture of the last 7% tranche at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court has given notice that it will read its decision next Tuesday on the central government's capability to buy the 7%. This decision should provide clarity on who will be the owner of this 7% stake in PTNNT. The current guidance assumes 48.5% ownership for the remainder of 2012.
On Slide 14, we've summarized second quarter performance of Ahafo in Africa where production of 132,000 ounces was down 9.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower throughput and grade. Cost was $583 per ounce, up from a year ago due to lower production and a higher direct mining costs. The Akyem project is currently 53% complete and is tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013.
I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard."

We have to work through the steps internally and then with our board, but we will make this public when we announce not only '13 numbers but some indication of the 2014 and beyond run rate, because I think the run rate's probably the most important thing. We've all been involved with cost reduction exercises that take cost out, but they manage to somehow find them -- their way back into the organization. And the key for us is putting in place the process and the reporting and the mechanism to ensure that the cost we take out stay out, quite frankly. So that's where we're focused a little bit in the short term but significant opportunity above that, both on the capital and operating cost side, as we look at our first look at 2013. So towards the end of the year, John, we will, as Gary said, share that with you."

Just noticed the strong uptick in the net debt position in the second quarter. You're up about 70% year-on-year to over $4 billion. And I was wondering how we should think about your CapEx prioritization going forward given that, if we do get a change in the gold price because of your dividend policy, we could start to see roughly 1/2 of the incremental change in the gold price be paid out in dividends, and so it looks to me like you're very sensitive to any further changes in net cash cost. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how sacrosanct the current dividend policy is. And then, if it is sacrosanct, how would you view prioritizing your CapEx expense and if you could give us an idea of maybe rough numbers what you'd be looking into 2013. Do you think 2012 is really a lumpy year in terms of CapEx and things will smooth off going forward?"

So how sacrosanct is the dividend? Look, we set the dividend policy. And we've been very clear about this since we set it: We set the dividend policy in ways that we think are sustainable over the longer term. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a policy, it would just be a moment. And so it is a policy. And as it suggests, that dividend policy does in fact enforce, and we like this, capital spending and other spending requirements to ensure that we can keep the balance. But remember, when we set this longer term, we didn't incorporate copper cash flows as we set the policy. We set it to make sure that the increments up in gold price were affordable based on our plans. And with respect to lumpy capital spending, we've been, I think, clear that 2012 and '13 on the old Conga plan were the years where we would have the predominance of capital spending with respect to our 6 to 7 million ounce delivery in 2017, with capital tailing off beginning in 2015. So there are 2 lumpy years -- sorry, '14 -- '12 and '13. We still believe that. Although, with Conga deferred, we're now actually generating $300 million of additional cash flow this year, less after-tax. So Jorge, what I would say is we continue to believe in the dividend policy. We continue to watch capital spending, and we will. And we continue to believe that we can balance returns on capital with returns of capital to shareholders to generate true economic value over the short and longer term, and we're going to continue to focus on that. With respect to the net debt position, I'm going to ask Russ to talk about what we've been able to accomplish here to actually ensure that we have a very strong balance sheet and low-cost debt on the balance sheet."

We've spent a fair amount of time with a rating agency discussing that capital profile and the lumpiness thereof. We've also -- as we look at the balance sheet, we have $1 billion-plus in short-term marketable securities that we have been very clear about with the market we consider as cash. So I really look at that as another $1 billion off of your net debt. We will monetize those at some stage. And again, part of the cost reduction exercise is a focus on free cash flow generation. And you should expect us to be focused on that and keep asking your questions around the net debt. We believe that some debt levels for a company of this size is appropriate and we'll continue to evaluate that trade-off. We've said all along investment grade rating is a key fundamental of the company and we intend to preserve it.

So the milestones unfortunately in that area, political, social, community, I think are milestones which unfortunately we don't get to drive. But what I would say is that the President of Peru and his Prime Minister, we know -- even his new Prime Minister, who we've not had the opportunity to meet yet but hope to soon, will continue to foster a dialogue table, a listening table in some respects, to provide hopeful outcomes for mediation. And I would expect that, that will continue over the next weeks and hopefully in the next month and we'll see if we can get some outcomes of that. To date, that has not happened, but we have been able to continue -- as I said, on almost all days to continue to work on the reservoir construction. And we're hopeful that, that reservoir construction will generate the water that people apparently are more worried about than we believe they should be because that water delivery system, we know, will work and be better than what's there existing and that, as we do that, hopefully we'll earn credibility with the local community, for sure, and hopefully outside of that. And we just want to be mindful that the milestones that are out there are milestones that are, one, achievable and, two, we can drive.

We would expect that, that would continue to be the case in Ghana, which is 50-plus years into democracy. Our agreement, just to be clear, is one which has been approved by Parliament if for -- that covers both Akyem and Ahafo. On the other hand, that agreement is only as good as our continued commitment and the government's continued commitment to stay in dialogue about issues. And under Atta Mills, we had several layers of discussions going on with the government to ensure that changes in law around royalties and taxes were well understood, that those impacts under our current agreement were well understood. That dialogue is going on and, I would suggest, will continue to go on. And I think that it's that positive dialogue that allows us to continue to say that Ghana continues to be one of the best places for us in our future in terms of exploration potential, in terms of the ability to develop projects, in terms of the long-term support and commitment of the government and in terms of really having great people supporting us in the projects.

Q3 was another solid quarter of delivering balanced performance from our operating portfolio. For the quarter, we reported positive results in 2 regions: in Nevada, resulting from higher grades and higher leach tonnage; and Yanacocha, where recoveries and grades were higher than expected. These positives were partially offset, as announced in October with our production and sales results, with from challenges in our APAC region, primarily at the Tanami mining and Boddington in Australia. Gary will discuss our operating results in greater detail  a bit later.
We remain on-track to meet full year production guidance for 2012, although likely at the low end of the 5 million to 5.1 million ounces range. Primarily due to the slightly estimated lower production levels, we also narrowed our CAS outlook range for the year to between $650 and $675 per ounce, and it's likely will end toward the higher end of that range.
We continue to make progress on reducing our total cost, as we spoke with you about in our Investor Day in May. The value enhancement program is designed to identify and eliminate redundancies and efficiencies -- and inefficiencies, sorry, throughout our company to provide increased financial returns. We continue to focus not only on reducing the upward trend in our operating cost, but in all other areas of the business as well. While this focus is not new for us, we have several new and/or growing capabilities in this area. Recent advances in consolidating our existing ERP platforms into one platform will, over time, eliminate some of the current duplication we have in regional and corporate functional overheads.
That consolidation will also allow us to move into shared service environment for many of those factions, providing a highly leverage-able model that will increase how increasing really can afford our operations team. Gary Goldberg, our President and COO, has already brought a renewed effort into more effectively and efficiently delivering the substantial technical capabilities that reside in Newmont, while also demanding stronger technical foundations so that we can deliver more predictable mine planning models and more closely connect those models to expected cash flow from our business models.
In our exploration area, we will continue to target annual reserve additions to offset depletion, spending less than we did in 2011 and improving our returns from that portion of the business. And finally, in our projects area, our value returns group, under Russell Ball and Tom leadership is delivering the capabilities to evaluating our project portfolio, allowing us to cut out earlier projects that don't make economic sense and to more fully evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of those projects where we continue to invest. Russell can talk some more about the progress we're making on reducing cost in a moment.
What's clearly a step in the right direction to reduce our capital spending, G&A exploration advance project costs in 2012, as we're doing, we've acknowledged this as just a start, and we will come out with additional cost savings targets next year.
On to Slide 4. Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average gold fix of $1,652 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of roughly 2.5%. So far this year, we paid out approximately $520 million, which is 62% more than we did for the same period last year. So we are focused on profitable production, disciplined returns and returning capital to shareholders. And from a return on capital standpoint, our gold price-linked dividend provides leverage without the cost of holding physical gold through ETFs. And the payout structure benefit show holders of the price of gold prices, providing additional leverage to gold price without the cost of owning physical gold through ETFs. And we believe that the price of gold can and will go higher, which will lead to a greater payout for our shareholders. And on that note, I'll turn it over to Russell Ball."

Before jumping into the third quarter details, I wanted to step back and take a couple minutes to give you a perspective on the gold market and how our thinking in that regard has shaped our view on the capital",1332,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the third quarter details, I wanted to step back and take a couple minutes to give you a perspective on the gold market and how our thinking in that regard has shaped our view on the capital structure of the company and the later return of capital to shareholders.
In early 2011, when we outlined our growth plan, we know that 2012 and 2013 is going to require significant CapEx, and that with the gold price-linked dividend, debt service obligations and the significantly lower cash flow out of Batu Hijau in 2012 and 2013, we fully expected it to be in a negative free cash flow position for these years. A number of analysts have picked up on this and have commented on the sustainability of the dividend in light of this negative free cash flow in the short term. However, we have to manage this capital-intensive business for the long term. As we look out the beyond 2013, we saw significant free cash flow generation as production ramps up and CapEx decreased even at our conservative $1,500 an ounces gold price assumption. But now moderated growth plans due to the issues in Peru, reduced CapEx, an ongoing focus on total cost-reduction and especially substantially-higher-than-budgeted gold price, we're almost $1 billion ahead with where we expected to be on the free cash flow basis when compared to the 2012 budget.
So in short, the strength of the balance sheet and our ability to sustain the current dividend is a function of the gold price, and we remain bullish for a number of reasons, a couple of which I want to touch on briefly.
The chart on Slide 5 puts the current 10-year old gold bull market in perspective and compares it to the last bull market in the 70s. I will admit that gold run over the past decade is represented by the reduce hash line on the chart has been relatively pedestrian versus the last gold bull market represented by the gray line, especially in the light of the broader macroeconomic challenges that we face in the global economy. A classic bubble this bull is not. We think the gold price has a long way to run, especially if you take this analysis and look at it in real terms instead of nominal prices. Today's spot price of around $1,700 an ounce remains approximately 30% below the inflation-adjusted average, depending on which index you use as a measure of inflation seen in 1980, the peak year of the previous bull market.
Turning to Slide 6. We'll see the impact of just one of the broader macroeconomic factors, namely: the collective monetary policy response to the global financial crisis that commenced in '08. The chart shows the rapid growth in Central Bank balance sheet as a percent of GDP and servile in the left-hand axis with the gold price in gray on the right-hand axis. The major central banks responded to crisis after crisis by providing essentially unlimited liquidity and almost 0 cost in nominal terms or significantly negative rates in real terms. Not surprisingly, we have seen asset prices from housing to farm land to -- and global equities to gold wrapped in the way they have, despite a very challenging global macro environment. That the price of gold, in particular, has responded by tracking global liquidity, shouldn't be a surprise since this is a one currency whose supply is limited and can't be created by electronic funding purposes. For this and a number of other reasons we don't have the time to discuss on this call, but which include inherent the primary supply deficit of 800 tonnes a year, central banks returning net buyers and size, the establishment of the gold ETF market and produces no longer selling forward, we are bullish on gold prices. It's our job as management to do a very good job at delevering this gold price leverage to the bottom line, and we are focused on that.
Shifting to the third quarter and year-to-date operating results on Slide 7. Attributable gold and copper production was down from the prior year quarter, whilst due to the ongoing Phase 6 stripping something in Batu Hijau and ongoing challenges at Tanami. The broader production was also below budget as we did expect to mine high-grade Phase 5 from the bottom of the pits at Batu Hijau this quarter or in April we weren't able to access this material.
We realized $1,659 an ounce with operating cost up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $693 an ounce, resulting in an operating margin of $967 an ounce or approximately $107 lower than the prior year quarter. We'll touch on the increase in operating cost shortly. In regards to copper, you'll see the clear impact of the reduced production from Batu Hijau, CAS more than doubling from the year-ago quarter. The Phase 6 stripping and processing at low-grade stockpiles will continue through the end of 2013.
Moving to the waterfall chart on Slide 8. You'll see 11% increase in operating costs on a per ounce basis made up of the following: approximately $40 an ounce in lower volumes, driven by the low-grade stockpile processing at Batu Hijau, lower mining in Tanami, lower ore grades at Ahafo. Approximately 26 an ounce in higher spending, largely due to higher underground mining and cost in Nevada and Tanami in Australia, a $4 million inventory at Tanami and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington. Gary will provide more color on the regional performance shortly.
And finally, about $8 an ounce due to lower by-product credits. We expect some of this service in the fourth quarter as we delay the mining and processing of some high-grade copper ore at Phoenix and Nevada until we completed the floatation planned expansion.
Turning to Slide 9. Financial results for the quarter included revenue of $2.5 billion; net income from continuing operations of $400 million, about a $0.81 a share; adjusted net income of $426 million or $0.36 a share, some 33% lower than the prior year quarter; and cash flow from continuing operations of $578 million, slightly less than half the prior year for the quarter. I'll provide some additional color on the latter 2.
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation on the non-GAAP adjusted net income of $426 million for the quarter to the GAAP reported net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $367 million. The last one discontinued operations relates to a noncash mark-to-market increase on the accrual crude royalty obligation related to Saint Andrews growth field, driven by higher gold price assumption. The restructuring and other of $20 million represents the after-tax in minority interest shares o severance-related cost, the majority of which were incurred at Yanacocha in Peru. The expected 2012 savings related to the ongoing cost-reduction effort is now expected to be about $120 million, up from $120 million -- up from the $100 million, sorry, we communicated in July. Our focus is now on the cost-reduction efforts related to 2013 and beyond, which we will discuss with you during our year-end earnings call in February.
The $142 million from the year-ago quarter is related to the noncash write-down in Power Resources, a uranium producer acquired through the Frontier acquisition in the first half of 2011.
And finally, on Slide 11, some more detail on quarterly operating cash flow. With the decrease mentioned previously largely attributable to increased tax payments with higher provisional payments in Australia accounting for the vast majority of this increase, along with a small increase in Peru, due to the recently enacted mine taxes that [indiscernible] in 2011. Lower gold and copper volumes as previously discussed, increased operating costs as previously discussed. And finally, about $117 million in working capital increases spread evenly between accounts payable and inventory was tend to be a timing issue. I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the regional operating performance in more detail."

Before I begin discussing the operating results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Allen Campbell, who is fatally injured in our Exodus underground mine in Nevada on August 31. Allen was 49 years old and had worked at Newmont for 24 years. Our hearts and prayers go out to his wife Julie and their 2 children, Levi and Jacob.
We emphasize safety in everything we do at Newmont at all of our operations every day. This is an unfortunate accident that we are learning from, and we are taking the steps to help prevent similar events from happening again. Our goal at Newmont is to create a 0-harm workplace. We are not there yet, but remain committed to that goal everyday.
Now turning to Slide 12. As Richard mentioned, you'll see that the lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts were also reflected in our CAS, with the Australia Pacific region, including the largest increase in CAS year-over-year as we spread higher Phase 6 stripping cost at Batu Hijau across a lower production phase. Our third quarter golds production and CAS were also impacted by unplanned maintenance at Boddington and lower tonnes mined at Tanami in Australia. While our third quarter CAS of $693 per ounce was above the upper end of the 2012 outlook, our year-to-date CAS of $654 per ounce is within the revised range of $650 million to $675 per ounce. As Richard mentioned, we expect to end the year at the high end of that range.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect slightly higher production for North America and Asia Pacific to offset slightly lower production from South America and relatively flat production from Africa. As a result, we plan to end the year at the low end of our 2012 outlook of 5 million to 5.1 million ounces of production. I want to emphasize that this is not an effort to boost quarter 4 at the expense of early 2013 results, rather it reflects where we are today in the various mine plants.
Turning to Slide 13. You'll see that our North American region continues to be a cornerstone for our company and a remarkable story of longevity, contributing approximately 41% of our production in the third quarter. The repairs that took place at the Leeville vent shaft in the second quarter had a slight impact of production and CAS in the third quarter that took a little time to get caught up. But at the end of the quarter, it was back at normal run rates. Q3 CAS also reflected some lower grades at Midas and Nevada, as well as at La Herradura in Mexico. We are pleased to an ounce that our Emigrant mine achieved commercial production in September. This new leach operation is expected to contribute between 80,000 and 90,000 ounces annually to North America's production. We've also been successful in reporting record throughput in Mill 6 for 3 consecutive months, achieving levels exceeding 10,500 tonnes per day. This is the result of a business excellence program were folks looked at alternatives to the grind of the ore feed that allowed them to increase throughput without sacrificing recovery. Our Nevada team deserves a lot of credit for this achievement, and this is a good example of the benefits from combining the technical and business improvement talent on the opportunities in the business.
We continue to have some good exploration and development outcomes in Nevada. For example, construction is on schedule of the Phoenix copper leach projects. And in October, work began on the first freeze ring as we prepared to sink our third vent shaft at Leeville.
We're still visiting good news out of Long Canyon as the exploration team is reporting good drill results, and we continue to expect to declare first NRM when we report our year-end results next February. We're still evaluating various processing options as we continue to improve our knowledge of the ore body.
Turning to our South America region on Slide 14. Q3 attributable production was 196,000 ounces, representing about 16% of our total for the quarter. Production results were higher than a year ago as higher mill throughput and leach pad recoveries partially offset lower leach placement. The higher production and recoveries favorably impacted CAS relative to the prior year quarter. As some of you may have read, as part of our cost-reduction efforts and to align our staffing levels at Yanacocha's mine plant, we are recently engaged in a reduction and force of approximately 800 employees. We're consolidating several of our functions previously located in Lima to support future developments in the region. There are also some leadership changes underway in South America.
Carlos who joined Newmont 20 years ago and has led our business in South America since 2001 has been appointed Senior Vice President for Australia Pacific region effective February 1, 2013. His experience and steady hand in leading our regional operations through a variety of complex business situations, political and social challenges has also earned him the respect of his employees and peers at Newmont. Carlos is transitioning to APAC region as Jeff Hudson, Senior Vice President in Asia Pacific has announced that he will retire in March 2013 after 30 years with Newmont. Jeff has been an outstanding leader in the areas of safety, integrity and driving continuous improvement in our operations in both Asia Pacific and Africa.
Todd White is being promoted to Senior Vice President, South America effective November 5. Todd will be based in Marco with responsibility for our business in Yanacocha and developing strategy to support future development in the region. Todd has been with Newmont for 18 years, most recently leading our global business improvement efforts and led our ESR and operations teams in Peru in the past. Javier Velarde, Associate General Counsel has been appointed as the Interim General Manager for corporate affairs also effective November 5 and reporting to me. Javier will be based in Lima with responsibility for strengthening relationships with the government and community stakeholders. Javier joined Newmont in 2001 and led our legal efforts in the region from 2001 to 2011. Javier's government Relations capabilities and knowledge of Peru's complex political and social landscape will help build the support necessary for Newmont's future developments in the region. Both Todd and Javier will work closely together a we make the changes to reflect and support our evolving needs, while maintaining our strong commitment to operating safely, profitably and creating a foundation for future growth.
Note that our full year outlook for Yanacocha remains unchanged. Thus, we still expect about 685,000 ounces of attributable gold production for 2012. This means that the fourth quarter production at Yanacocha will likely be closer to 100,000 ounces rather than the nearly 200,000-ounce run rate we've see in the first 3 quarters of the year, as this year's mine plant calls for less mill ore and more leach material in the fourth quarter. With respect to Conga, we are moving ahead with the water first approach, constructing reservoirs before building production facilities or beginning mining. At the same time, we're making efforts to enhance our credibility in the urban and rural community in order to contradict to the improvement of social conditions necessary to move forward with the project.
Moving to Slide 15. Our Asia Pacific region, which contributed about 32% of our production this quarter was impacted by the previously mentioned lower tonnes mined at Tanami, lower grades at Batu Hijau as we process stockpiles and a longer-than-expected mill time at Boddington. Continued issues at Tanami are related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned higher-grade stokes. These issues are being partially mitigated through rescheduling mining into new mining areas and ramping up phase back willing to higher levels. I talked about last quarter, these issues will take some time to address. While the team is working through the backfill issues, we have decided to do for further development work on the Tanami shaft project, as we focus on improving the execution and delivery of the existing operation and to better understand the impact of the near surface underground Auron discovery on the overall life of mine plant. This provides flexibility related to the timing of the shaft development. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami shaft project in 2015.
The unplanned mill downtime at Boddington was primarily due to conveyor pulley bearing failures with the primary feed conveyors, and this issue is being addressed. We acknowledge that Boddington will have to operate safely and without interruption this quarter to deliver on its revised production guidance of 725,000 to 750,000 ounces. That said, with the 72,000-ounce a month in October, we are tracking in line with this guidance for the year.
Batu Hijau production was impacted by lower-grade stockpile material, throughput and recovery to the delayed access of higher-grade ores in the bottom of the pit due to a failure. Lower production rate at Batu Hijau were already requested in our production output scheduled to be revised in Q2.
APAC CAS was impacted by lower production levels I just discussed and the higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, as well as waste stripping cost at Batu Hijau.
Just a quick update regarding the divestiture process at Batu Hijau. Our current economic interest is 48.5% and efforts continue to divest the final 7%. The fourth extension of the closing deadline was signed in October, extending the deadline now to January 31, 2013. Our effective economic interest will be 44.56% once the investment is complete. We will keep you informed as we advanced on this revised schedule. We also began negotiations with the unions at Batu Hijau for a new corrective labor bargaining agreement in November. This week, there was a 3-day illegal strike at Batu Hijau involving our haul truck drivers. This action was not sanctioned by the union, and employees returned to work on Thursday. Processing continued uninterrupted during this time. We've committed to continue our dialogue with this group's representative regarding their concerns, and also like to thank our employees who are remaining focus on performing their jobs safely over the last few days whilst this activity has been occurring at the mine.
On Slide 16, we've summarized third quarter performance at Ahafo in Ghana, which contributed about 11% over Q3 production. Ahafo's production of 131,000 ounces in the third quarter was down 10% from last year's quarter due to expected lower ore grade, the higher grade of pencil bit, which contributed significantly to 2011 production is now mined out, but we are seeing encouraging exploration results from Apensu South. Our full year production outlook for the region remains unchanged. CAS was $561 per ounce, up from a year ago due to the lower production, longer hauls and higher labor cost. Africa production is expected to grow over the next few years, primarily through the development of a team, which is progressing very well. With respect to the development of the Tanika underground mine, we've slowed down the development schedule as we work to obtain the necessary permits and to optimize the overall Ahafo water balance and to the most importantly, determine the most economic sequence for the development of the greater Ahafo district.
Looking at Slide 17, the team project is approximately 65% complete, tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013, followed by a 3- to 6-month ramp-up to full production. In terms of the progress made, 11 carbon and leach tank shells have been completed and are shown in the lower right picture. The tanks commenced water filling in early September for hydro testing, which has just recently been completed. The primary pressure is 85% complete, and we continue with the commissioning and testing of the water treatment plant. Akyem is really taking shape. The grading the shelves has both have been an active, and you can see those in the upper right-hand picture. And the high maintenance workshop is nearly complete. If you recall, we shared first mining pictures at Akyem with you back of the Denver roadshow. And I'm happy to report that mining continues at Akyem at slightly ahead of schedule. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Richard."

I guess mix of throughput a little different from some of our peers in the business. We do look at it, and it depends where your are in the mine, so it's very difficult to put one number. But think somewhere around $30 to $50 an ounce from a CAS perspective. And if we just look at Batu Hijau for this quarter, we would've seen Nevada 140 million to 150 million increase in operating cash flow. That would've all be been against higher capital as we move earlier from the income statement or from working capital, up into capital. So at the end of the day, there is no free lunch. And the accounting does create some noise from an income statement perspective. And that's why we tend to focus on the more maybe on the cash flow than the income statement. But the end of the day, it's in the total cost of production. And as we talked about with you all in May, the focus for us is really on total cost of production. So whether it shows up in CAS or deferred stripping or sustaining capital, it gets in the total cost of production. So you're right, there are some noise on the income statement. Think across-the-board it as $30 to $50 an ounce higher and where we would be under an IFRS environment. But that does move depending on the type of ore bodies, and obviously bigger issue for open pits, so $30 and $50. And for this quarter, at Batu Hijau alone, 140-odd million have ended up higher operating cash flow under that reporting."

First, we are, as Russell already said and as we he said in our main Investor Day, we are managing total cost. We already announced already, Jorge, that we're going to take this year along out of our exploration budget, probably $30 million. I think taking that for really half a year and thinking about next year, I think you could anticipate a further reduction in exploration spending. But as I said, our exploration head is really focus on continuing to offset depletion through additional discoveries near mine and then looking still long term for other development properties through greenfield. So we're still going to be in the exploration business, but we're going to be able to do with less money. In particular, eliminating some of our higher cost opportunities, both higher cost for exploration, as well as higher total cost. So I would say we will see a cut back in exploration in 2013 and probably in the order of $50 million to $75 million is depending on whether we end up with a cash flow estimate for the entire business."

And I can tell you each one of our regions is focused on sustaining capital and then bringing it down. So this year, for example, our sustaining capital had been probably in the order of $250 or $225 an ounce depending on where you are in the portfolio. With that, we continue to look at the balance for next year between trying to sustain the productive capacity but also focusing more on returns. I would say it's going to be the capability to reduce sustaining capital some next year. But I know Gary is really trying to tear into this, and I would say when we get to 2013 numbers, Gary will have more detail for you on those areas where we are spending sustaining capital that we feel can be cut in the next few years and where we are going to the digital reinvested the business. On development capital, obviously, when we talk about our dividend and in 2011 Investor Day, we talked about 2 years, 2012 and '13, which we're going to be cash flow negative, as Russell talked about upfront. And a large piece of that was related to capital to actually develop new business. And for this year, for example, we probably won't look at development capital of probably $300 million to $500 million less than where we started the year. And that's really coming from the reductions at Conga, as well as some reductions at Tanami, as Gary mentioned. Tanami now being stripped out, so 2015 for re-evaluation, Conga being further reduced. We're actually, as Russell said, going to be substantially more free cash flow generating than we thought. I think the same is going to happen in 2014, while we continue to look at the portfolio. So while I can't give you precise numbers for '13 and '14, what I can tell you is, I think, less exploration, less overhead, less in advanced projects, as we are able to move project along, I think, with less overheads, as well as cutting those projects that don't make sense. And I think sustaining and development capital are going through continued focused reductions, while at the same time, allowing us to invest, so we are going to finish Akyem next year. It will come into commercial production. I think Ghana does represent a great price for us to invest additional capital, and we will expand our opportunities there. And then as we mentioned in Suriname and other places where we have opportunities, we will put capital to work. So we're not afraid to put capital to work.

We've got the Ahafo 2x plus mill expansion, basically putting in an additional 1 or 2 mills, and we're still getting through accessing what is the right sequence to bring that on. But that looks to be the next most attractive way of expanding our production at Ahafo, so it's really making sure we have the right sequence. But the other piece and I didn't really talk about it is how Ahafo North fits into that, and whether we fit that in and process it through our existing mill facilities or the facilities there at half oh and whether we develop facilities right ear the Ahafo North.

Turning to Slide 2. Before we get into the quarterly results, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.

Thank you for joining us on the call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. Q3 was another solid quarter of delivering balanced performance from our operating portfolio. For the quarter, we reported positive results",690,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. Q3 was another solid quarter of delivering balanced performance from our operating portfolio. For the quarter, we reported positive results in 2 regions: in Nevada, resulting from higher grades and higher leach tonnage; and at Yanacocha, where recoveries and grades were higher than expected. These positives were partially offset, as announced in October with our production and sales results, with some challenges in our APAC region, primarily at the Tanami mine and Boddington in Australia. Gary will discuss our operating results in greater detail a bit later.
We remain on-track to meet full year production guidance for 2012, although likely at the low end of the 5 million to 5.1 million ounce range. Primarily due to the slightly lower estimated production levels, we've also narrowed our CAS outlook range for the year to between $650 and $675 per ounce, and it's likely we'll end up towards the higher end of that range.
We continue to make progress on reducing our total cost, as we spoke with you about at our Investor Day in May. The value enhancement program is designed to identify and eliminate redundancies and efficiencies -- and inefficiencies, sorry, throughout our company to provide increased financial returns. We continue to focus not only on reducing the upward trend in our operating cost, but in all other areas of the business as well. While this focus is not new for us, we have several new and/or growing capabilities in this area. Recent advances in consolidating our existing ERP platforms into one platform will, over time, eliminate some of the current duplication we have in regional and corporate functional overheads.
That consolidation will also allow us to move into a shared service environment for many of those factions, providing a highly leverage-able model that will increase how efficiently we can support our operating team. Gary Goldberg, our President and COO, has already brought a renewed effort into more effectively and efficiently delivering the substantial technical capabilities that reside in Newmont, while also demanding stronger technical foundations so that we can deliver more predictable mine planning models and more closely connect those models to expected cash flow from our business models.
In our exploration area, we will continue to target annual reserve additions to offset depletion while spending less than we did in 2011 and improving our returns from that portion of the business. And finally, in our projects area, our value assurance group, under Russell Ball and Tom McCulley's leadership is delivering new capabilities to evaluating our project portfolio, allowing us to cut out earlier, projects that don't make economic sense and to more fully evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of those projects where we continue to invest. Russell can talk some more about the progress we're making on reducing cost in a moment.
What's clearly a step in the right direction to reduce our capital spending, G&A, exploration and advanced project costs in 2012, as we're doing, we acknowledged this is just a start, and we will come out with additional cost savings targets next year.
Onto Slide 4. Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average P.M. Gold Fix of $1,652 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of roughly 2.5%. So far this year, we paid out approximately $520 million, which is 62% more than we did for the same period last year. So we are focused on profitable production, disciplined returns and returning capital to shareholders. And from a return on capital standpoint, our gold price-linked dividend provides leverage without the cost of holding physical gold or ETFs. And the payout structure benefits shareholders as the price of gold rises, providing us additional leverage to the gold price without the cost of owning physical gold or ETFs. And we believe that the price of gold can and will go higher, which will lead to a greater payout for our shareholders. And on that note, I'll turn it over to Russell Ball."

Before jumping into the third quarter details, I wanted to step back and take a couple minutes to give you a perspective on the gold market and how our thinking in that regard has shaped our view on the capital",1359,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the third quarter details, I wanted to step back and take a couple minutes to give you a perspective on the gold market and how our thinking in that regard has shaped our view on the capital structure of the company and the related return of capital to shareholders.
In early 2011, when we outlined our growth plan, we knew that 2012 and 2013 is going to require significant CapEx, and that with the gold price-linked dividend, debt service obligations and the significantly lower cash flow out of Batu Hijau in 2012 and 2013, we fully expect it to be in a negative free cash flow position for these years. A number of analysts have picked up on this and have commented on the sustainability of the dividend in light of this negative free cash flow in the short term. However, we have to manage this capital-intensive business for the long term. As we looked out the beyond 2013, we saw significant free cash flow generation as production ramps up and CapEx decreased even at our conservative $1,500 an ounce gold price assumption. With now moderated growth plans due to the issues in Peru, reduced CapEx, an ongoing focus on total cost-reduction and a substantially higher than budgeted gold price, we're almost $1 billion ahead of where we expect it to be on a free cash flow basis when compared to the 2012 budget.
So in short, the strength of the balance sheet and our ability to sustain the current dividend is a function of the gold price, and we remain bullish for a number of reasons, a couple of which I want to touch on briefly.
The chart on Slide 5 puts the current 10 year old Gold Bull Market in perspective and compares it to the last Bull Market in the 70s. I would submit that gold's run over the past decade is represented by the red hash line on the chart. It's been relatively pedestrian versus the last Gold Bull Market represented by the gray line, especially in the light of the broader macroeconomic challenges that we face in today's global economy. A classic bubble this Bull is not. We think the gold price has a long way to run, especially if you take this analysis and look at it in real terms instead of nominal prices. Today's spot price of around $1,700 an ounce remains approximately 30% below the inflation-adjusted average, depending on which index you use as a measure of inflation seen in 1980, the peak year of the previous Bull Market.
Turning to Slide 6. We'll see the impact of just one of the broader macroeconomic factors, namely: the collective monetary policy response to the global financial crisis that commenced in '08. The chart shows the rapid growth in Central Bank balance sheet as a percent of GDP interval on the left-hand axis with the gold price in gray on the right-hand axis. The major Central banks responded to crisis after crisis by providing essentially unlimited liquidity and almost 0 cost in nominal terms or significantly negative rates in real terms. Not surprisingly, we have seen asset prices from housing to farm land in Iowa to global equities to gold react in the way they have despite a very challenging global macro environment. That the price of gold, in particular, has responded by tracking global liquidity, shouldn't be a surprise since it is the one currency whose supply is limited and can't be created by electronic printing presses. For this and a number of other reasons we don't have the time to discuss on this call, but which include the inherent primary supply deficit of 1800 tons a year, Central banks returning as net buyers in size, the establishment of the gold ETF market and producers no longer selling forward, we are bullish on gold prices. It's our job as management to do a better job at de-levering this gold price leverage to the bottom line, and we are focused on that.
Shifting to the third quarter and year-to-date operating results on Slide 7. Attributable gold and copper production was down from the prior year quarter, rationally due to the ongoing Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau and ongoing challenges at Tanami. The broader production was also below budget as we did expect to mine high-grade Phase 5 ore from the bottom of the pits at Batu Hijau this quarter. However, due to the wall failure in April, we weren't able to access this material.
We realized $1,659 an ounce with operating cost up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $693 an ounce, resulting in an operating margin of $967 an ounce or approximately $107 lower than the prior year quarter. We'll touch on the increase in operating cost shortly. In regards to copper, you'll see the clear impact of the reduced production from Batu Hijau, CAS more than doubling from the year-ago quarter. The Phase 6 stripping and processing of low-grade stockpiles will continue through the end of 2013.
Moving to the waterfall chart on Slide 8. You'll see an 11% increase in operating costs on a per ounce basis made up of the following: approximately $40 an ounce in lower volumes driven by the low-grade stockpile processing at Batu; lower mining in mill strip with the Tanami; lower ore grades at Ahafo. Approximately $26 an ounce in higher spending, largely due to the higher underground mining and backfill cost at Leeville and Nevada and at Tanami in Australia, a $4 million write down of inventory at Tanami and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington. Gary will provide more color on the regional performance shortly.
And finally, about $8 an ounce due to lower by-product credits. We do expect some of this to reverse in the fourth quarter as we delay the mining and processing of some high-grade copper ore at Phoenix and Nevada until we completed the floatation planned expansion.
Turning to Slide 9. Financial results for the quarter included revenue of $2.5 billion; net income from continuing operations of $400 million, about a $0.81 a share; adjusted net income of $426 million or $0.36 a share, some 33% lower than the prior year quarter; and cash flow from continuing operations of $578 million, slightly less than half the prior year quarter. I'll provide some additional color on the latter 2.
Slide 10 provides the reconciliation on the non-GAAP adjusted net income of $426 million for the quarter to the GAAP reported net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $367 million. The last one, discontinued operations relates to a noncash mark-to-market increase on the accrual -- accrued royalty obligation related to St. Andrew's Goldfields, driven by a higher gold price assumption. The restructuring and other of $20 million represents the after-tax and minority interest share of severance-related cost, the majority of which were incurred at Yanacocha in Peru. The expected 2012 savings related to the ongoing cost-reduction effort is now expected to be about $120 million, up from $120 million -- up from the $100 million, sorry, we communicated in July. Our focus is now on the cost-reduction efforts related to 2013 and beyond, which we will discuss with you during our year-end earnings call in February.
The $142 million from the year-ago quarter is related to the noncash write-down over our investment in Paladin Resources, a uranium producer acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in the first half of 2011.
And finally, on Slide 11, some more detail on quarterly operating cash flow. With the decrease mentioned previously largely attributable to increased tax payments with higher provisional payments in Australia accounting for the vast majority of this increase, along with a small increase in Peru, due to the recently enacted mining taxes that weren't payable in 2011. Lower gold and copper volumes as previously discussed, increased operating costs as previously discussed and finally, about $117 million in working capital increases spread evenly between accounts payable and inventory which tend to be a timing issue. I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the regional operating performance in more detail."
291795,222420263,376826,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Russell, and good morning. Before I begin discussing the operating results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Allen Campbell, who is fatally injured at our Exodus underground mine in Nevada on August 31. Allen was 49 years old",2087,"Thanks, Russell, and good morning. Before I begin discussing the operating results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Allen Campbell, who is fatally injured at our Exodus underground mine in Nevada on August 31. Allen was 49 years old and had worked at Newmont for 24 years. Our hearts and prayers go out to his wife Julie and their 2 children, Levi and Jacob.
We emphasize safety in everything we do at Newmont at all of our operations every day. This was an unfortunate accident that we are learning from and we are taking the steps to help prevent similar events from happening again. Our goal at Newmont is to create a 0-harm workplace. We are not there yet, but remain committed to that goal everyday.
Now turning to Slide 12. As Richard mentioned, you'll see that the lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts were also reflected in our CAS, with the Australia Pacific region, incurring the largest increase in CAS year-over-year as we spread higher Phase 6 stripping cost at Batu Hijau across a lower production phase. Our third quarter golds production and CAS were also impacted by unplanned maintenance at Boddington and lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia. While our third quarter CAS of $693 per ounce was above the upper end of the 2012 outlook, our year-to-date CAS of $664 per ounce is within the revised range of $650 million to $675 per ounce. As Richard mentioned, we expect to end the year at the high end of that range.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect slightly higher production from North America and Asia Pacific to offset slightly lower production from South America and relatively flat production from Africa. As a result, we plan to end the year at the low end of our 2012 outlook of 5 million to 5.1 million ounces of production. I want to emphasize that this is not an effort to boost quarter 4 at the expense of early 2013 results. Rather, it reflects where we are today in the various mine plans.
Turning to Slide 13. You'll see that our North American region continues to be a cornerstone for our company and a remarkable story of longevity, contributing approximately 41% of our production in the third quarter. The repairs that took place at the Leeville vent shaft in the second quarter had a slight impact to production and CAS in the third quarter as it took a little time to get caught up but at the end of the quarter, it was back at normal run rates. Q3 CAS also reflected some lower grades at Midas in Nevada, as well as at La Herradura in Mexico. We are pleased to an ounce that our Emigrant mine achieved commercial production in September. This new leach operation is expected to contribute between 80,000 and 90,000 ounces annually to North America's production. We've also been successful in reporting record throughput in Mill 6 for 3 consecutive months, achieving levels exceeding 10,500 tons per day. This was the result of a business excellence program where folks looked at alternatives to the grind of the ore feed that allowed them to increase throughput without sacrificing recovery. Our Nevada team deserves a lot of credit for this achievement and this is a good example of the benefits from combining the technical and business improvement talent on the opportunities in the business.
We continue to have some good exploration and development outcomes in Nevada. For example, construction is on schedule at the Phoenix copper leach projects and in October, work began on the first freeze ring as we prepared to sink our third vent shaft at Leeville.
We're still receiving good news out of Long Canyon as the exploration team is reporting good drill results, and we continue to expect to declare first NRM when we report our year-end results next February. We are still evaluating various processing options as we continue to improve our knowledge of the ore body.
Turning to our South America region on Slide 14. Q3 attributable production was 196,000 ounces, representing about 16% of our total for the quarter. Production results were higher than a year ago as higher mill throughput and leach pad recoveries partially offset lower leach placement. The higher production and recoveries favorably impacted CAS relative to the prior year quarter. As some of you may have read, as part of our cost-reduction efforts and to align our staffing levels at Yanacocha's mine plan, we are recently engaged in a reduction in force of approximately 800 employees. We're consolidating several of our functions previously located in Lima to Cajamarca to support future development in the region. There are also some leadership changes underway in South America.
Carlos Santa Cruz, who joined Newmont 20 years ago and has led our business in South America since 2001 has been appointed Senior Vice President for Australia Pacific region effective February 1, 2013. His experience and steady hand in leading our regional operations through a variety of complex business situations, political and social challenges has also earned him the respect of his employees and peers at Newmont. Carlos is transitioning to our APAC region as Jeff Huspeni, Senior Vice President in Asia Pacific has announced that he will retire in March 2013 after 30 years with Newmont. Jeff has been an outstanding leader in the areas of safety, integrity and driving continuous improvement in our operations in both Asia Pacific and Africa.
Todd White is being promoted to Senior Vice President, South America effective November 5. Todd will be based in Cajamarca with responsibility for our business in Yanacocha and developing strategy to support future development in the region. Todd has been with Newmont for 18 years, most recently leading our global business improvement efforts and led our ESR and operations teams in Peru in the past. Javier Velarde, Associate General Counsel has been appointed as the Interim General Manager for Corporate Affairs also effective November 5 and reporting to me. Javier will be based in Lima with the responsibility for strengthening relationships with the government and community stakeholders. Javier joined Newmont in 2001 and led our legal efforts in the region from 2001 to 2011. Javier's government relations capabilities and knowledge of Peru's complex political and social landscape will help build the support necessary for Newmont's future developments in the region. Both Todd and Javier will work closely together as we make the changes to reflect and support our evolving needs, while maintaining our strong commitment to operating safely, profitably and creating a foundation for future growth.
Note that our full year outlook for Yanacocha remains unchanged. Thus, we still expect about 685,000 ounces of attributable gold production for 2012. This means that the fourth quarter production at Yanacocha will likely be closer to 100,000 ounces rather than the nearly 200,000-ounce run rate we've see in the first 3 quarters of the year, as this year's mine plan calls for less mill ore and more leach material in the fourth quarter. With respect to Conga, we are moving ahead with the water first approach, constructing reservoirs before building production facilities or beginning mining. At the same time, we're making efforts to enhance our credibility in the urban and rural community in order to contribute to the improvement of social conditions necessary to move forward with the project.
Moving to Slide 15. Our Asia Pacific region, which contributed about 32% of our production this quarter, was impacted by the previously mentioned lower tons mined at Tanami, lower grades at Batu as we process stockpiles and a longer-than-expected mill time at Boddington. Continued issues at Tanami are related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned higher-grade stopes. These issues are being partially mitigated through rescheduling mining into new mining areas and ramping up paced backfilling to higher levels. That is -- I talked about last quarter, these issues will take some time to address. While the team is working through the backfill issues, we have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami shaft project, as we focus on improving the execution and delivery of the existing operation and to better understand the impact of the near-surface, underground Auron discovery on the overall life of mine plan. This provides flexibility related to the timing of the shaft development. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami shaft project in 2015.
The unplanned mill downtime at Boddington was primarily due to conveyor pulley bearing failures with the primary feed conveyors, and this issue is being addressed. We acknowledge that Boddington will have to operate safely and without interruption this quarter to deliver on its revised production guidance of 725,000 to 750,000 ounces. That said, with the 72,000-ounce month in October, we are tracking in line with this guidance for the year.
Batu Hijau production was impacted by processing lower-grade stockpile material, throughput and recovery due to delayed access of higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit due to an April firewall failure. The lower production rate at Batu Hijau were already reflected in our production output scheduled to be revised in Q2.
APAC CAS was impacted by lower production levels I just discussed and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, as well as waste stripping cost at Batu Hijau.
Just a quick update regarding the divestiture process at Batu Hijau. Our current economic interest is 48.5% and efforts continue to divest the final 7%. The fourth extension of the closing deadline was signed in October, extending the deadline now to January 31, 2013. Our effective economic interest will be 44.56% once the divestment is complete. We will keep you informed as we advance on this revised schedule. We also begin negotiations with the unions at Batu Hijau for a new collective labor bargaining agreement in November. This week, there was a 3-day illegal strike at Batu Hijau involving our haulage truck drivers. This action was not sanctioned by their union, and the employees returned to work on Thursday. Processing continued uninterrupted during this time. We've committed to continue our dialogue with this group's representatives regarding their concerns, and also like to thank our employees for remaining focused on performing their jobs safely over the last few days whilst this activity has been occurring at the mine.
On Slide 16, we've summarized third quarter performance at Ahafo in Ghana, which contributed about 11% of our Q3 production. Ahafo's production of 131,000 ounces in the third quarter was down 10% from last year's quarter due to expected lower ore grade, the higher grade Apensu pit, which contributed significantly to 2011 production is now mined out, but we are seeing encouraging exploration results from Apensu South. Our full year production outlook for the region remains unchanged. CAS was $561 per ounce, up from a year ago due to the lower production, longer hauls and higher labor cost. Africa production is expected to grow over the next few years, primarily through the development of a team, which is progressing very well. With respect to the development of the Subika underground mine, we've slowed down the development schedule as we work to obtain the necessary permits and to optimize the overall Ahafo water balance and to most importantly, determine the most economic sequence for the development of the greater Ahafo district.
Looking at Slide 17, the Akyem project is approximately 65% complete, tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013, followed by a 3 to 6-month ramp-up to full production. In terms of the progress made, 11 carbon and leach tank shells have been completed and are shown in the lower right picture. The tanks commenced water filling in early September for hydro testing, which has just recently been completed. The primary pressure is 85% complete, and we continue with the commissioning and testing of the water treatment plant. Akyem is really taking shape. The grinding mill shells, both sag and ball mill have both been erected, and you can see those in the upper right-hand picture, and the mine maintenance workshop is nearly complete. If you recall, we shared first mining pictures at Akyem with you back at the Denver Gold Show and I'm happy to report mining continues at Akyem and is slightly ahead of schedule. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Richard."

John, it's an interesting question, and when we -- we do tend to look at, you're right, we can adopt it first and it makes I guess, us and report a little different to some of our peers in the business. We do look at it, and it depends where your are in the mine, so it's very difficult to put one number. But think somewhere around $30 to $50 an ounce from a CAS perspective. And if we just look at Batu Hijau for this quarter, we would've seen about a $140 million to $150 million increase in operating cash flow. That would have obviously been offset against higher capital as we move it over from the income statement essentially to the -- or from working capital, up into capital. So at the end of the day, there is no free lunch and the accounting does create some noise certainly, from an income statement perspective and that's why we or at least I tend to focus a little bit more maybe on the cash flow than the income statement. But the end of the day, it's in the total cost of production. And as we talked about with you all in May, the focus for us is really on total cost of production. So whether it shows up in CAS or deferred stripping or sustaining capital, it gets in the total cost of production. So you're right, there is some noise on an income statement. Think about it as $30 to $50 an ounce higher than where we would be under an IFRS environment. But that does move depending on the type of ore bodies here and obviously, a bigger issue for open pits. So yes, $30 and $50 and for this quarter at Batu Hijau alone, $140-odd million have ended up higher operating cash flow under that reporting."

We've already heard some of your competitors talk about paring back the maintenance a little bit. So if you could talk about that. Do you feel that your maintenance capital could come down? Your growth CapEx, broad brush, could you give us an idea of what you're generally expecting for 2013? And then your exploration expenses has grown quite a bit in the past few years and I'm wondering if in this environment where you're managing more for cash flow, is exploration a bit more of a discretionary expense right now?"

First, we are, as Russell has already said and as we said in our main Investor Day, we are managing towards total cost. We've already announced, Jorge, that we're going to take this year alone, out of our exploration budget, probably $30 million. I think taking that for really, half a year and thinking about next year, I think you could anticipate a further reduction in exploration spending. But as I said, Grigore is our exploration head. He's really focused on continuing to offset depletion through additional discoveries near mine and then looking still long term for other development properties through greenfield. So we're still going to be in the exploration business but we're going to be able to do it with less money. In particular, eliminating some of our higher cost opportunities, both higher cost for exploration, as well as higher total cost. So I would say we will see a cut back in exploration in 2013 and probably in the order of $50 million to $75 million just depending on where we end up with the cash flow estimates for the entire business.
On sustaining capital, I can put that one over to Gary and Randy in a minute, but it is something that we actually started to focusing on about 2 years ago, when we saw a significant increase in our own estimates of sustaining capital in our business plan. And I can tell you each one of our regions is focused on their sustaining capital and on bringing it down. So this year, for example, our sustaining capital had been probably in the order of $250 or $225 an ounce just depending on where you are in the portfolio. With that, we continue to look at the balance for next year between trying to sustain the productive capacity but also focusing more on returns. I would say that it's going to be the capability to reduce sustaining capital some next year but I know Gary is really trying to tear into this, and I would say when we get to 2013 numbers, Gary will have more detail for you on those areas where we are spending sustaining capital that we feel can be cut in the next few years and where we're going to continue to reinvest in the business. On development capital, obviously, when we talk about our Goldman dividend and in 2011 Investor Day, we talked about 2 years, 2012 and '13, which we're going to be cash flow negative, as Russell talked about upfront and a large piece of that was related to developed to capital to actually, develop new business. And for this year, for example, we probably will look at development capital of probably $300 million to $500 million less than where we started the year. And that's really coming from the reductions at Conga, as well as some reductions at Tanami, as Gary mentioned. Tanami now being slipped out 'til 2015 for a re-evaluation, Conga being further reduced. We're actually, as Russ said, going to be substantially more free cash flow generating than we thought. I think the same is going to happen in 2014, while we continue to look at the portfolio. So while I can't give you precise numbers for '13 and '14, what I can tell you is, I think, less exploration, less overhead, less in advanced projects, as we are able to move projects along, I think, with less overheads, as well as cutting those projects that don't make sense and I think sustaining and development capital are going through continued, focused reductions, while at the same time, allowing us to invest. So we are going to finish Akyem next year. It will come into commercial production. I think Ghana does represent a great place for us to invest additional capital and we will expand our opportunities there. And then as we mentioned in Suriname and other places where we have opportunities, we will put capital to work. So we're not afraid to put capital to work. We're just going to make sure they have the right returns. I don't know, Gary or Randy, do you want to add to that on sustaining capital or any other area?"

And as we develop an underground mine that draws down more of the water reasons and just understanding completely what the effects are in the region and how we're going to process and handle that water is a critical piece in this stage. So those are some things we're working on. More importantly though is how does it fit into the overall regional expansion. We've got the Ahafo 2x plus mill expansion. Basically putting in an additional 1 or 2 sag mills, and we're still going through accessing what's the right sequence to bring that on. But that looks to be like the next most attractive way of expanding our production at Ahafo. So it's really making sure we've got the right sequence. The other piece, and I didn't really talk about it, is how Ahafo North fits into that and whether we fit that in and process it through our existing mill facilities or the facilities there at Ahafo or whether we develop facilities right near the deposit at Ahafo North. So a lot of options that we're looking at, we want to make sure that we've really gone through, done the exercise and work to bring it forward. And then when is the right time to bring Subika underground in? Clearly, higher grade but also higher cost when you go underground.

Thank you for joining us on the call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. Q3 was another solid quarter of delivering balanced performance from our operating portfolio. For the quarter, we reported positive results",691,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. Q3 was another solid quarter of delivering balanced performance from our operating portfolio. For the quarter, we reported positive results in 2 regions: in Nevada, resulting from higher grades and higher leach tonnage; and at Yanacocha, where recoveries and grades were higher than expected. These positives were partially offset, as announced in October with our production and sales results, with some challenges in our APAC region, primarily at the Tanami mine and Boddington in Australia. Gary will discuss our operating results in greater detail a bit later.
We remain on-track to meet full year production guidance for 2012, although likely at the low end of the 5 million to 5.1 million ounce range. Primarily due to the slightly lower estimated production levels, we've also narrowed our CAS outlook range for the year to between $650 and $675 per ounce, and it's likely we'll end up towards the higher end of that range.
We continue to make progress on reducing our total cost, as we spoke with you about at our Investor Day in May. The value enhancement program is designed to identify and eliminate redundancies and efficiencies -- and inefficiencies, sorry, throughout our company to provide increased financial returns. We continue to focus not only on reducing the upward trend in our operating cost, but in all other areas of the business as well. While this focus is not new for us, we have several new and/or growing capabilities in this area. Recent advances in consolidating our existing ERP platforms into one platform will, over time, eliminate some of the current duplication we have in regional and corporate functional overheads.
That consolidation will also allow us to move into a shared service environment for many of those functions, providing a highly leverage-able model that will increase how efficiently we can support our operating team. Gary Goldberg, our President and COO, has already brought a renewed effort into more effectively and efficiently delivering the substantial technical capabilities that reside in Newmont, while also demanding stronger technical foundations so that we can deliver more predictable mine planning models and more closely connect those models to expected cash flow from our business models.
In our exploration area, we will continue to target annual reserve additions to offset depletion while spending less than we did in 2011 and improving our returns from that portion of the business. And finally, in our projects area, our value assurance group, under Russell Ball and Tom McCulley's leadership, is delivering new capabilities to evaluating our project portfolio, allowing us to cut out earlier projects that don't make economic sense, and to more fully evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of those projects where we continue to invest. Russell can talk some more about the progress we're making on reducing costs in a moment.
While it's clearly a step in the right direction to reduce our capital spending, G&A, exploration and advanced project costs in 2012, as we're doing, we acknowledge this is just a start, and we will come out with additional cost savings targets next year.
On to Slide 4. Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average P.M. Gold Fix of $1,652 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of roughly 2.5%. So far this year, we've paid out approximately $520 million, which is 62% more than we did for the same period last year. So we are focused on profitable production, disciplined returns and returning capital to shareholders. And from a return of capital standpoint, our gold price-linked dividend provides leverage without the cost of holding physical gold or ETFs. And the payout structure benefits shareholders as the price of gold rises, providing additional leverage to the gold price without the cost of owning physical gold or ETFs. And we believe that the price of gold can and will go higher, which will lead to a greater payout for our shareholders. And on that note, I'll turn it over to Russell Ball."
291795,222420263,377266,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone.

Before jumping into the third quarter details, I wanted to step back and take a couple minutes to give you our perspective on the gold market and how our thinking in that regard has shaped our view on the capital structure of the company and the related return of capital to shareholders.
In early 2011, when we outlined our growth plan, we knew that 2012 and 2013 going to require significant CapEx, and that with the gold price-linked dividend, debt service obligations and the significantly lower cash flow out of Batu Hijau in 2012 and 2013, we fully expected to be in a negative free cash flow position for these years. A number of analysts have picked up on this and have commented on the sustainability of the dividend in light of this negative free cash flow in the short term. However, we have to manage this capital-intensive business for the long term. As we looked out beyond 2013, we saw significant free cash flow generation as production ramped up and CapEx decreased even at our conservative $1,500 an ounce gold price assumption. With now moderated growth plans due to the issues in Peru, reduced CapEx, an ongoing focus on total cost-reduction and a substantially higher than budgeted gold price, we're almost $1 billion ahead of where we expected to be on a free cash flow basis when compared to the 2012 budget.
So in short, the strength of the balance sheet and our ability to sustain the current dividend is a function of the gold price, and we remain bullish for a number of reasons, a couple of which I want to touch on briefly.
The chart on Slide 5 puts the current 10-year-old gold bull market in perspective and compares it to the last bull market in the '70s. I would submit that gold's run over the past decade, as represented by the red hash line on the chart, has been relatively pedestrian versus the last gold bull market represented by the gray line, especially in light of the broader macroeconomic challenges that we face in today's global economy. A classic bubble this bull is not. We think the gold price has a long way to run, especially if you take this analysis and look at it in real terms instead of nominal prices. Today's spot price of around $1,700 an ounce remains approximately 30% below the inflation-adjusted average, depending on which index you use as a measure of inflation, seen in 1980, the peak year of the previous bull market.
Turning to Slide 6. We'll see the impact of just one of the broader macroeconomic factors, namely the collective monetary policy response to the global financial crisis that commenced in '08. The chart shows the rapid growth in central bank balance sheets as a percent of GDP in purple on the left-hand axis with the gold price in gray on the right-hand axis. The major central banks responded to crisis after crisis by providing essentially unlimited liquidity and almost 0 cost in nominal terms or significantly negative rates in real terms. Not surprisingly, we have seen asset prices from housing to farm land in Iowa to global equities to gold react in the way they have despite a very challenging global macro environment. That the price of gold, in particular, has responded by tracking global liquidity, shouldn't be a surprise since it is the one currency whose supply is limited and can't be created by electronic printing presses. For this and a number of other reasons we don't have the time to discuss on this call, but which include the inherent primary supply deficit of 1,800 tons a year, central banks returning as net buyers in size, the establishment of the gold ETF market and producers no longer selling forward, we are bullish on gold prices. It's our job as management to do a better job at delivering this gold price leverage to the bottom line, and we are focused on that.
Shifting to the third quarter and year-to-date operating results on Slide 7. Attributable gold and copper production was down from the prior year quarter, largely due to the ongoing Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau and ongoing challenges at Tanami. The quarter production was also below budget as we did expect to mine high-grade Phase 5 ore from the bottom of the pits at Batu Hijau this quarter. However, due to the wall failure in April, we weren't able to access this material.
We realized $1,659 an ounce with operating costs up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $693 an ounce, resulting in an operating margin of $967 an ounce or approximately $107 lower than the prior year quarter. We'll touch on the increase in operating costs shortly. In regards to copper, you see the clear impact of the reduced production from Batu Hijau, CAS more than doubling from the year-ago quarter. The Phase 6 stripping and processing of low-grade stockpiles will continue through the end of 2013.
Moving to the waterfall chart on Slide 8. You'll see an 11% increase in operating costs on a per ounce basis made up of the following: Approximately $40 an ounce in lower volumes driven by the low-grade stockpile processing at Batu; lower mining in mill strip with the Tanami; lower ore grades at Ahafo. Approximately $26 an ounce in higher spending, largely due to high underground mining and backfill costs at Leeville in Nevada and at Tanami in Australia, a $4 million write-down of inventory at Tanami and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington. Gary will provide more color on the regional performance shortly.
And finally, about $8 an ounce due to lower by-product credits. We do expect some of this to reverse in the fourth quarter as we delay the mining and processing of some high-grade copper ore at Phoenix and Nevada until we completed the floatation planned expansion.
Turning to Slide 9. Financial results for the quarter included revenue of $2.5 billion; net income from continuing operations of $400 million, about $0.81 a share; adjusted net income of $426 million or $0.86 a share, some 33% lower than the prior year quarter; and cash flow from continuing operations of $578 million, slightly less than half the prior year quarter. I'll provide some additional color on the latter 2.
Slide 10 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted net income of $426 million for the quarter to the GAAP reported net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $367 million. The loss from discontinued operations relates to a noncash mark-to-market increase on the accrual -- accrued royalty obligation related to St. Andrew's Goldfields, driven by a higher gold price assumption. The restructuring and other of $20 million represents the after-tax and minority interest share of severance-related costs, the majority of which were incurred again at Yanacocha in Peru. The expected 2012 savings related to the ongoing cost-reduction effort is now expected to be about $120 million, up from $120 million -- up from the $100 million, sorry, we communicated in July. Our focus is now on the cost-reduction efforts related to 2013 and beyond, which we will discuss with you during our year-end earnings call in February.
The $142 million from the year-ago quarter was related to the noncash write-down of our investment in Paladin Resources, a uranium producer acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in the first half of 2011.
And finally, on Slide 11, some more detail on quarterly operating cash flow. With the decrease mentioned previously largely attributable to increased tax payments with higher provisional payments in Australia accounting for the vast majority of this increase, along with a small increase in Peru, due to the recently enacted mining taxes that weren't payable in 2011. Lower gold and copper volumes, as previously discussed, increased operating costs as previously discussed, and finally, about $117 million in working capital increases spread evenly between accounts payable and inventory, which tend to be a timing issue. I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the regional operating performance in more detail."

Before we begin discussing the operating results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Allen Campbell, who was fatally injured at our Exodus underground mine in Nevada on August 31. Allen was 49 years old and had worked at Newmont for 24 years. Our hearts and prayers go out to his wife, Julie, and their 2 children, Levi and Jacob.

This was an unfortunate accident that we are learning from and we are taking the steps to help prevent similar events from happening again. Our goal at Newmont is to create a 0-harm workplace. We are not there yet, but remain committed to that goal every day.
Now turning to Slide 12. As Richard mentioned, you'll see that the lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts were also reflected in our CAS, with the Australia Pacific region incurring the largest increase in CAS year-over-year as we spread higher Phase 6 stripping costs at Batu Hijau across a lower production base. Our third quarter gold production and CAS were also impacted by unplanned maintenance at Boddington and lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia. While our third quarter CAS of $693 per ounce was above the upper end of the 2012 outlook, our year-to-date CAS of $664 per ounce is within the revised range of $650 million to $675 per ounce. As Richard mentioned, we expect to end the year at the high end of that range.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect slightly higher production from North America and Asia Pacific to offset slightly lower production from South America and relatively flat production from Africa. As a result, we plan to end the year at the low end of our 2012 outlook of 5 million to 5.1 million ounces of production. I want to emphasize that this is not an effort to boost quarter 4 at the expense of early 2013 results. Rather, it reflects where we are today in the various mine plans.
Turning to Slide 13. You'll see that our North American region continues to be a cornerstone for our company and a remarkable story of longevity, contributing approximately 41% of our production in the third quarter. The repairs that took place at the Leeville vent shaft in the second quarter had a slight impact to production and CAS in the third quarter as it took a little time to get caught up but at the end of the quarter, it was back at normal run rates. Q3 CAS also reflected some lower grades at Midas in Nevada, as well as at La Herradura in Mexico. We are pleased to announce that our Emigrant mine achieved commercial production in September. This new leach operation is expected to contribute between 80,000 and 90,000 ounces annually to North America's production. We've also been successful in reporting record throughput in Mill 6 for 3 consecutive months, achieving levels exceeding 10,500 tons per day. This was the result of a business excellence program where folks looked at alternatives to the grind of the ore feed that allowed them to increase throughput without sacrificing recovery. Our Nevada team deserves a lot of credit for this achievement and this is a good example of the benefits from combining the technical and business improvement talent on the opportunities in the business.
We continue to have some good exploration and development outcomes in Nevada. For example, construction is on schedule at the Phoenix copper leach project and in October, work began on the first freeze ring as we prepare to sink our third vent shaft at Leeville.
We're still receiving good news out of Long Canyon as the exploration team is reporting good drill results, and we continue to expect to declare first NRM when we report our year-end results next February. We are still evaluating various processing options as we continue to improve our knowledge of the ore body.
Turning to our South America region on Slide 14. Q3 attributable production was 196,000 ounces, representing about 16% of our total for the quarter. Production results were higher than a year ago as higher mill throughput and leach pad recoveries partially offset lower leach placement. The higher production and recoveries favorably impacted CAS relative to the prior year quarter. As some of you may have read, as part of our cost-reduction efforts and to align our staffing levels with Yanacocha's mine plan, we recently engaged in a reduction in force of approximately 800 employees. We're consolidating several of our functions previously located in Lima to Cajamarca to support future development in the region. There are also some leadership changes under way in South America.
Carlos Santa Cruz, who joined Newmont 20 years ago and has led our business in South America since 2001 has been appointed Senior Vice President for Australia Pacific region effective February 1, 2013. His experience and steady hand in leading our regional operations through a variety of complex business situations, political and social challenges has also earned him the respect of his employees and peers at Newmont. Carlos is transitioning to our APAC region as Jeff Huspeni, Senior Vice President in Asia Pacific, has announced that he will retire in March 2013 after 30 years with Newmont. Jeff has been an outstanding leader in the areas of safety, integrity and driving continuous improvement in our operations in both Asia Pacific and Africa.
Todd White is being promoted to Senior Vice President, South America effective November 5. Todd will be based in Cajamarca with responsibility for our business in Yanacocha and developing strategy to support future development in the region. Todd has been with Newmont for 18 years, most recently leading our global business improvement efforts, and led our ESR and operations teams in Peru in the past. Javier Velarde, Associate General Counsel, has been appointed as the Interim General Manager for Corporate Affairs also effective November 5 and reporting to me. Javier will be based in Lima with the responsibility for strengthening relationships with the government and community stakeholders. Javier joined Newmont in 2001 and led our legal efforts in the region from 2001 to 2011. Javier's government relations capabilities and knowledge of Peru's complex political and social landscape will help build the support necessary for Newmont's future developments in the region. Both Todd and Javier will work closely together as we make the changes to reflect and support our evolving needs, while maintaining our strong commitment to operating safely, profitably and creating a foundation for future growth.
Note that our full year outlook for Yanacocha remains unchanged. Thus, we still expect about 685,000 ounces of attributable gold production for 2012. This means that the fourth quarter production at Yanacocha will likely be closer to 100,000 ounces rather than the nearly 200,000-ounce run rate we've see in the first 3 quarters of the year, as this year's mine plan calls for less mill ore and more leach material in the fourth quarter. With respect to Conga, we are moving ahead with the ""Water First"" approach, constructing reservoirs before building production facilities or beginning mining. At the same time, we're making efforts to enhance our credibility in the urban and rural community in order to contribute to the improvement of social conditions necessary to move forward with the project.
Moving to Slide 15. Our Asia Pacific region, which contributed about 32% of our production this quarter, was impacted by the previously mentioned lower tons mined at Tanami, lower grades at Batu as we process stockpiles and a longer-than-expected mill time at Boddington. Continued issues at Tanami are related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned higher-grade stopes. These issues are being partially mitigated through rescheduling mining into new mining areas and ramping up paced backfilling to higher levels. That is -- I talked about last quarter, these issues will take some time to address. While the team is working through the backfill issues, we have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami shaft project, as we focus on improving the execution and delivery at the existing operation and to better understand the impact of the near-surface, underground Auron discovery on the overall life of mine plan. This provides flexibility related to the timing of the shaft development. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami shaft project in 2015.
The unplanned mill downtime at Boddington was primarily due to conveyor pulley bearing failures with the primary feed conveyors, and this issue is being addressed. We acknowledge that Boddington will have to operate safely and without interruption this quarter to deliver on its revised production guidance of 725,000 to 750,000 ounces. That said, with the 72,000-ounce month in October, we are tracking in line with this guidance for the year.
Batu Hijau production was impacted by processing lower-grade stockpile material, throughput and recovery due to delayed access of higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit due to an April high wall failure. The lower production rates at Batu Hijau were already reflected in our production outlook that was revised in Q2.
APAC CAS was impacted by lower production levels I just discussed and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, as well as waste stripping costs at Batu Hijau.
Just a quick update regarding the divestiture process at Batu Hijau. Our current economic interest is 48.5% and efforts continue to divest the final 7%. The fourth extension of the closing deadline was signed in October, extending the deadline now to January 31, 2013. Our effective economic interest will be 44.56% once the divestment is complete. We will keep you informed as we advance on this revised schedule. We also begin negotiations with the unions at Batu Hijau for a new collective labor bargaining agreement in November. This week, there was a 3-day illegal strike at Batu Hijau involving our haulage truck drivers. This action was not sanctioned by their union, and the employees returned to work on Thursday. Processing continued uninterrupted during this time. We've committed to continue our dialogue with this group's representatives regarding their concerns, and also like to thank our employees for remaining focused on performing their jobs safely over the last few days whilst this activity has been occurring at the mine.
On Slide 16, we've summarized third quarter performance at Ahafo in Ghana, which contributed about 11% of our Q3 production. Ahafo's production of 131,000 ounces in the third quarter was down 10% from last year's quarter due to expected lower ore grade. The higher-grade Apensu pit, which contributed significantly to 2011 production, is now mined out, but we are seeing encouraging exploration results from Apensu South. Our full year production outlook for the region remains unchanged. CAS was $561 per ounce, up from a year ago due to the lower production, longer hauls and higher labor costs. Africa production is expected to grow over the next few years, primarily through the development of Akyem, which is progressing very well. With respect to the development of the Subika underground mine, we've slowed down the development schedule as we work to obtain the necessary permits and to optimize the overall Ahafo water balance and to most importantly, determine the most economic sequence for the development of the greater Ahafo district.
Looking at Slide 17, the Akyem project is approximately 65% complete, tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013, followed by a 3- to 6-month ramp-up to full production. In terms of the progress made, 11 carbon and leach tank shells have been completed and are shown in the lower right picture. The tanks commenced water filling in early September for hydro testing, which has just recently been completed. The primary crusher is 85% complete, and we continue with the commissioning and testing of the water treatment plant. Akyem is really taking shape. The grinding mill shells, both sag and ball mill have both been erected, and you can see those in the upper right-hand picture, and the mine maintenance workshop is nearly complete. If you recall, we shared first mining pictures at Akyem with you back at the Denver Gold Show, and I'm happy to report mining continues at Akyem and is slightly ahead of schedule. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Richard."

John, it's an interesting question, and when we -- we do tend to look at, you're right, we can't adopt IFRS and that makes, I guess, us and Freeport a little different to some of our peers in the business. We do look at it, and it depends where you are in the mine, so it's very difficult to put one number. But think somewhere around $30 to $50 an ounce from a CAS perspective. And if we just look at Batu Hijau for this quarter, we would've seen about a $140 million to $150 million increase in operating cash flow. That would have obviously been offset against higher capital as we move it over from the income statement essentially to the -- or from working capital, up into capital. So at the end of the day, there is no free lunch and the accounting does create some noise, certainly from an income statement perspective and that's why we or at least I tend to focus a little bit more maybe on the cash flow than the income statement. But at the end of the day, it's in the total costs of production. And as we talked about with you all in May, the focus for us is really on total cost of production. So whether it shows up in CAS or deferred stripping or sustaining capital, it gets in the total cost of production. So you're right, there is some noise on an income statement. Think about it as $30 to $50 an ounce higher than where we would be under an IFRS environment. But that does move depending on the type of ore bodies here and obviously, a bigger issue for open pits. So yes, $30 and $50 and for this quarter at Batu Hijau alone, $140-odd million have ended up higher operating cash flow under that reporting."

Your growth CapEx, broad brush, could you give us an idea of what you're generally expecting for 2013? And then your exploration expense has grown quite a bit in the past few years and I'm wondering if in this environment where you're managing more for cash flow, is exploration a bit more of a discretionary expense right now?"

First, we are, as Russell has already said and as we said in our May Investor Day, we are managing towards total cost. We've already announced, Jorge, that we're going to take this year alone, out of our exploration budget, probably $30 million. I think taking that for really, half a year and thinking about next year, I think you could anticipate a further reduction in exploration spending. But as I said, Grigore is our exploration head. He's really focused on continuing to offset depletion through additional discoveries near mine and then looking still long term for other development properties through greenfield. So we're still going to be in the exploration business, but we're going to be able to do it with less money. In particular, eliminating some of our higher cost opportunities, both higher cost for exploration, as well as higher total cost. So I would say we will see a cutback in exploration in 2013 and probably in the order of $50 million to $75 million just depending on where we end up with the cash flow estimates for the entire business.
On sustaining capital, I can put that one over to Gary and Randy in a minute, but it is something that we actually started focusing on about 2 years ago, when we saw a significant increase in our own estimates of sustaining capital in our business plan. And I can tell you each one of our regions is focused on their sustaining capital and on bringing it down. So this year, for example, our sustaining capital has been probably in the order of $250 or $225 an ounce just depending on where you are in the portfolio. With that, we continue to look at the balance for next year between wanting to sustain the productive capacity but also focusing more on returns. I would say there's going to be the capability to reduce sustaining capital some next year but I know Gary is really trying to tear into this, and I would say when we get to 2013 numbers, Gary will have more detail for you on those areas where we are spending sustaining capital that we feel can be cut in the next few years and where we're going to continue to reinvest in the business. On development capital, obviously, when we talk about our gold-linked dividend and in 2011 Investor Day, we talked about 2 years, 2012 and '13, which were going to be cash flow negative, as Russell talked about upfront, and a large piece of that was related to develop to capital to actually, develop new business. And for this year, for example, we probably will look at development capital of probably $300 million to $500 million less than where we started the year. And that's really coming from the reductions at Conga, as well as some reductions at Tanami, as Gary mentioned. Tanami now being slipped out 'til 2015 for a re-evaluation, Conga being further reduced. We're actually, as Russ said, going to be substantially more free cash flow generating than we thought. I think the same is going to happen in 2014, while we continue to look at the portfolio. So while I can't give you precise numbers for '13 and '14, what I can tell you is, I think, less exploration, less overhead, less in advanced projects, as we are able to move projects along, I think, with less overhead, as well as cutting those projects that don't make sense and I think sustaining and development capital are going through a continued, focused reductions, while at the same time, allowing us to invest. So we are going to finish Akyem next year. It will come into commercial production. I think Ghana does represent a great place for us to invest additional capital and we will expand our opportunities there. And then as we mentioned in Suriname and other places where we have opportunities, we will put capital to work. So we're not afraid to put capital to work. We just want to make sure it has the right returns. I don't know, Gary or Randy, do you want to add to that on sustaining capital or any other area?"

One is making sure we get the appropriate exploration permits. That hasn't been an issue, we've got those permits now, but also understanding the water balance. And as we develop an underground mine that draws down more of the water resource and just understanding completely what the effects are in the region and how we're going to process and handle that water is a critical piece in this stage. So those are some things we're working on. More importantly though is how does it fit into the overall regional expansion. We've got the Ahafo 2x plus mill expansion. Basically putting in an additional 1 or 2 sag mills. We're still going through accessing what's the right sequence to bring that on. But that looks to be like the next most attractive way of expanding our production at Ahafo. So it's really making sure we've got the right sequence. The other piece, and I didn't really talk about it, is how Ahafo North fits into that and whether we fit that in and process it through our existing mill facilities or the facilities there at Ahafo or whether we develop facilities right near the deposit at Ahafo North. So a lot of options that we're looking at, we want to make sure that we've really gone through, done the exercise and work to bring it forward. And then when is the right time to bring Subika underground in? Clearly, higher grade but also higher cost when you go underground. So we want to make sure we get the balance right as we bring that into the portfolio."

We have not seen this slowdown impact, for example, commodity spend yet. And I say yet and there is a big question mark, whether it's on China or on Europe, what the global macro picture is going to be. But our biggest commodity cost outside of labor is diesel fuel. We'll spend about $700 million a year on diesel and you can see that picture pretty readily. The labor component for us is around 50%, depending on which region you're in. And I'll say that the pressure is still upward, and maybe at slightly lower rates than we have seen over the last 4, 5 years. I don't believe that you'll see labor rates stay flat or come down, quite frankly, in this environment. So I think our planning assumption across the portfolio is around 5% to 7%.
