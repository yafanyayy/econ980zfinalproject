Now let's discuss the fourth quarter. Global revenues for the fourth quarter were $973 million, up 14% from 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.30, up 78% from the $0.17 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. Cash flow from operations was $96 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million during the quarter. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.14 during the quarter at a cost of $20 million. We also repurchased 300,000 RHI shares for a total of $7.5 million. There remain approximately 6.1 million shares under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
Our specialized Staffing divisions and Protiviti reported solid results in the fourth quarter, this does mark the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the company. Additionally, growth rates and net income and earnings per share have significantly exceeded revenue growth rates during this period. This reflects the ongoing strong demand for skilled talent, particularly in the technology and accounting sectors. Keith Waddell will now provide you with a closer look at our fourth quarter results."

Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 72 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's International operations represent 26% of total Protiviti revenues. 
Now let's look at gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $282 million or 35.8% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010, and 35.5% of revenues in the third quarter of 2011. The fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 included workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits of $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. 
Temp-to-higher conversions declined slightly during the quarter, while pay bills spreads continued to expand. Our staffing gross margin was $357 million in the fourth quarter, or 41.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.7% of revenues in the fourth quarter a year ago, and 41.4% of revenues in the third quarter of 2011.

Protiviti operating income was $2 million in the fourth quarter or 2.2% of revenues. 
Our fourth quarter 2011 income tax rate was 40.9% comparing to 38.8% in the third quarter of this year. The resulting $1.5 million negative impact was due primarily to lower utilization of foreign tax credits. Accounts receivable were $493 million at the end of the fourth quarter, implied days outstanding or DSO are 46.1 days, which compares to 45.2 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010.

On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in October, down in November, and down again in December. For the first 2 weeks of January, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 17% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. We caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate revenue trends over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these factors, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues, $960 million to $1,010,000,000; income per share, $0.25 to $0.30. It's our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter, our estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We finished the year strongly with double-digit revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis. We were pleased to see continued strength in Technology Staffing during the quarter, as well as year-over-year and sequential revenue gains in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions. As we end 1 year and begin a new one, it's time to reflect not only where we've been in the past 12 months, but also what we believe are our business opportunities ahead. We do feel the company's well positioned for several reasons. The unemployment rate among college degrees is half that of the overall U.S. rates, which underscores the demand for professional level talent. Unemployment rate also is lower in the occupations of which we specialize. Unemployment rate for web developers for example is 3.6% and for accountants and auditors, it's 4.9%. All of this is contributed to a stronger pricing environment across. The U.S. economy added more than $1.6 million jobs last year, 400,000 more than a year before. There's been an increase in hiring by small and midsized businesses which make up the largest percentage of our client base, as you know, this was reflected in the strong performance of our Permanent Placement division through the year 2011. 
We believe the revenue growth in our Temporary and Consulting divisions has been partly the result of more companies using variable cost labor as a component of their overall human resources strategy. In the coming years, we hope to see even wider adoption by employers of flexible staffing models including the use of temporary and project professionals. Our headcount investments last year are benefiting us most notably our Information Technology staffing division. We are optimistic about the possibilities within this technology sector. We also were encouraged by the growth potential of accounting and finance segment where we have a long been the recognized leader. We're also pleased to see higher demand for Protiviti, Consulting and Internal Audit Services in 2011, particularly in the United States. Demand was strongest for Information Technology related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry. 
Our blended service model of combined skilled and professionals from our Staffing divisions with the consulting expertise of Protiviti is creating of the business opportunities for us. We're delivering a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at what we believe is a very competitive price. We have a solid leadership in our staffing operations and Protiviti. And I am confident in their ability as we head into 2012. 
Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We had positive operating cash flow of $256 million in 2011, which helped us to fund approximately $142 million in RHI stock repurchases, $57 million in capital expenditures, and the payment of $80 million in dividends to stockholders. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. Please limit yourselves as customary to 1 question and a single follow-up. If time permits, we'll certainly return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

So that was the biggest divergence. That said, frankly, coming out of the gate the first 3 weeks of this year, Europe firm has been solid.

First of all, currency, understand at the income line, earnings per share line, currency has a very, very little impacted. The only reason we gave currency adjusted",832,"Okay, so let's talk guidance, generally, let's talk currency and then let's talk tax rate. First of all, currency, understand at the income line, earnings per share line, currency has a very, very little impacted. The only reason we gave currency adjusted figures is so that you can better understand the revenue trends. Particularly, when you put the kind of swings that we've had the last few quarters. At the income line, currencies noise, at the revenue line, it helps you understand trends. Tax rate, one of the biggest differences between our expectations and what actually happened in Q4. We expected our tax rate to come down in Q4, it actually went up. That's related primarily to, we made last year in Europe than we expected and we had unused tax credits. We have expected to use that didn't get used. As far as the guidance, our thinking is that the tax rate will be down a little bit again, but to be prudent, maybe you model at the same. So we had a 41% rate in the fourth quarter. Frankly, we expected to be down again in the first quarter and part because their are structuring ways for us to get those credits that we didn't get in the fourth quarter. So call it 40% to 41% with a little it might actually be a little lower. But again, biggest difference between guidance and actual for the fourth quarter actually was the tax rate. And now talking about guidance generally. So if you look at the high-end of our range on the temp side, we're pretty much assuming that the growth rates we saw on the same day basis continuing to the first quarter, we obviously have 3 more days which helped the absolute numbers. On the Perm side, we built in a little more conservatism into the first quarter than was the case -- than what we actually reported in the fourth quarter. That said, as we have talked about, we had a pretty good start to the year. Perm order flow is still good even outside the U.S. The cell cycle the does continue to get a bit longer. It's a bit unusual in that on the one hand, clients are getting more selective, they want to see more candidates. And at the same time, candidates are getting more selective, they're getting multiple offers, they're getting a counter from their employer. It's a bit unusual that at the same time, you get clients and candidates getting more selective. Usually it's one or the other. Depending on where you are under cycle. Fairly Perm is stronger in the U.S. than it is non-U.S. But we did grow non-U.S. 19% year-over-year which isn't chopped liver. Germany is obviously the strongest followed by France and Belgium. Clearly the most challenges the U.K. Australia is what our people call up 2 speed economy, you got mining and minerals, that's doing really well. You've got the rest of that's not doing so well. And our growth rates in Australia have been impacted as well. So back to guidance generally, we are more conservative in our Perm forecasted growth in the first quarter than we were -- we reported actually in the fourth quarter. If you then look at gross margin. We won't have a the 30 basis points lift from the workers comp credits that we had in the fourth quarter. So that will be a headwind in the first quarter. Further, we expect state unemployment rates to rise by about 20 basis points. We'll pass some of that through but not all of that through. But net, we expect our temp gross margin to decline sequentially for the absence of the workers comp and a higher, as the SG&A line we are considering that on the headcount side, Perm is going to be about flat or actually going to adjust the heads downward outside the U.S., and we're actually going to ramp up the technology permanent placement headcount in the U.S. to that extent. So it will be a push and be about the same. Temp, we continue to plan low single-digit additions to headcount. You'll get leverage from the 3 more days of revenue which will help SG&A to get down to the operating line. Temp would be down a little bit because of gross margins down the way I just described. Perm would be in the same rate depending on how Perm revenues perform. Protiviti, sequentially Protiviti, it's tough this quarter as the first quarter revenues are typically down 10% to 15%. We lost a little money a year ago in the first quarter while we're going to try not to this quarter, I think it would be prudent to forecast a loss of $1 million or $2 million as well in Protiviti. So that kind of defines the high end of the guidance. We've been back of virtually all of those assumptions to get to the low-end of our guidance."

Now let's look at gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $282 million or 35.8% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010, and 35.5% of revenues in the third quarter of 2011. The fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 included workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits of $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. 
Temp-to-higher conversions declined slightly during the quarter, while pay bill spreads continued to expand. Our staffing gross margin was $357 million in the fourth quarter, or 41.3% of staffing revenues.

Our fourth quarter 2011 income tax rate was 40.9% comparing to 38.8% in the third quarter of this year. The resulting $1.5 million negative impact was due primarily to lower utilization of foreign tax credits. Accounts receivable were $493 million at the end of the fourth quarter, implied days outstanding or DSO are 46.1 days, which compares to 45.2 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010.

On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in October, up in November and up again in December. On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in October, down in November, and down again in December. For the first 2 weeks of January, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 17% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. We caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate revenue trends over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these factors, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues, $960 million to $1,010,000,000; income per share, $0.25 to $0.30. It's our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter, all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We finished the year strongly with double-digit revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis. We were pleased to see continued strength in Technology Staffing during the quarter, as well as year-over-year and sequential revenue gains in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions. As we end 1 year and begin a new one, it's time to reflect not only where we've been in the past 12 months, but also what we believe are business opportunities ahead. We do feel the company is well positioned for several reasons. The unemployment rate among college-degreed workers is half that of the overall U.S. rate, which underscores the demand for professional level talent. Unemployment rate also is low in many of the occupations in which we specialize. Unemployment rate for web developers, for example, is 3.6% and for accountants and auditors, it is 4.9%. All of this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment for us. The U.S. economy added more than 1.6 million jobs last year, 400,000 more than the year before. There's been an increase in hiring by small and midsized businesses which make up the largest percentage of our client base, as you know. This was reflected in the strong performance of our Permanent Placement division through the year 2011. 
We believe the revenue growth in our Temporary and Consulting divisions has been partly the result of more companies using variable cost labor as a component of their overall human resources strategy. In the coming years, we hope to see even wider adoption by employers of flexible staffing models including the use of temporary and project professionals. Our headcount investments last year are benefiting us most notably in our Information Technology staffing division. We are optimistic about the possibilities within this technology sector. We also were encouraged by the growth potential of accounting and finance segment where we have a long been the recognized leader. We were also pleased to see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services in 2011, particularly in the United States. Demand was strongest for Information Technology related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry. 
Our blended service model of combined skilled interim professionals from our Staffing divisions with the consulting expertise of Protiviti is creating a good business opportunity for us. We are delivering a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at what we believe is a very competitive price. We have solid leadership in our staffing operations in Protiviti. And I am confident in their abilities as we head into 2012. 
Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We have positive operating cash flow of $256 million in 2011, which helped us to fund approximately $142 million in RHI stock repurchases, $57 million in capital expenditures, and the payment of $80 million in dividends to stockholders. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. Please limit yourselves as customary to 1 question and a single follow-up. If time permits, we'll certainly return to you later in the call, if you have additional questions. Thank you."

First of all, currency, understand at the income line, at the earnings per share line, currency has very, very little impact. The only reason we gave currency adjusted figures is so you could better understand the revenue trends. Particularly, when you've got the kind of swings that we've had the last few quarters. Well at the income line, currency is noise, at the revenue line, it helps you understand trends. Tax rate, one of the biggest differences between our expectations and what actually happened in Q4. We expected our tax rate to come down in Q4, it actually went up. That's related primarily to -- we made less money in Europe than we expected, and we had unused tax credits we had expected to use that didn't get used. As far as the guidance, our thinking is that the tax rate will be down a little bit again, but to be prudent, maybe you model it the same. So we had a 41% rate in the fourth quarter. Frankly, we expected to be down again in the first quarter and part because their are structuring ways for us to get those credits that we didn't get in the fourth quarter. So call it 40% to 41%, with a little luck it might actually be a little lower. But again, biggest difference between guidance and actual for the fourth quarter actually was the tax rate. And now talking about guidance generally. So if you look at the high-end of our range on the temp side, we're pretty much assuming that the growth rates we saw on a same day basis, continuing to the first quarter, we obviously have 3 more days which helped the absolute numbers. On the Perm side, we built in a little more conservatism into the first quarter than was the case -- than what we actually reported in the fourth quarter. That said, as I've talked about, we've had a pretty good start to the year. Perm order flow is still good even outside the U.S. The cell cycle the does continue to get a bit longer. It's a bit unusual in that on the one hand, clients are getting more selective, they want to see more candidates. And at the same time, candidates are getting more selective, they're getting multiple offers, they're getting a counter from their employer. Though it's a bit unusual that at the same time, you've got clients and candidates getting more selective. Usually it's one or the other. Depending on where you in the cycle. Currently, Perm is stronger in the U.S. than it is non-U.S. But we did grow non-U.S. 19% year-over-year which isn't chopped liver. Germany is obviously the strongest, followed by France and then Belgium. Clearly the most challenges the U.K. Australia is what our people call a 2 speed economy, you've got mining and minerals, that's doing really well. You've got the rest of that's not doing so well. And our growth rates in Australia have been impacted as well. So back to guidance generally, we are more conservative in our Perm forecasted growth in the first quarter than we were -- we reported actually in the fourth quarter. If you then look at gross margin. We won't have a the 30 basis point lift from the workers comp credits that we had in the fourth quarter. So that will be a headwind in the first quarter. Further, we expect state unemployment rates to rise by about 20 basis points. We'll pass some of that through, but not all of that through. But net, we expect our temp gross margin to decline sequentially for the absence of the workers' comp and the higher suey [ph]. At the SG&A line, we're considering that on the headcount side, Perm is going to be about flat or actually going to adjust the heads downward outside the U.S., and we're actually going to ramp up the technology permanent placement headcount in the U.S. to that extent. So it will be a push and be about the same. Temp, we continue to plan low single-digit additions to headcount. You'll get leverage from the 3 more days of revenue which will help SG&A to get down to the operating line. Temp would be down a little bit because gross margin's down the way I just described. Perm would be in the same range depending on how Perm revenues perform. Protiviti, sequentially Protiviti, it's tough this quarter as the first quarter revenues are typically down 10% to 15%. We lost a little money a year ago in the first quarter while we're going to try not to this quarter, I think it would be prudent to forecast a loss of $1 million or $2 million as well in Protiviti. So that kind of defines the high end of the guidance. We've then back off of virtually all of those assumptions to get to the low-end of our guidance."

Now let's discuss the fourth quarter. Global revenues for the fourth quarter were $973 million, up 14% from 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.30, up 78% from the $0.17 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. Cash flow from operations was $96 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million during the quarter. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.14 during the quarter at a cost of $20 million. We also repurchased 300,000 RHI shares for a total of $7.5 million. There remain approximately 6.1 million shares under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
Our specialized Staffing divisions and Protiviti reported solid results in the fourth quarter. This does mark the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the company. Additionally, growth rates and net income and earnings per share have significantly exceeded revenue growth rates during this period. This reflects the ongoing strong demand for skilled talent, particularly in the technology and accounting sectors.

It's a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 72 locations in 23 countries. Protiviti's International operations represent 26% of total Protiviti revenues. 
Now let's look at gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting Staffing operations was $282 million or 35.8% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 35.5% of revenues in the third quarter of 2011. The fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 included workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits of $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. 
Temp-to-hire conversions declined slightly during the quarter while pay bill spreads continued to expand. Our staffing gross margin was $357 million in the fourth quarter or 41.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 39.7% of revenues in the fourth quarter a year ago and 41.4% of revenues in the third quarter of 2011. Protiviti's fourth quarter gross margin was $30 million or 27.6% of Protiviti revenues compared to $30 million or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues in Q4 2010.

We ended 2011 with 9,000 full-time employees in our Staffing divisions, up 10% from the prior year. 
Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were $28 million or 25.4% of revenues. This compares to $27 million or 25.6% of revenues for the fourth quarter a year ago and $27 million or 24.6% of revenues for the third quarter of 2011. 
We ended the year with 2,700 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 4% from the prior year. Fourth quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $70 million or 8% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $64 million of this amount or 8.1% of applicable revenues. Fourth quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $6 million or 7.9% of applicable revenues. Protiviti operating income was $2 million in the fourth quarter or 2.2% of revenue.
Our fourth quarter 2011 income tax rate was 40.9% comparing to 38.8% in the third quarter of this year. The resulting $1.5 million negative impact was due primarily to lower utilization of foreign tax credits. Accounts receivable were $493 million at the end of the fourth quarter, with implied days outstanding or DSO of 46.1 days, which compares to 45.2 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We saw the following trends in the fourth quarter and the first few weeks of January. On a same-day sequential basis, Temporary and Consulting revenues were up in October, up in November and up again in December. On a same-day sequential basis, Permanent Placement revenues were down in October, down in November and down again in December. 
For the first 2 weeks of January, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 17% compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of January, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 38% compared to the same period last year. We caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate revenue trends over such short time periods. 
Taking into account these factors, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues, $960 million to $1,010,000,000; income per share, $0.25 to $0.30. It's our policy to limit guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Max."

We finished the year strongly with double-digit revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis.

We finished the year strongly with double-digit revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis. We were pleased to see continued strength in Technology Staffing during the quarter as well as year-over-year and sequential revenue gains in our other Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions. As we end one year and begin a new one, it's time to reflect not only where we've been in the past 12 months, but also what we believe are business opportunities ahead. 
We do feel the company is well positioned for several reasons. The unemployment rate among college-degreed workers is half that of the overall U.S. rate, which underscores the demand for professional level talent. The unemployment rate also is low in many of the occupations in which we specialize. The unemployment rate for Web developers, for example, is 3.6%, and for accountants and auditors, it is 4.9%. All of this has contributed to a stronger pricing environment for us. 
The U.S. economy added more than 1.6 million jobs last year, 400,000 more than the year before. There's been an increase in hiring by small and midsized businesses, which make up the largest percentage of our client base, as you know. This was reflected in the strong performance of our Permanent Placement division through the year 2011. 
We believe the revenue growth in our Temporary and Consulting divisions has been partly the result of more companies using variable cost labor as a component of their overall human resources strategy. In the coming years, we hope to see even wider adoption by employers of flexible staffing models, including the use of temporary and project professionals. 
Our headcount investments last year are benefiting us most notably in our Information Technology staffing division. We are optimistic about the possibilities within this technology sector. We also were encouraged by the growth potential of the accounting and finance segment, where we have long been the recognized leader. We were also pleased to see higher demand for Protiviti's Consulting and Internal Audit Services in 2011, particularly in the United States. Demand was strongest for Information Technology related services, as well as consulting solutions offered to the financial services industry. 
Our blended service model that combined skilled interim professionals from our Staffing divisions with the consulting expertise of Protiviti is creating a good business opportunity for us. We are delivering a full range of staffing and consulting services to our clients at what we believe is a very competitive price. We have solid leadership in our staffing operations in Protiviti. And I am confident in their abilities as we head into 2012. 
Finally, we are in a strong financial position. We had positive operating cash flow of $256 million in 2011, which helped us to fund approximately $142 million in RHI stock repurchases, $57 million in capital expenditures and the payment of $80 million in dividends to stockholders. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. Please limit yourselves as customary to one question and a single follow-up. If time permits, we'll certainly return to you later in the call, if you have additional questions. Thank you."

First of all, currency, understand at the income line, at the earnings per share line, currency has very, very little impact. The only reason we gave currency-adjusted figures is so you could better understand the revenue trends, particularly when you've got the kind of swings that we've had the last few quarters. So at the income line, currency is noise. At the revenue line, it helps you understand trends. Tax rate, one of the biggest differences between our expectations and what actually happened in Q4: We expected our tax rate to come down in Q4; it actually went up. That's related primarily to -- we made less money in Europe than we expected, and we had unused tax credits we had expected to use that didn't get used. As far as the guidance, our thinking is that the tax rate will be down a little bit again, but to be prudent, maybe you model it the same. So we had a 41% rate in the fourth quarter. Frankly, we expected to be down again in the first quarter in part because there are structuring ways for us to get those credits that we didn't get in the fourth quarter. So call it 40% to 41%. With a little luck, it might actually be a little lower. But again, biggest difference between guidance and actual for the fourth quarter actually was the tax rate. And now talking about guidance generally. So if you look at the high end of our range on the temp side, we're pretty much assuming that the growth rates we saw on a same day basis continue into the first quarter. We obviously have 3 more days which helps the absolute numbers. On the Perm side, we built in a little more conservatism into the first quarter than was the case -- than what we actually reported in the fourth quarter. That said, as I've talked about, we've had a pretty good start to the year. Perm order flow is still good even outside the U.S. The sales cycle does continue to get a bit longer. It's a bit unusual in that on the one hand, clients are getting more selective; they want to see more candidates. And at the same time, candidates are getting more selective. They're getting multiple offers, they're getting a counter from their employer. So it's a bit unusual that at the same time, you've got clients and candidates getting more selective. Usually, it's one or the other, depending on where you in the cycle. Clearly, Perm is stronger in the U.S. than it is non-U.S. But we did grow non-U.S. 19% year-over-year, which isn't chopped liver. Germany is obviously the strongest, followed by France and then Belgium. Clearly the most challenged is the U.K. Australia is what our people call a 2-speed economy. You've got mining and minerals that's doing really well. You've got the rest that's not doing so well. And our growth rates in Australia have been impacted as well. So back to guidance generally, we are more conservative in our Perm forecasted growth in the first quarter than we were -- we reported actually in the fourth quarter. If you then look at gross margin. We won't have the 30-basis-point lift from the workers comp credits that we had in the fourth quarter. So that will be a headwind in the first quarter. Further, we expect state unemployment rates to rise by about 20 basis points. We'll pass some of that through, but not all of that through. But net, we expect our temp gross margin to decline sequentially for the absence of the workers' comp and the higher SUI. At the SG&A line, we're considering that on the headcount side, Perm is going to be about flat. We're actually going to adjust the heads downward outside the U.S., and we're actually going to ramp up the technology Permanent Placement headcount in the U.S. to that extent. So it will be a push and be about the same. Temp, we continue to plan low single-digit additions to headcount. You'll get leverage from the 3 more days of revenue which will help SG&A to get down to the operating line. Temp would be down a little bit because gross margin's down the way I just described. Perm would be in the same range depending on how Perm revenues perform. Protiviti, sequentially Protiviti, it's toughest quarter is the first quarter. Revenues are typically down 10% to 15%. We lost a little money a year ago in the first quarter. While we're going to try not to this quarter, I think it would be prudent to forecast a loss of $1 million or $2 million as well in Protiviti. So that kind of defines the high end of the guidance. We then back off virtually all of those assumptions to get to the low end of our guidance."

Now let's discuss the first quarter. Global revenues for the first quarter were $1,020,000,000, an increase of 15% from the first quarter of 2011, income per share was $0.34, up 88% from the $0.18 per share reported in the first quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $23 million, capital expenditures were $10 million, we paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares for a total of $29 million, or approximately 5.1 million shares still available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We were pleased with the financial results for the quarter which were the result of continued strong demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services. This is the seventh straight quarter of the company has reported double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and each of this quarter's growth and net income earnings per share has greatly outpaced revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for more detailed review of our first quarter financial results."

As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially.

As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of 2011, and compared to 61.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher number of billing days had the effect of increasing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 5%, and year-over-year growth rates by 1.1%. The current quarter, has 63.1 billing days. Currency exchange rates reduced first quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and first quarter year-over-year revenues by $6 million. This had the effect of reducing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 0.1% and year-over-year growth rates by 0.8%. We've added a new supplemental schedule to the investor center of our website at rhi.com. It shows the year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported basis and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This information is presented for each of the quarters, beginning with the first quarter of 2011. We provided this data because we believe that better reflects our actual growth rate and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This data is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates also is available on our website. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues grew 16% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2011, with the U.S. growing 20% and international locations growing 9% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $652 million in the first quarter of this year, while International Staffing revenues for the quarter were $260 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 104 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were at $103 million, including $78 million in United States and $25 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 4% globally, with U.S. revenue up 9% and non-U.S. revenue down 7%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. 
Now, let's look at gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting staffing operations was 35.6% of applicable revenues. This was 125 basis point increase over the first quarter of last year, and only a 16 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of 2011. We were very pleased with our ability during the quarter to adjust our pay bill spreads to absorb the anticipated state unemployment tax increases, and also the absence of prior quarter workers compensation credits. Temp to hire conversions also rose modestly during quarter. Our mix of Permanent Placement revenues increased to 9.1% of staffing revenues for the quarter versus 8.6% a year ago. Together with the higher Temporary and Consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in a 150 basis point increase in overall staffing gross margin compared to the first quarter of 2011. Protiviti's gross margin was $24 million or 23% of Protiviti were revenues, compared to 25% of revenues a year-ago. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses cost. In the first quarter, our staffing SG&A cost were 32.4% of staffing revenues. This was an improvement of 180 basis points from the prior year. First quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 25.4% of revenues. This was a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year. First quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $82 million or 9% of staffing revenues, the temporary consulting divisions contributed $69 million of this amount or 8.3% of applicable revenues, first quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $13 million or 16% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating loss was $2 million in the first quarter, this was anticipated as the first quarter is typically Protiviti's seasonally weakest quarter. Accounts receivable were $523 million at the end of the first quarter, was implied days outstanding or DSO of 46.9 days compared to 48.2 days at the end of the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year Temporary and Consulting growth rates were up in January and down in February and March. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year Permanent Placement growth rates were down in January, February and March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues for our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues for our Permanent Placement division were up 35% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution however, that it's difficult to evaluate these trends over such short time periods. 
Taking this information into account, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.32 to $0.37; it's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release, consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include in the amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn it over back to Max."

We had another strong quarter with continued growth across our lines of business. Year-over-year growth rates in our domestic operations accelerated during the first quarter, economic signals were more mixed outside United States, particularly in Europe, which affected the revenues of our non-U.S. operations. However, we were quite pleased with our ability to control costs outside United States. We have said before on this call and repeat now that we believe a supply and demand imbalance is emerging in United States within many professional occupations. Unemployment rates for a number of positions at accounting and information technology, for example, are less than half the overall U.S rate. In many instances, we have benefited from a better pricing environment as a result of the tighter labor market for specialized word. We also have witnessed the return to hiring by small and midsized businesses in many of our markets. Although we serve companies of all sizes, the core of our client base is made up of small and midsized terms which sensitive higher premium on the service quality. Protiviti will mark its 10th anniversary and it continues to diversify its business solutions. In addition to its foundation practice and internal audit and internal controls-related services, Protiviti offers consulting services in areas such as finance, technology, compliance, operations, litigation and restructuring. Protiviti most significant growth areas recently have been an IT-related consulting as well as services geared towards the financial services industry. Another reason we are optimistic about the growth prospects for Robert Half is the change we believe is taking place in the way companies staff our operations. We are seeing wider adoption of flexible staffing models by businesses, including the use of temporary and project professionals. Flexibility of variable cost labor can give companies greater control over their human resources by just - and provide access to skilled talent, when, and for as long as, they need that talent. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

First of all, at the revenue level, it essentially says on the Temp side, the year-over-year growth rates remain intact. On the Perm side, the growth rates slow in part because of the monster quarter we had a year ago, where we were up 44%, and in part because we still have this environment where clients and candidates are simultaneously more selective which slows down replacement cycle. So our forecast even at the high-end dust project deceleration for Perm. Protiviti, seasonally, Q1 is soft, Q2 generally gets better. We're projecting mid-single-digit, low-to-mid single-digit year-over-year growth for Protiviti at the high-end. On the gross margins, we were particularly pleased during the quarter that we absorb the unemployment increase, the lack of workers comp credits. We would expect to make a little more progress in the high end of our guidance for Q2. Turning to SG&A, we got a lot of leverage as a couple of you have observed here. We expect less leverage in the second quarter than we had in the first. And by holding the international headcount around the same, that means the U.S. headcount increases, which would be single, single digit would come through overall, and result in not seeing as much operating leverage in the second quarter as the first, although we might still see a little bit. That would mean at the operating margin line, again at the high-end of our guidance, margins would be saying to a little bit expanded.

What's come on in a big way are IT consulting and financial services, particularly at risk and compliance as it relates to financial services, we're very pleased with how they progressed. In addition, there is a very real go-to-market opportunity, which we increasingly are more successful with, where staffing and Protiviti go-to-market together. Typically, it's where Protiviti provides supervision, there's consulting, there's deliverables, and many times from our staffing organization, you get the arms and the legs of the staff on the engagement. So we're bullish on Protiviti in its own right in the consulting space, particularly in IT and FSI. And as I said, we're increasingly more successful going to market, Protiviti together with staffing, we had nice winds this quarter. It's definitely gotten traction in the last 12 months, and we're very excited that Protiviti fits very naturally with staffing. At the end of the day, clients like choices.

Now let's discuss the first quarter. 
Global revenues for the first quarter were $1,020,000,000, an increase of 15% from the first quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.34, up 88% from the $0.18 per share reported in the first quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $23 million, capital expenditures were $10 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares for a total of $29 million. There are approximately 5.1 million shares still available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We were pleased with the financial results for the quarter which were the result of continued strong demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services. This is the seventh straight quarter of the company has reported double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. In each of these quarters' growth and net income and earnings per share has greatly outpaced revenue growth.

As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of 2011, and compared to 61.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher number of billing days had the effect of increasing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 5%, and year-over-year growth rates by 1.1%. The current quarter, has 63.1 billing days. 
Currency exchange rates reduced first quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and first quarter year-over-year revenues by $6 million. This had the effect of reducing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 0.1% and year-over-year growth rates by 0.8%. Beginning this quarter, we've added a new supplemental schedule to the investor center of our website at rhi.com. It shows the year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported basis and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This information is presented for each of the quarters, beginning with the first quarter of 2011. We provided this data because we believe that better reflects our actual growth rate and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This data is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. 
Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates also is available on our website. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues grew 16% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2011, with the U.S. growing 20% and international locations growing 9% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $652 million in the first quarter of this year, while International Staffing revenues for the quarter were $260 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 104 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were at $103 million, including $78 million in United States and $25 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 4% globally, with U.S. revenue up 9% and non-U.S. revenue down 7%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. 
Now, let's look at gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.6% of applicable revenues. This was 125 basis point increase over the first quarter of last year, and only a 16 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of 2011. We were very pleased with our ability during the quarter to adjust our pay bill spreads to absorb the anticipated state unemployment tax increases, and also the absence of prior quarter workers' compensation credits. Temp-to-hire conversions also rose modestly during quarter. Our mix of permanent placement revenues increased to 9.1% of staffing revenues for the quarter versus 8.6% a year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in a 150 basis point increase in overall staffing gross margin compared to the first quarter of 2011.    Protiviti's gross margin was $24 million or 23% of Protiviti were revenues, compared to 25% of revenues a year-ago. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses cost, in the first quarter, our staffing SG&A cost were 32.4% of staffing revenues. This was an improvement of 180 basis points from the prior year. First quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 25.4% of revenues. This was a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year. First quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $82 million or 9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $69 million of this amount or 8.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $13 million or 16% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating loss was $2 million in the first quarter, this was anticipated as the first quarter is typically Protiviti's seasonally weakest quarter. Accounts receivable were $523 million at the end of the first quarter, was implied days outstanding, or DSO, of 46.9 days compared to 48.2 days at the end of the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year temporary and consulting growth rates were up in January and down in February and March. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year permanent placement growth rates were down in January, February and March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues for our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues for our Permanent Placement division were up 35% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution however, that it's difficult to evaluate these trends over such short time periods. 
Taking this information into account, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.32 to $0.37. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter, all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn it over back to Max."

Year-over-year growth rates in our domestic operations accelerated during the first quarter. Economic signals were more mixed outside United States, particularly in Europe, which affected the revenues of our non-U.S. operations, however, we were quite pleased with our ability to control costs outside United States. We have said before, on this call and repeat now, that we believe a supply and demand imbalance is emerging in United States within many professional occupations. 
Unemployment rates for a number of positions at accounting and information technology, for example, are less than half the overall U.S rate. In many instances, we have benefited from a better pricing environment as a result of the tighter labor market for specialized plantilla [ph]. We also have witnessed the return to hiring by small and midsized businesses in many of our markets. Although we serve companies of all sizes, the core of our client base is made up of small and midsized firms which often are less price sensitive and tend to place a higher premium on the service quality. 
Protiviti will mark its 10th anniversary next month and it continues to diversify its business solutions. In addition to its foundation practice and internal audit and internal controls-related services, Protiviti offers consulting services in areas such as finance, technology, compliance, operations, litigation and restructuring. Protiviti's most significant growth areas recently have been in IT-related consulting as well as services geared towards the financial services industry. 
Another reason we are optimistic about the growth prospects for Robert Half is the change we believe is taking place in the way companies staff their operations. We are seeing wider adoption of flexible staffing models by businesses, including the use of temporary and project professionals. The flexibility of variable cost labor can give companies greater control over their human resources budgets and provide access to skilled talent when, and for as long as, they need that talent. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

So if you look at our guidance, at the high-end of our guidance, first of all, at the revenue level, it essentially says, on the temp side, the year-over-year growth rates remain intact. On the perm side, the growth rates slow in part because of the monster quarter we had a year ago, where we were up 44% and in part because we still have this environment where clients and candidates are simultaneously more selective, which slows down the placement cycle. So we're -- our forecast even at the high end does project deceleration for perm. Protiviti, seasonally, Q1 is soft, Q2 generally gets better. We're projecting mid-single-digit and  low-to-mid single-digit year-over-year growth for Protiviti at the high end. On the gross margins, we were particularly pleased during the quarter, that we absorb the unemployment increase, the lack of workers' comp credits. We would expect to make a little more progress in the high end of our guidance for Q2. Turning to SG&A, we got a lot of leverage as a couple of you have observed here. We expect less leverage in the second quarter than we had in the first. And by holding the international headcount around the same, that means the U.S. headcount increases, which would be single, single digit would come through overall, and result in not seeing as much operating leverage in the second quarter as the first, although we might still see a little bit. That would mean at the operating margin line, again at the high end of our guidance, the margins would be same to a little bit expanded.

And as I said, we're increasingly more successful going to market, Protiviti together with staffing, we had nice winds this quarter. It's definitely gotten traction in the last 12 months, and we're very excited that Protiviti fits very naturally with staffing. At the end of the day, clients like choices.

Or is there some blend of, I manage part of it, you manage part of it? You provide the arms and legs in part of it, you provide the consulting for part of it? Clients like choices.

We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Now let's discuss the first quarter. 
Global revenues for the first quarter were $1,020,000,000, an increase of 15% from the first quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.34, up 88% from the $0.18 per share reported in the first quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $23 million, capital expenditures were $10 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares for a total of $29 million. There are approximately 5.1 million shares still available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We were pleased with the financial results for the quarter which were the result of continued strong demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services. This is the seventh straight quarter of the company has reported double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. In each of these quarters growth and net income and earnings per share has greatly outpaced revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for more detailed review of our first quarter financial results."

As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of",911,"Thank you, Max. As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of 2011, and compared to 61.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher number of billing days had the effect of increasing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 5%, and year-over-year growth rates by 1.1%. The current quarter, has 63.1 billing days. 
Currency exchange rates reduced first quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and first quarter year-over-year revenues by $6 million. This had the effect of reducing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 0.1% and year-over-year growth rates by 0.8%. Beginning this quarter, we've added a new supplemental schedule to the investor center of our website at rhi.com. It shows the year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported basis and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This information is presented for each of the quarters, beginning with the first quarter of 2011. We provided this data because we believe it better reflects our actual growth rate and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This data is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. 
Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates also is available on our website. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues grew 16% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2011, with the U.S. growing 20% and international locations growing 9% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $652 million in the first quarter of this year, while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $260 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 104 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were at $103 million, including $78 million in United States and $25 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 4% globally, with U.S. revenue up 9% and non-U.S. revenue down 7%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. 
Now, let's look at gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.6% of applicable revenues. This was 125 basis point increase over the first quarter of last year, and only a 16 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of 2011. We were very pleased with our ability during the quarter to adjust our pay bill spreads to absorb the anticipated state unemployment tax increases, and also the absence of prior quarter workers' compensation credits. Temp-to-hire conversions also rose modestly during the quarter. Our mix of permanent placement revenues increased to 9.1% of staffing revenues for the quarter versus 8.6% a year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in a 150 basis point increase in overall staffing gross margins compared to the first quarter of 2011.    Protiviti's gross margin was $24 million or 23% of Protiviti were revenues, compared to 25% of revenues a year-ago. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses cost. In the first quarter, our staffing SG&A cost were 32.4% of staffing revenues. This was an improvement of 180 basis points from the prior year. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 25.4% of revenues. This was a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year. First quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $82 million or 9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $69 million of this amount or 8.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $13 million or 16% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating loss was $2 million in the first quarter. This was anticipated as the first quarter is typically Protiviti's seasonally weakest quarter. Accounts receivable were $523 million at the end of the first quarter, was implied days outstanding, or DSO, of 46.9 days compared to 48.2 days at the end of the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year temporary and consulting growth rates were up in January and down in February and March. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year permanent placement growth rates were down in January, February and March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues for our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues for our Permanent Placement division were up 35% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution however, that it's difficult to evaluate these trends over such short time periods. 
Taking this information into account, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.32 to $0.37. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn it over back to Max."

Year-over-year growth rates in our domestic operations accelerated during the first quarter. Economic signals were more mixed outside the United States, particularly in Europe, which affected the revenues of our non-U.S. operations; however, we were quite pleased with our ability to control costs outside United States. We have said before, on this call and repeat now, that we believe a supply and demand imbalance is emerging in United States within many professional occupations. 
Unemployment rates for a number of positions in accounting and information technology, for example, are less than half the overall U.S rate. In many instances, we have benefited from a better pricing environment as a result of the tighter labor market for specialized plantilla [ph]. We also have witnessed the return to hiring by small and midsized businesses in many of our markets. Although we serve companies of all sizes, the core of our client base is made up of small and midsized firms which often are less price sensitive and tend to place a higher premium on service quality. 
Protiviti will mark its 10th anniversary next month and it continues to diversify its business solutions. In addition to its foundation practice and internal audit and internal controls-related services, Protiviti offers consulting services in areas such as finance, technology, compliance, operations, litigation and restructuring. Protiviti's most significant growth areas recently have been in IT-related consulting as well as services geared toward the financial services industry. 
Another reason we are optimistic about the growth prospects for Robert Half is the change we believe is taking place in the way companies staff their operations. We are seeing wider adoption of flexible staffing models by businesses, including the use of temporary and project professionals. Flexibility of variable cost labor can give companies greater control over their human resources budgets and provide access to skilled talent when, and for as long as, they need that talent. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

Traditionally, when we talked about the progress during a quarter, we talked sequentially, and then we converted to year-over-year for the post-quarter start. That actually created quite a few calls and confused some people. So in combination with this new schedule, that I would encourage everybody to go look at on our website, it's year-over-year, constant currency, constant billing days, so that, that schedule reports on that basis. What we report during the course of the quarter just ended is on that basis. And what we report on our start, post-quarter, is on that basis.

So if you look at our guidance, at the high-end of our guidance, first of all, at the revenue level, it essentially says, on the temp side, the year-over-year growth rates remain intact. On the perm side, the growth rates slow in part because of the monster quarter we had a year ago, where we were up 44% and in part because we still have this environment where clients and candidates are simultaneously more selective, which slows down the placement cycle. So we're -- our forecast even at the high end does project deceleration for perm. Protiviti, seasonally, Q1 is soft, Q2 generally gets better. We're projecting mid-single-digit and  low-to-mid single-digit year-over-year growth for Protiviti at the high end. On the gross margins, we were particularly pleased during the quarter, that we absorbed the unemployment increase, the lack of workers' comp credits. We would expect to make a little more progress in the high end of our guidance for Q2. Turning to SG&A, we got a lot of leverage as a couple of you have observed here. We expect less leverage in the second quarter than we had in the first. By holding the international headcount around the same, that means the U.S. headcount increases, which would be single, single digit would come through overall, and result in not seeing as much operating leverage in the second quarter as the first, although we might still see a little bit. That would mean at the operating margin line, again at the high end of our guidance, the margins would be same to a little bit expanded. Across the board, Protiviti would clearly go from negative to positive.  So frankly, pretty straightforward. You take current quarter margins, apply to same kind of growth rates into Q2 and you've got your high end. There's nothing particularly complicated about it."

Before we begin, we would like to remind you, as usual, that comments made on today's call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.
We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described some of these risks and uncertainties in today's press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today's 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this call.
Now let's discuss the first quarter. 
Global revenues for the first quarter were $1,020,000,000, an increase of 15% from the first quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.34, up 88% from the $0.18 per share reported in the first quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $23 million, capital expenditures were $10 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares for a total of $29 million. There are approximately 5.1 million shares still available under our board approved stock repurchase plan. 
We were pleased with the financial results for the quarter which were the result of continued strong demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services. This is the seventh straight quarter of the company has reported double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. In each of these quarter’s growth and net income and earnings per share has greatly outpaced revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for more detailed review of our first quarter financial results."

As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of",912,"Thank you, Max. As you noted, first quarter revenues for the company were $1.02 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, and a 4% increase sequentially. We calculated 63.7 billing days in the first quarter compared to 63.1 days in the first quarter of 2011, and compared to 61.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The higher number of billing days had the effect of increasing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 5%, and year-over-year growth rates by 1.1%. The current quarter, has 63.1 billing days. 
Currency exchange rates reduced first quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and first quarter year-over-year revenues by $6 million. This had the effect of reducing first quarter 2012 sequential growth rates by 0.1% and year-over-year growth rates by 0.8%. Beginning this quarter, we've added a new supplemental schedule to the investor center of our website at rhi.com. It shows the year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported basis and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This information is presented for each of the quarters, beginning with the first quarter of 2011. We provided this data because we believe it better reflects our actual growth rate and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This data is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. 
Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates also is available on our website. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues grew 16% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2011, with the U.S. growing 20% and international locations growing 9% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $652 million in the first quarter of this year, while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $260 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 104 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were at $103 million, including $78 million in United States and $25 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 4% globally, with U.S. revenue up 9% and non-U.S. revenue down 7%. Protiviti and its independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. 
Now, let's look at gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.6% of applicable revenues. This was 125 basis point increase over the first quarter of last year, and only a 16 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of 2011. We were very pleased with our ability during the quarter to adjust our pay bill spreads to absorb the anticipated state unemployment tax increases, and also the absence of prior quarter workers' compensation credits. Temp-to-hire conversions also rose modestly during the quarter. Our mix of permanent placement revenues increased to 9.1% of staffing revenues for the quarter versus 8.6% a year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in a 150 basis point increase in overall staffing gross margins compared to the first quarter of 2011. Protiviti's gross margin was $24 million or 23% of Protiviti were revenues, compared to 25% of revenues a year ago. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses cost. In the first quarter, our staffing SG&A cost were 32.4% of staffing revenues. This was an improvement of 180 basis points from the prior year. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 25.4% of revenues. This was a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year. First quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $82 million or 9% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed $69 million of this amount or 8.3% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $13 million or 16% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating loss was $2 million in the first quarter. This was anticipated as the first quarter is typically Protiviti's seasonally weakest quarter. Accounts receivable were $523 million at the end of the first quarter, was implied days outstanding, or DSO, of 46.9 days compared to 48.2 days at the end of the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's turn to second quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the first quarter and the first few weeks of April. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year temporary and consulting growth rates were up in January and down in February and March. On a same-day constant currency basis, year-over-year permanent placement growth rates were down in January, February and March. During the first 2 weeks of April, revenues for our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 15% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of April, revenues for our Permanent Placement division were up 35% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution however, that it's difficult to evaluate these trends over such short time periods. 
Taking this information into account, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.32 to $0.37. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with past quarters, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn it over back to Max."

Year-over-year growth rates in our domestic operations accelerated during the first quarter. Economic signals were more mixed outside the United States, particularly in Europe, which affected the revenues of our non-U.S. operations; however, we were quite pleased with our ability to control costs outside United States. We have said before, on this call and repeat now, that we believe a supply and demand imbalance is emerging in United States within many professional occupations. 
Unemployment rates for a number of positions in accounting and information technology, for example, are less than half the overall U.S rate. In many instances, we have benefited from a better pricing environment as a result of the tighter labor market for specialized plantilla [ph]. We also have witnessed the return to hiring by small and midsized businesses in many of our markets. Although we serve companies of all sizes, the core of our client base is made up of small and midsized firms which often are less price sensitive and tend to place a higher premium on service quality. 
Protiviti will mark its 10th anniversary next month and it continues to diversify its business solutions. In addition to its foundation practice and internal audit and internal controls-related services, Protiviti offers consulting services in areas such as finance, technology, compliance, operations, litigation and restructuring. Protiviti's most significant growth areas recently have been in IT-related consulting as well as services geared toward the financial services industry. 
Another reason we are optimistic about the growth prospects for Robert Half is the change we believe is taking place in the way companies staff their operations. We are seeing wider adoption of flexible staffing models by businesses, including the use of temporary and project professionals. Flexibility of variable cost labor can give companies greater control over their human resources budgets and provide access to skilled talent when, and for as long as, they need that talent. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will try to return to you later in the call if you have additional questions. Thank you."

Traditionally, when we talked about the progress during a quarter, we talked sequentially, and then we converted to year-over-year for the post-quarter start. That actually created quite a few calls and confused some people. So in combination with this new schedule, that I would encourage everybody to go look at on our website, it's year-over-year, constant currency, constant billing days, so that, that schedule reports on that basis. What we report during the course of the quarter just ended is on that basis. And what we report on our start, post-quarter, is on that basis.

So if you look at our guidance, at the high-end of our guidance, first of all, at the revenue level, it essentially says, on the temp side, the year-over-year growth rates remain intact. On the perm side, the growth rates slow in part because of the monster quarter we had a year ago, where we were up 44% and in part because we still have this environment where clients and candidates are simultaneously more selective, which slows down the placement cycle. So we're -- our forecast even at the high end does project deceleration for perm. Protiviti, seasonally, Q1 is soft, Q2 generally gets better. We're projecting mid-single-digit and  low-to-mid single-digit year-over-year growth for Protiviti at the high end. On the gross margins, we were particularly pleased during the quarter, that we absorbed the unemployment increase, the lack of workers' comp credits. We would expect to make a little more progress in the high end of our guidance for Q2. Turning to SG&A, we got a lot of leverage as a couple of you have observed here. We expect less leverage in the second quarter than we had in the first. By holding the international headcount around the same, that means the U.S. headcount increases, which would be single, single digit would come through overall, and result in not seeing as much operating leverage in the second quarter as the first, although we might still see a little bit. That would mean at the operating margin line, again at the high end of our guidance, the margins would be same to a little bit expanded. Across the board, Protiviti would clearly go from negative to positive.  So frankly, pretty straightforward. You take current quarter margins, apply to same kind of growth rates into Q2 and you've got your high end. There's nothing particularly complicated about it."

Now let's discuss the second quarter. Global revenues for the second quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% from the second quarter of 2011. Income per share was $32.02, up 28% from the second quarter of last year. Net income and income per share this quarter were reduced by $8.1 million or $0.06 per share related to a nonrecurring litigation settlement and the resolution of certain tax matters disclosed in our July 5, 2012, 8-K filing. 
Cash flow from operations during the second quarter were $92 million, capital expenditures were $14 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share of a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1.5 million RHI shares for a total of $43 million. There are approximately 3.6 million shares still available under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services remains stronger during the quarter, particularly our U.S. staffing operations, which grew 17% versus the prior year. Gross margin continue to expand with an increasing mix of Permanent Placement and temp-to-hire conversion revenues. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results."

As you noted, second quarter revenues for the company were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% over last year, and an increase of 1% sequentially. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 13% year-over-year with the U.S. growing 17% and international locations growing 3% on this basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $672 million in the second quarter of this year while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $246 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, and including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. 
We calculated 63.1 billing days in the second quarter compared to 63.3 days in last year's second quarter, and compared to 63.8 days in the first quarter of 2012. The lower number of billing days had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.4% in the second quarter. The current quarter have 63.2 billing days. 
Currency exchange rates reduced second quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $5 million and second quarter year-over-year revenues by $22 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2.4% in the second quarter. 
Last quarter, we added a new supplemental schedule to the Investors' Center of our website at rhi.com. We have included a supplemental schedule again this quarter, both on our website and in our earnings press release. The schedule shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between the U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Their information is presented for each of the 5 previous quarters, we've provided this information because we believe that better reflects our actual growth rates and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This information is considered to be a non-GAAP financial matter -- measure. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates, also is available on our website. 
Second quarter revenues for Protiviti were $110 million, including $83 million in the United States and $27 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 5% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue down 8%. Protiviti and this independently-owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries.
Now, let's look at gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our Temporary and Consulting staffing operations was 35.8% of applicable revenues. This was an 80 basis points increase over the second quarter of last year, and a 20 basis points increase from the first quarter of 2012. The quarter-to-quarter increase relates primarily to higher temp-to-hire conversions, while the year-over-year increase relates primarily to higher pay bill spreads. The most recent semiannual actuarial review of our workers compensation reserves resulted in a second quarter credit of $400,000 compared to $1.3 million a year ago. 
Perm placement revenue was 9.7% of staffing revenue for the quarter. Together with the higher Temporary and Consulting gross margin previously discussed, this resulted in an 80 basis point increase in overall staffing gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. Protiviti's second quarter gross margin was $29 million, 26.4% of Protiviti revenue compared to $28 million or 26.9% of revenue  a year ago.
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost in the second quarter, our SG&A cost and staffing were 34.4% of staffing revenues, including the nonrecurring charge of 2.1% of revenues related to the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Absent this charge, SG&A would have improved by 170 basis points from the prior year. 
Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 24.6% of revenue, this was 140 basis point improvement from the prior year. Second quarter operating income from our Staffing divisions was $70 million or 7.6% of staffing revenues. This was reduced by 2.1% of revenues for the aforementioned litigation charge. 
The Temporary and Consulting divisions reported $52 million in operating income for the quarter, 6.2% of applicable revenues. Second quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $18 million or 20.6% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $2 million in the second quarter compared to $1 million in the second quarter a year ago. Accounts receivable were $532 million with implied days outstanding of 47.1 days, this compares to 48.1 days at the end of the second quarter last year.
Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July. On a same-day constant currency basis, for our Temporary and Consulting Staffing divisions, the year-over-year growth rates in April were about the same as March, then the growth rates gradually moderated in May and June. On a same-day constant currency basis for our Permanent Placement business, the year-over-year growth rates decelerated slightly in April, decelerated further in May, and then were about the same in June as in May. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues for our Temporary and Consulting businesses were up 8% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of July, Permanent Placement revenues were up 37% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.
Taking this information into account, we offer the following third quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.36 to $0.41. It is our policy to limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based demand for our professional staffing and consulting services during the quarter. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the company on a same-day constant currency basis. Our results were strong as domestically, both within our staffing operations and Protiviti, our growth rates outside United States were not as strong, owing a large measure to ongoing concerns over the European debt prices; our business has limited exposure to the hardest countries in Europe, but we did feel some of the effects of a more cautious business environment and lower currency exchange rates in Europe and other parts of the world. We continue to aggressively manage non-U.S. operating costs.
We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the temporary staffing issues in the United States. Since March 2010, when non-farm payrolls  reached their lowest rate in the current cycle, 17% of U.S. jobs created have been temporary ones versus 8% in the comparable period in the prior cycle. We believe skilled temporary professionals are becoming a permanent part of the human resources mix for a growing number of businesses. 
Our Protiviti business also had a solid quarter particularly in the United States, as a result of higher demand for its consulting services. Among other areas, Protiviti is benefiting from growth in IT-related consulting services, as well as its consulting businesses specializes in the financial services industry. 
At this time, Keith and I are happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

While on a reported basis, the range which show growth rates of 3% to 8% between low and high, if you adjust that for currency and days, that would instead be 7% to 12%. The 12% being real close to the 13% we just reported for the second quarter. The 7% at the low end being just west than the post-quarter start we got, which we're hoping was July 4th impacted. The third quarter will be more impacted by currency and be more impacted by days than was the second quarter. As to currency, the biggest impact is on the euro. A year ago, the euro was $1.41. The current euro was at $1.21. We think the currency will probably have 3  growth rate points impact in the third quarter. Further on the days, we'll have 1 fewer day in the third quarter than the third quarter a year ago, which will impact the growth rate by 1.5 points. So whereas in the second quarter just ended, there was about a 3 point differential between reported growth and real growth, which is constant currency same-day.

And if you look at the growth rate, I would not say it's overly growth constraining. Generally speaking, the better candidates across our lines of business still get multiple offers, they still get counteroffers from their current employers, particularly on the perm side. So while there are pockets of supply issues by  line of business, I don't think it rises overall that it's terribly growth constraining. We see job order flow is remaining steady. We see demand remaining solid. We would say that clients are getting a little more methodical with their hiring processes. The hiring process is a little bit slower, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. We're seeing some deceleration in our growth rates, even in the U.S. But it's deceleration against a very high growth rates and the growth rates that remain, were quite pleased with this environment. And I'll make a further environment issue. If you look at our revenues for this quarter, when the unemployment rate was 8.2%, you have to go back to 2006 to find similar revenues, and at that time, the unemployment rate was 4.5%. So we're quite happy that we can return to revenue levels in the U.S. where unemployment rates were 4.5% versus today, where unemployment rates are 8.2%. The point being, if we can ever get those unemployment rates down to a more normal recovery level, we think we can do significantly better."

We believe these remarks to be reasonable but would remind you that they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this call.
Now let's discuss the second quarter. Global revenues for the second quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% from the second quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.32, up 28% from the second quarter of last year. Net income and income per share this quarter were reduced by $8.1 million, or $0.06 per share, related to a nonrecurring litigation settlement and the resolution of certain tax matters disclosed in our July 5, 2012, 8-K filing.
Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $92 million. Capital expenditures were $14 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1.5 million RHI shares for a total of $43 million. There are approximately 3.6 million shares still available under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services remains strong during the quarter, particularly in our U.S. staffing operations, which grew 17% versus the prior year. Gross margins continued to expand with an increasing mix of permanent placement and temp-to-hire conversion revenues.
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results."
276703,214321577,329772,"Robert Half International Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Robert Half Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Max. As you noted, second quarter revenues for the company were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% over last year, or an increase of 1% sequentially.

As you noted, second quarter revenues for the company were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% over last year, or an increase of 1% sequentially. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 13% year-over-year, with the U.S. growing 17% and international locations growing 3% on this basis.
U.S. staffing revenues were $672 million in the second quarter of this year, while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $246 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S.
We calculated 63.1 billing days in the second quarter compared to 63.3 days in last year's second quarter, and compared to 63.8 days in the first quarter of 2012. The lower number of billing days had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.4% in the second quarter. The current quarter has 63.2 billing days.
Currency exchange rates reduced second quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $5 million and second quarter year-over-year revenues by $22 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2.4% in the second quarter.
Last quarter, we added a new supplemental schedule to the Investors' Center of our website at rhi.com. We have included a supplemental schedule again this quarter, both on our website and in our earnings press release. The schedule shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between the U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Their information is presented for each of the 5 previous quarters. We've provided this information because we believe it better reflects our actual growth rates and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This information is considered to be a non-GAAP financial matter -- measure. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates also is available on our website.
Second quarter revenues for Protiviti were $110 million, including $83 million in the United States and $27 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 5% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue down 8%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries.
Now let's look at gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.8% of applicable revenues. This was an 80-basis-point increase over the second quarter of last year and a 20-basis-points increase from the first quarter of 2012. The quarter-to-quarter increase relates primarily to higher temp-to-hire conversions, while the year-over-year increase relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The most recent semiannual actuarial review of our workers' compensation reserves resulted in a second quarter credit of $400,000 compared to $1.3 million a year ago.
Perm placement revenue was 9.7% of staffing revenue for the quarter. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in an 80-basis-point increase in overall staffing gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. Protiviti's second quarter gross margin was $29 million, 26.4% of Protiviti revenue compared to $28 million or 26.9% of revenue a year ago.
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost. In the second quarter, our SG&A, cost and staffing were 34.4% of staffing revenues, including the nonrecurring charge of 2.1% of revenues related to the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Absent this charge, SG&A would have improved by 170 basis points from the prior year.
Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 24.6% of revenue. This was a 140-basis-point improvement from the prior year. Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $70 million, or 7.6% of staffing revenues. This was reduced by 2.1% of revenues for the aforementioned litigation charge. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $52 million in operating income for the quarter, or 6.2% of applicable revenues.
Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million, or 20.6% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $2 million in the second quarter compared to $1 million in the second quarter a year ago. Accounts receivable were $532 million, with implied days outstanding of 47.1 days. This compares to 48.1 days at the end of the second quarter last year.
Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July: on a same-day constant currency basis, for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, the year-over-year growth rates in April were about the same as March, then the growth rates gradually moderated in May and June; on a same-day constant currency basis for our permanent placement business, the year-over-year growth rates decelerated slightly in April, decelerated further in May and then were about the same in June as in May. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 8% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues were up 37% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.
Taking this information into account, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.36 to $0.41. It is our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance did not -- does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based demand for our professional staffing and consulting services during the quarter. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the company on a same-day constant currency basis. Our results were strongest domestically, both within our staffing operations and Protiviti. Our growth rates outside the United States were not as strong, owing in large measure to ongoing concerns over the European debt crisis. Our business has limited exposure to the hardest-hit countries in Europe, but we did feel some of the effects of a more cautious business environment and lower currency exchange rates in Europe and other parts of the world. We continue to aggressively manage non-U.S. operating costs.
We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the temporary staffing industry in the United States. Since March 2010, when nonfarm payrolls reached their lowest point in the current cycle, 17% of U.S. jobs created have been temporary ones versus 8% in the comparable period in the prior cycle. We believe skilled temporary professionals are becoming a permanent part of the human resources mix for a growing number of businesses.
Our Protiviti business also had a solid quarter, particularly in the United States, as a result of higher demand for its consulting services. Among other areas, Protiviti is benefiting from growth in IT-related consulting services, as well as its consulting business that specializes in the financial services industry.
At this time, Keith and I are happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

Let's talk a little bit about guidance generally. While on a reported basis, the range which show growth rates of 3% to 8% between low and high, if you adjust that for currency and days, that would instead be 7% to 12%. The 12% being real close to the 13% we just reported for the second quarter, the 7% at the low end being just less than the post-quarter start we got, which we're hoping was July 4-impacted. The third quarter will be more impacted by currency and be more impacted by days than was the second quarter. As to currency, the biggest impact is in the euro. A year ago, the euro was $1.41. The current euro is at $1.21. We think the currency will probably have 3 growth-rate points impact in the third quarter. Further, on the days, we'll have 1 fewer day in the third quarter than the third quarter a year ago, which will impact the growth rate by 1.5 points. So whereas in the second quarter just ended, there was about a 3-point differential between reported growth and real growth, which is constant currency same-day. In the third quarter, we think there'll be a 4- or 5-point differential between the real growth and reported growth."

And if you'd look at the growth rates, I would not say it's overly growth-constraining. Generally speaking, the better candidates across our lines of business still get multiple offers. They still get counteroffers from their current employers, particularly on the perm side. So while there are pockets of supply issues by line of business, I don't think it rises overall that it's terribly growth-constraining. We see -- job order flow is remaining steady. We see demand remaining solid. We would say that clients are getting a little more methodical with their hiring processes. The hiring process is a little bit slower, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. We're seeing some deceleration in our growth rates, even in the U.S., but it's deceleration against very high growth rates. And the growth rates that remain, we're quite pleased with in this environment. And I'll make a further environmental issue. If you look at our revenues for this quarter when the unemployment rate was 8.2%, you have to go back to 2006 to find similar revenues. And at that time, the unemployment rate was 4.5%. So we're quite happy that we could return to revenue levels in the U.S. where unemployment rates were 4.5% versus today, where unemployment rates are 8.2%. The point being, if we can ever get those unemployment rates down to a more normal recovery level, we think we can do significantly better."

But generally, quarter 3 is when Protiviti has its strongest operating margins of the year. We've talked before, our long-term objective, which we remain optimistic about is that Protiviti can have consolidated double-digit margins. We're not there yet, but we're pleased with the U.S. margins, which are expanding, and we think will expand further.

Now let's discuss the second quarter. Global revenues for the second quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% from the second quarter of 2011. Income per share was $0.32, up 28% from the second quarter of last year. Net income and income per share this quarter were reduced by $8.1 million, or $0.06 per share, related to a nonrecurring litigation settlement and the resolution of certain tax matters disclosed in our July 5, 2012, 8-K filing.
Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $92 million. Capital expenditures were $14 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1.5 million RHI shares for a total of $43 million. There are approximately 3.6 million shares still available under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our specialized staffing and consulting services remains strong during the quarter, particularly in our U.S. staffing operations, which grew 17% versus the prior year. Gross margins continued to expand with an increasing mix of permanent placement and temp-to-hire conversion revenues.
Now I'll turn the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results."

As you noted, second quarter revenues for the company were $1.03 billion, an increase of 10% over last year, or an increase of 1% sequentially. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 13% year-over-year, with the U.S. growing 17% and international locations growing 3% on this basis.
U.S. staffing revenues were $672 million in the second quarter of this year, while international staffing revenues for the quarter were $246 million. We have 353 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S.
We calculated 63.1 billing days in the second quarter compared to 63.3 days in last year's second quarter, and compared to 63.8 days in the first quarter of 2012. The lower number of billing days had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 0.4% in the second quarter. The current quarter has 63.2 billing days.
Currency exchange rates reduced second quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $5 million and second quarter year-over-year revenues by $22 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2.4% in the second quarter.
Last quarter, we added a new supplemental schedule to the Investors' Center of our website at rhi.com. We have included a supplemental schedule again this quarter, both on our website and in our earnings press release. The schedule shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on both a reported and also a same-day constant currency basis. It further splits the data between the U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Their information is presented for each of the 5 previous quarters. We've provided this information because we believe it better reflects our actual growth rates and aids in the evaluation of revenue trends over time. This information is considered to be a non-GAAP financial matter -- measure. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these growth rates to reported growth rates, also is available on our website.
Second quarter revenues for Protiviti were $110 million, including $83 million in the United States and $27 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 5% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue down 8%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries.
Now let's look at gross margin. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 35.8% of applicable revenues. This was an 80-basis-point increase over the second quarter of last year and a 20-basis-points increase from the first quarter of 2012. The quarter-to-quarter increase relates primarily to higher temp-to-hire conversions, while the year-over-year increase relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The most recent semiannual actuarial review of our workers' compensation reserves resulted in a second quarter credit of $400,000 compared to $1.3 million a year ago.
Perm placement revenue was 9.7% of staffing revenue for the quarter. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins previously discussed, this resulted in an 80-basis-point increase in overall staffing gross margin compared to last year's second quarter. Protiviti's second quarter gross margin was $29 million, 26.4% of Protiviti revenue compared to $28 million or 26.9% of revenue a year ago.
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost. In the second quarter, our SG&A, cost in staffing were 34.4% of staffing revenues, including the nonrecurring charge of 2.1% of revenues related to the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Absent this charge, SG&A would have improved by 170 basis points from the prior year.
Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 24.6% of revenue. This was a 140-basis-point improvement from the prior year. Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $70 million, or 7.6% of staffing revenues. This was reduced by 2.1% of revenues for the aforementioned litigation charge. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $52 million in operating income for the quarter, or 6.2% of applicable revenues.
Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million, or 20.6% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $2 million in the second quarter compared to $1 million in the second quarter a year ago. Accounts receivable were $532 million, with implied days outstanding of 47.1 days. This compares to 48.1 days at the end of the second quarter last year.
Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the second quarter and the first few weeks of July: on a same-day constant currency basis, for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, the year-over-year growth rates in April were about the same as March, then the growth rates gradually moderated in May and June; on a same-day constant currency basis for our permanent placement business, the year-over-year growth rates decelerated slightly in April, decelerated further in May and then were about the same in June as in May. During the first 2 weeks of July, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 8% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues were up 37% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would caution, however, it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.
Taking this information into account, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.36 to $0.41. It is our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance did not -- does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the company on a same-day constant currency basis. Our results were strongest domestically, both within our staffing operations and Protiviti. Our growth rates outside the United States were not as strong, owing in large measure to ongoing concerns over the European debt crisis. Our business has limited exposure to the hardest-hit countries in Europe, but we did feel some of the effects of a more cautious business environment and lower currency exchange rates in Europe and other parts of the world. We continue to aggressively manage non-U.S. operating costs.
We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the temporary staffing industry in the United States. Since March 2010, when non-foreign payrolls reached their lowest point in the current cycle, 17% of U.S. jobs created have been temporary ones versus 8% in the comparable period in the prior cycle. We believe skilled temporary professionals are becoming a permanent part of the human resources mix for a growing number of businesses.
Our Protiviti business also had a solid quarter, particularly in the United States, as a result of higher demand for its consulting services. Among other areas, Protiviti is benefiting from growth in IT-related consulting services, as well as its consulting business that specializes in the financial services industry.
At this time, Keith and I are happy to answer questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question and a single follow-up, as needed. If time permits, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

That deceleration continued post quarter, although we would caution that post quarter is heavily impacted by Fourth of July, which, as you know, this year, fell on a Wednesday. Many of our clients took the whole week off. And so we're a little suspicious that the post-quarter numbers were overly impacted by Fourth of July. But again, it's hard to know that for sure. As to investing, we will continue to invest in tech, both in the U.S. and in Germany. That continues to do quite well. And we'll also continue to invest in perm, consistent with the revenue gains that we see, but pretty much in line with the revenue gains that we see."

Let's talk a little bit about guidance generally. While on a reported basis, the range which show growth rates of 3% to 8% between low and high, if you adjust that for currency and days, that would instead be 7% to 12%. The 12% being real close to the 13% we just reported for the second quarter, the 7% at the low end being just less than the post-quarter start we got, which we're hoping was July 4-impacted. The third quarter will be more impacted by currency and be more impacted by days than was the second quarter. As to currency, the biggest impact is in the euro. A year ago, the euro was $1.41. The current euro is at $1.21. We think the currency will probably have 3 growth-rate points impact in the third quarter. Further, on the days, we'll have 1 fewer day in the third quarter than the third quarter a year ago, which will impact the growth rate by 1.5 points. So whereas in the second quarter just ended, there was about a 3-point differential between reported growth and real growth, which is constant currency same-day. In the third quarter, we think there'll be a 4- or 5-point differential between the real growth and reported growth."

We see demand remaining solid. We would say that clients are getting a little more methodical with their hiring processes. The hiring process is a little bit slower, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. We're seeing some deceleration in our growth rates, even in the U.S., but it's deceleration against very high growth rates. And the growth rates that remain, we're quite pleased with in this environment. And I'll make a further environmental issue. If you look at our revenues for this quarter when the unemployment rate was 8.2%, you have to go back to 2006 to find similar revenues. And at that time, the unemployment rate was 4.5%. So we're quite happy that we could return to revenue levels in the U.S. where unemployment rates were 4.5% versus today, where unemployment rates are 8.2%.

Now let's discuss the third quarter. Global revenues for the third quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2011 on a same-day, constant currency basis. Income per share was $0.41, up 33% from the third quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $76 million. Capital expenditures were $12 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the third quarter at the cost of $27 million. In August, our board authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to an additional 10 million shares of e company's common stock. There are approximately 12.6 million shares still available under this board approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with the company's operating performance during the third quarter. For the ninth consecutive quarter, U.S. staffing revenues  double-digit year-over-year growth rates. In addition, global operating income grew by 31% with higher gross margins. Lower selling, general and administrative expense ratios and strong Protiviti results.
Now turning the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results."

As you noted, third quarter revenues were $1.03 billion, a reported increase of 5% over last year. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 8% year-over-year with the U.S. growing by 12% and international locations declining 1% on this basis.
U.S. staffing revenues were $674 million on the third quarter while international staffing revenues were $240 million. We have 351 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. We calculated 63.3 billing days in the third quarter compared to 64.1 days in last year's third quarter, the effect of which was a 1.3% reduction in year-over-year staffing growth rates in the third quarter. The current fourth quarter has 62 billing days. Currency exchange rates reduced third quarter of 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million, and third quarter year-over-year revenues by $19 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2% in the third quarter.
Earlier this year, we began providing a supplemental schedule with our earnings results. The supplemental schedule is a non-GAAP financial measure that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as same-day constant currency basis. It further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today's press release and in the investor center of our website.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $119 million, including 93 in the U.S. and $26 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 8% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue remaining flat. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations and 22 countries. Now let's look at gross margin.
Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.2% of applicable revenues. This was a 70 basis point increase over the third quarter of last year and a 40 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2012. The improvements reflect continued strength in pay bill spreads, modestly lower French benefit costs, which more than offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion fees. Permanent placement revenue was 8.9% of staffing revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than the 9% of revenue from 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus 1 year ago.
Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $32 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues compared to $30 million or 27.5% of revenues a year ago.
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost, in the third quarter, our staffing SG&A's costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues, down 120 basis points from the 33.5% reported a year ago.
Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 32% of revenues, this is a 260 basis point improvement from the 24.6% level reported last year.
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $88 million or 9.7% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $76 million in operating income for the quarter or 9.1% of applicable revenues.
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $12 million or 15.3% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $6 million for the quarter or 5% of revenues compared to $3 million in the third quarter a year ago or 3% of revenues.
Accounts receivable were $557 million at the end of the third quarter, with implied days outstanding of 49 days compared to 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter 2011.
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated in July, then remained fairly constant in August and September. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement division decelerated in July, but 3 accelerated in August and September. Outside the U.S., our year-over-year growth rates decelerated throughout the quarter, turning negative in August and September.
During the first week of October, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 7% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 2 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues were up 36% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would again caution that it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.
Taking all of this information into account, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.38 to $0.43. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risk mentioned in today's press release, consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims. Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Year-over-year growth rates for the staffing business in Protiviti remain solid during the quarter, particularly in the United States. International operations were impacted by a continued economic uncertainty in parts of Europe. We have limited exposure in the hardest hit European countries but the debt crisis resulted in a more cautious business climate overall, which did affect international operations. As we noted on last quarter's call, we are taking proactive steps to reduce our non-U.S. operating cost.
Taking a look at Protiviti as noted earlier, we were pleased to see solid year-over-year growth in this business, as was the case with our staffing divisions, growth in U.S. operations was largely responsible for the strong results. Information Technology consulting and financial services risk and compliance services remain 2 of the fastest-growing business segments for Protiviti's services. In our staffing operations, our U.S. offices are seeing rising demand for professional staffing and consulting services. This was evidenced by solid growth rates for accounts in Robert Half Management Resources during the quarter. Demand for flexible staff inclusions also has remained strong. Temporary and contingent workers now make up 1.9% of total U.S. nonfarm employment, up from a low of 1.34% in June 2009. Current penetration rates are approaching the all-time high level of 2% in April 2000, notwithstanding the high current U.S. unemployment rates. That U.S. unemployment rate declined from 8.1% to 7.8% in September. The unemployment rate for skilled college degree workers, which is our sweet spot, remains at approximately 1/2 that rate. This underscores the dual job market we have referenced many times. Our clients are facing candidate shortages in many of the field of which we specialize. Helping them to hire this hard-to-find talent is what we do. Our professionals have both the time and expertise it takes for personal interviews, technical skills evaluations, reference checks, soft skills assessments and finally making the best match with the company's unique culture. We do bring the clients a unique insight into candidate skills and personality fit gained through our proprietary testing processes, direct interaction with the people we place and most important, direct client feedback. At this time, Keith, and I will be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] If time permits, as usual, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call."

I was wondering if you could talk more about what you're doing in some of the international markets in terms of the cost reductions that's certainly -- it comes through in terms of taking a look at the SG&A as a percentage of revenue, but wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And then if you could also discuss 2 other things: one, would be the Perm revenue, what your expectations are over there for the fourth quarter as implied in your guidance. And then lastly, Max, I appreciate the comments that you gave at the very end of your prepared remarks with regards to the value that you add. Can you talk a little bit about obviously, I think most of the people in this call are aware of that one report that came out from somebody who doesn't follow the industry about potential disintermediation. Can you talk just a little bit about the client profile that you have, particularly on the Perm side on both domestically and international just in terms of the size of those clients, and how likely it would be that they might disintermediate you?"

First of all, if you look country by country, we still had very strong numbers in Germany that were up solid double digits. We were up year-over-year in Australia. The other European and other global markets did have negative year-over-year growth rates, which were expected. As we talked about last quarter, we have more intently focused on our SG&A cost outside the U.S. They again did a very good job matching their cost structure with their revenues. We would expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. We are reducing headcount where the revenues dictate, by the same token we are investing headcount in the countries where that makes sense, principally Germany. Regarding Perm revenue expectations for Q4 internationally, understand that unlike Q3 where the August holidays have an impact disproportionately on Perm non-U.S., you have a longer quarter in the fourth quarter. That said, there's always uncertainty about December with clients running out of hiring authority from a budget standpoint. If you look historically, Perm globally, U.S. and non-U.S., in the fourth quarter, is flattish to slightly down sequentially with the third, and our guidance wouldn't be that different. This issue around disintermediation, client size, et cetera, so I'll get to the clients. The easy part first, is our client size, in our sweet spot is 75 to 100 employees. That client group, for the most part, chooses not to have the fixed cost of carrying their own recruiters and instead, outsources that to us on a risk-free, contingency basis. And the social media opportunities of the last few years haven't really changed that. But let me back up a little and just to make sure we level said and that everybody's talking about the same information, first of all, with respect to our temporary and consulting divisions, which are 80% of our consolidated operating income, understand that very few companies, regardless of size, want to recruit and manage their own temporary pools, which is very labor-intensive. A large motivation there is they don't want the co-employment risk. They don't want to worry about whether the temporaries have to or would qualify for their various benefit plans. Further, it's very -- as I said, labor-intensive to manage temporary pools. Further, these social media sites are primarily catering to passive candidates that already have a job for the most part, passive candidates who already have a job overwhelmingly are not willing to consider temporary assignments. Further, digital candidate databases for active jobseekers, which are relevant to our temporary business, have been around for more than 10 years, i.e. the job boards. And we've coexisted just fine. I would further say that there's actually a net positive to our temporary and consulting divisions in that our temporary recruiters do use social media for client development and do use social media for candidate referrals. So now let's move to the impact to our permanent placement division. I would first, from a context standpoint, set forth that our permanent placement operating income is about 13% of our consolidated total. I would further say that candidate identification is a small portion of the full placement process. There's a long lead time involved to convert a passive candidate into a newly hired employee. The full placement process is very time-consuming. You must engage, you must interview, you must evaluate hard and soft skills. You must match. All of which Max talked about earlier. Further, we would say that there's some -- these economies of scale in that the better candidates are already being bombarded with solicitations from recruiters to the extent more recruiters use social media that better candidates are going to get further bombarded, meaning they're less likely to respond. We would further observe that this huge pool of passive candidates to the recruiter, in many cases, our tire kickers. They love to hear about all of the possible job opportunities available to them but frankly, they're not willing to change jobs. Again, making the full placement process even more time-consuming. The majority of our candidates still come from referrals, not social media, still come from RHI's internal databases and our other traditional sources. Our recruiters, which we believe are some of the best on the planet, have unique insights into candidates through testing, through client evaluations. You're never going to get client feedback on a social media site. Our recruiters have the benefit through prior interviews, through prior work experience with our clients of that feedback that you're never going to get no matter how good social media gets. Further, social media's success is not a 0-sum game with recruiting agencies. Remember, recruiting agency-assisted placements are about 9% to 10% of the jobs filled in the United States. So a success on a social media site does not translate to the detriment of recruiting agencies on a one-for-one basis. And finally, I'll stop where I started to say, our middle market clients essentially outsource recruiting to us on a no-risk contingency basis rather than carrying more fixed internal cost of recruiters."

There's not much to add. I would mention that with respect to the temporary business, Keith referred to coemployment risks, you might remember that Microsoft made over $100 million in damages when they attempted to manage their own temp pool. They got in trouble with the IRS and that all sorts of other legal issues. I think surveys of HR managers will convince you that the company's large, small and in between, there's no desire to try to manage their own temp pools. And you'll find that virtually, almost no temps are recruited via social networking sites. Again, I think there's also a misunderstanding about the percentage of our net income that comes from our permanent job business. As Keith noted, it's more like 13%. I've talked to some investors, I think it's half and so forth. But I think Keith laid out the case pretty well. I -- my personal opinion as you'll continue to see our permanent job business do very, very well, and you'll find that just as the job boards didn't seem to hurt us nor do have the social networking sites and in fact, they're probably helping us."

If you remember in the second quarter, there was a consistent deceleration such that we grew 13% during the quarter and then post quarter, it dropped down to 8%. In the third quarter, we dropped down somewhat in July. It's been consistent thereafter such that for the third quarter, we've reported 8% and we're out of the gate at 7%, roughly the same number. So we do feel that the trends are solid as we speak. Clients have gotten a little more cautious. It is a modestly tougher market condition. There is economic uncertainty that's impacting our clients. But that said, the intro quarter trends and post quarter are better this quarter than they were a quarter ago."

Now let's discuss the third quarter. Global revenues for the third quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2011 on a same-day constant currency basis. Income per share was $0.41, up 33% from the third quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $76 million. Capital expenditures were $12 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the third quarter at a cost of $27 million. In August, our board authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to an additional 10 million shares of the company's common stock. There are approximately 12.6 million shares still available under this board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with the company's operating performance during the third quarter. For the ninth consecutive quarter, U.S. staffing revenues  saw double-digit year-over-year growth rates. In addition, global operating income grew by 31% with higher gross margins, lower selling, general and administrative expense ratios and strong Protiviti results.
Now turning the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results."

As you noted, third quarter revenues were $1.03 billion, a reported increase of 5% over last year. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 8% year-over-year with the U.S. growing by 12% and international locations declining 1% on this basis.
U.S. staffing revenues were $674 million on the third quarter, while international staffing revenues were $240 million. We have 351 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. We calculated 63.3 billing days in the third quarter compared to 64.1 days in last year's third quarter, the effect of which was a 1.3% reduction in year-over-year staffing growth rates in the third quarter. The current fourth quarter has 62 billing days. Currency exchange rates reduced third quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and third quarter year-over-year revenues by $19 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2% in the third quarter.
Earlier this year, we began providing a supplemental schedule with our earnings results. The supplemental schedule is a non-GAAP financial measure that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as same-day constant currency basis. It further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today's press release and in the investor center of our website.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $119 million, including $93 million in the U.S. and $26 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 8% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue remaining flat. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. Now let's look at gross margin.
Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.2% of applicable revenues. This was a 70 basis point increase over the third quarter of last year and a 40 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2012. The improvements reflect continued strength in pay bill spreads, modestly lower fringe benefit costs, which more than offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion fees. Permanent placement revenue was 8.9% of staffing revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than the 9% of revenue from 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus 1 year ago. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $32 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues compared to $30 million or 27.5% of revenues a year ago.
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost, in the third quarter, our staffing SG&A's cost were 32.3% of staffing revenues, down 120 basis points from the 33.5% reported a year ago.  Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 22% of revenues. This is a 260 basis point improvement from the 24.6% level reported last year. 
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $88 million or 9.7% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $76 million in operating income for the quarter or 9.1% of applicable revenues.
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $12 million or 15.3% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $6 million for the quarter or 5% of revenues compared to $3 million in the third quarter a year ago or 3% of revenues. Accounts receivable were $557 million at the end of the third quarter, with implied days outstanding of 49 days compared to 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter 2011.
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated in July, then remained fairly constant in August and September. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement division decelerated in July, but reaccelerated in August and September. Outside the U.S., our year-over-year growth rates decelerated throughout the quarter, turning negative in August and September.
During the first week of October, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 7% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 2 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues were up 36% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would again caution that it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.
Taking all of this information into account, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.38 to $0.43. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risk mentioned in today's press release, consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Year-over-year growth rates for the staffing business in Protiviti remain solid during the quarter, particularly in the United States. International operations were impacted by continued economic uncertainty in parts of Europe. We have limited exposure in the hardest hit European countries, but the debt crisis resulted in a more cautious business climate overall, which did affect international operations. As we noted on last quarter's call, we are taking proactive steps to reduce our non-U.S. operating cost.
Taking a look at Protiviti, as noted earlier, we were pleased to see solid year-over-year growth in this business, as was the case with our staffing divisions, growth in U.S. operations was largely responsible for the strong results. Information technology consulting and financial services risk and compliance services remain 2 of the fastest-growing business segments for Protiviti's services. In our staffing operations, our U.S. offices are seeing rising demand for professional staffing and consulting services. This was evidenced by solid growth rates for account temps in Robert Half Management Resources during the quarter. Demand for flexible staffing solutions also has remained strong. Temporary and contingent workers now make up 1.9% of total U.S. non-perm employment, up from a low of 1.34% in June 2009. Current penetration rates are approaching the all-time high level of 2% in April 2000, notwithstanding the high current U.S. unemployment rates. That U.S. unemployment rate declined from 8.1% to 7.8% in September. The unemployment rate for skilled college degree workers, which is our sweet spot, remains at approximately 1/2 that rate. 
This underscores the dual job market we have referenced many times. Our clients are facing candidate shortages in many of the field in which we specialize. Helping them to hire this hard-to-find talent is what we do. Our professionals have both the time and expertise it takes for personal interviews, technical skills evaluations, reference checks, soft skills assessments and finally, making the best match with the company's unique culture. We do bring the clients a unique insight into candidate skills and personality fit gained through our proprietary testing processes, direct interaction with the people we place and most important, direct client feedback. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] If time permits, as usual, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call."

First of all, if you look country by country, we still had very strong numbers in Germany that were up solid double digits. We were up year-over-year in Australia. The other European and other global markets did have negative year-over-year growth rates, which were expected. As we talked about last quarter, we have -- more intently focused on our SG&A cost outside the U.S. They again did a very good job matching their cost structure with their revenues. We would expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. We are reducing headcount where the revenues dictate by the same token we are investing headcount in the countries where that makes sense, principally Germany. Regarding perm revenue expectations for Q4 internationally, understand that unlike Q3 where the August holidays have an impact disproportionately on perm non-U.S., you have a longer quarter in the fourth quarter. That said, there's always uncertainty about December with clients running out of hiring authority from a budget standpoint. If you look historically, perm, globally, U.S. and non-U.S., in the fourth quarter, is flattish to slightly down sequentially with the third, and our guidance wouldn't be that different. This issue around disintermediation, client size, et cetera, so I'll get to the clients -- the easy part first, is our client size, in our sweet spot, is 75 to 100 employees. That client group, for the most part, chooses not to have the fixed cost of carrying their own recruiters and instead, outsources that to us on a risk-free contingency basis. And the social media opportunities of the last few years haven't really changed that. But let me back up a little and just to make sure we level set and everybody's talking about the same information, first of all, with respect to our temporary and consulting divisions, which are 80% of our consolidated operating income, understand that very few companies, regardless of size, want to recruit and manage their own temporary pools, which is very labor-intensive. A large motivation there is they don't want the co-employment risk. They don't want to worry about whether the temporaries have to or would qualify for their various benefit plans. Further, it's very, as I said, labor-intensive to manage temporary pools. Further, these social media sites are primarily catering to passive candidates that already have a job. For the most part, passive candidates who already have a job overwhelmingly are not willing to consider temporary assignments. Further, digital candidate databases for active job seekers, which are relevant to our temporary business, have been around for more than 10 years, i.e. the job boards. And we've coexisted just fine. I would further say that there is actually a net positive to our temporary and consulting divisions and that our temporary recruiters do use social media for client development and do use social media for candidate referrals. So now let's move to the impact to our permanent placement division. I would first, from a context standpoint, set forth that our permanent placement operating income is about 13% of our consolidated total. I would further say that candidate identification is a small portion of the full placement process. There's a long lead time involved to convert a passive candidate into a newly hired employee. The full placement process is very time-consuming. You must engage, you must interview, you must evaluate hard and soft skills, you must match, all of which Max talked about earlier. Further, we would say that there is some  diseconomies of scale and that the better candidates are already being bombarded with solicitations from recruiters to the extent more recruiters use social media that better candidates are going to get further bombarded, meaning, they're less likely to respond. We would further observe that this huge pool of passive candidates through a recruiter, in many cases, are tire kickers. They love to hear about all of the possible job opportunities available to them, but frankly, they're not willing to change jobs, again, making the full placement process even more time-consuming. The majority of our candidates still come from referrals, not social media, still come from RHI's internal databases and our other traditional sources. Our recruiters, which we believe are some of the best on the planet, have unique insights into candidates through testing, through client evaluations. You're never going to get client feedback on a social media site. Our recruiters have the benefit through prior interviews, through prior work experience with our clients of that feedback that you're never going to get no matter how good social media gets. Further, social media's success is not a zero-sum game with recruiting agencies. Remember, recruiting agency-assisted placements are about 9% to 10% of the jobs filled in the United States. So a success on a social media site does not translate to the detriment of recruiting agencies on a one-for-one basis. And finally, I'll stop where I started to say, our middle market clients essentially outsource recruiting to us on a no-risk contingency basis rather than carrying more fixed internal cost of recruiters."

There's not a whole lot to add. I would mention that with respect to the temporary business, when Keith referred to co-employment risks, you might remember that Microsoft paid over $100 million in damages when they attempted to manage their own temp pool. They got in trouble with the IRS and that all sorts of other legal issues. I think the surveys of HR managers will convince you that at companies large, small and in between, there is no desire to try to manage their own temp pools. And you'll find that virtually almost no temps are recruited via social networking sites. Again, I think there's also a misunderstanding about the percentage of our net income that comes from our permanent job business. As Keith noted, it's more like 13%. I've talked to some investors, I think it's half and so forth. But I think Keith laid out the case pretty well. I -- my personal opinion, as you'll continue to see, our permanent job business do very, very well. And you'll find that just as the job boards didn't seem to hurt us, nor have the social networking sites. And in fact, they're probably helping us."

So good, solid quarter for Protiviti. The fourth quarter, because of the holiday impact, which is somewhat greater in Protiviti than for staffing, where many of its clients take the entire period between Christmas and New Year's, there's typically a larger fourth quarter holiday impact for Protiviti.

Now let's discuss the third quarter. Global revenues for the third quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2011 on a same-day constant currency basis. Income per share was $0.41, up 33% from the third quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $76 million. Capital expenditures were $12 million. We paid our stockholders a cash dividend of $0.15 per share at a cost of $21 million. We also repurchased 1 million RHI shares during the third quarter at a cost of $27 million. In August, our board authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to an additional 10 million shares of the company's common stock. There are approximately 12.6 million shares still available under this board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with the company's operating performance during the third quarter. For the ninth consecutive quarter, U.S. staffing revenues saw double-digit year-over-year growth rates. In addition, global operating income grew by 31% with higher gross margins, lower selling, general and administrative expense ratios and strong Protiviti results.
Now turning the call over to Keith Waddell for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results."

As you noted, third quarter revenues were $1.03 billion, a reported increase of 5% over last year. On a same-day constant currency basis, global staffing revenues increased 8% year-over-year with the U.S. growing by 12% and international locations declining 1% on this basis.
U.S. staffing revenues were $674 million on the third quarter, while international staffing revenues were $240 million. We have 351 staffing locations worldwide, including 103 locations in 19 countries outside the U.S. We calculated 63.3 billing days in the third quarter compared to 64.1 days in last year's third quarter, the effect of which was a 1.3% reduction in year-over-year staffing growth rates in the third quarter. The current fourth quarter has 62 billing days. Currency exchange rates reduced third quarter 2012 sequential revenues by $1 million and third quarter year-over-year revenues by $19 million. This had the effect of reducing year-over-year staffing growth rates by 2% in the third quarter.
Earlier this year, we began providing a supplemental schedule with our earnings results. The supplemental schedule is a non-GAAP financial measure that shows year-over-year revenue growth rates for each of our staffing lines of business on a reported basis, as well as same-day constant currency basis. It further divides the data between U.S. and non-U.S. operations. You can find the schedule in today's press release and in the investor center of our website.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $119 million, including $93 million in the U.S. and $26 million outside the U.S. Year-over-year growth rates were 8% globally, with U.S. revenue up 10% and non-U.S. revenue remaining flat. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 71 locations in 22 countries. Now let's look at gross margin.
Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 36.2% of applicable revenues. This was a 70-basis point increase over the third quarter of last year and a 40-basis point increase from the second quarter of 2012. The improvements reflect continued strength in pay bill spreads, modestly lower fringe benefit costs, which more than offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion fees. Permanent placement revenue was 8.9% of staffing revenue for the quarter, slightly lower than the 9% of revenue from 1 year ago. Together with the higher temporary and consulting gross margins, overall staffing gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus 1 year ago. Protiviti's third quarter gross margin was $32 million or 26.9% of Protiviti revenues compared to $30 million or 27.5% of revenues a year ago.
Turning to selling, general and administrative cost, in the third quarter, our staffing SG&A's cost were 32.3% of staffing revenues, down 120 basis points from the 33.5% reported a year ago. Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 22% of revenues. This is a 260 basis point improvement from the 24.6% level reported last year. 
Third quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $88 million or 9.7% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions reported $76 million in operating income for the quarter or 9.1% of applicable revenues.
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $12 million or 15.3% of applicable revenues. Protiviti's operating profit was $6 million for the quarter or 5% of revenues compared to $3 million in the third quarter a year ago or 3% of revenues. Accounts receivable were $557 million at the end of the third quarter, with implied days outstanding of 49 days compared to 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter 2011.
Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. We saw the following trends in the third quarter and the first few weeks of October. In the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our temporary and consulting divisions decelerated in July, then remained fairly constant in August and September. Also in the U.S., year-over-year growth rates for our permanent placement division decelerated in July, but reaccelerated in August and September. Outside the U.S., our year-over-year growth rates decelerated throughout the quarter, turning negative in August and September.
During the first week of October, revenues for our temporary and consulting businesses were up 7% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. For the first 2 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues were up 36% on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the same period last year. We would again caution that it's difficult to evaluate trends over such short time periods.
Taking all of this information into account, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1.01 billion to $1.06 billion; income per share, $0.38 to $0.43. It's our policy to limit guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risk mentioned in today's press release. Consistent with prior quarters, our guidance does not include any additional amounts for the settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Year-over-year growth rates for the staffing business in Protiviti remained solid during the quarter, particularly in the United States. International operations were impacted by continued economic uncertainty in parts of Europe. We have limited exposure in the hardest hit European countries, but the debt crisis resulted in a more cautious business climate overall, which did affect international operations. As we noted on last quarter's call, we are taking proactive steps to reduce our non-U.S. operating cost.
Taking a look at Protiviti, as noted earlier, we were pleased to see solid year-over-year growth in this business. As was the case with our staffing divisions, growth in U.S. operations was largely responsible for the strong results. Information technology consulting and financial services risk and compliance services remain 2 of the fastest-growing business segments for Protiviti's services. In our staffing operations, our U.S. offices are seeing rising demand for professional staffing and consulting services. This was evidenced by solid growth rates for account temps in Robert Half Management Resources during the quarter. Demand for flexible staffing solutions also has remained strong. Temporary and contingent workers now make up 1.9% of total U.S. non-farm employment, up from a low of 1.34% in June 2009. Current penetration rates are approaching the all-time high level of 2% in April 2000, notwithstanding the high current U.S. unemployment rates. That U.S. unemployment rate declined from 8.1% to 7.8% in September. The unemployment rate for skilled college degree workers, which is our sweet spot, remains at approximately 1/2 that rate. 
This underscores the dual job market we have referenced many times. Our clients are facing candidate shortages in many of the fields in which we specialize. Helping them to hire this hard-to-find talent is what we do. Our professionals have both the time and expertise it takes for personal interviews, technical skills evaluations, reference checks, soft skills assessments and finally, making the best match with a company's unique culture. We do bring the clients a unique insight into candidate skills and personality fit gained through our proprietary testing processes, direct interaction with the people we place and most important, direct client feedback. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] If time permits, as usual, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call."

Can you talk a little bit about -- obviously, I think most of the people on this call are aware of that one report that came out from somebody who doesn't follow the industry about potential disintermediation. Can you talk just a little bit about the client profile that you have, particularly on the perm side on both domestically and international just in terms of the size of those clients, and how likely it would be that they might disintermediate you?"

First of all, if you look country by country, we still had very strong numbers in Germany that were up solid double digits. We were up year-over-year in Australia. The other European and other global markets did have negative year-over-year growth rates, which were expected. As we talked about last quarter, we have more intently focused on our SG&A cost outside the U.S. They again did a very good job matching their cost structure with their revenues. We would expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. We are reducing headcount where the revenues dictate. By the same token we are investing headcount in the countries where that makes sense, principally Germany. Regarding perm revenue expectations for Q4 internationally, understand that unlike Q3 where the August holidays have an impact disproportionately on perm non-U.S., you have a longer quarter in the fourth quarter. That said, there's always uncertainty about December with clients running out of hiring authority from a budget standpoint. If you look historically, perm, globally, U.S. and non-U.S., in the fourth quarter, is flattish to slightly down sequentially with the third, and our guidance wouldn't be that different. This issue around disintermediation, client size, et cetera, so I'll get to the clients -- the easy part first, is our client size, in our sweet spot, is 75 to 100 employees. That client group, for the most part, chooses not to have the fixed cost of carrying their own recruiters and instead, outsources that to us on a risk-free contingency basis. And the social media opportunities of the last few years haven't really changed that. But let me back up a little and just to make sure we level set and everybody's talking about the same information, first of all, with respect to our temporary and consulting divisions, which are 80% of our consolidated operating income, understand that very few companies, regardless of size, want to recruit and manage their own temporary pools, which is very labor-intensive. A large motivation there is they don't want the co-employment risk. They don't want to worry about whether the temporaries have to or would qualify for their various benefit plans. Further, it's very, as I said, labor-intensive to manage temporary pools. Further, these social media sites are primarily catering to passive candidates that already have a job. For the most part, passive candidates who already have a job overwhelmingly are not willing to consider temporary assignments. Further, digital candidate databases for active job seekers, which are relevant to our temporary business, have been around for more than 10 years, i.e. the job boards. And we've coexisted just fine. I would further say that there is actually a net positive to our temporary and consulting divisions in that our temporary recruiters do use social media for client development and do use social media for candidate referrals. So now let's move to the impact to our permanent placement division. I would first, from a context standpoint, set forth that our permanent placement operating income is about 13% of our consolidated total. I would further say that candidate identification is a small portion of the full placement process. There's a long lead time involved to convert a passive candidate into a newly hired employee. The full placement process is very time-consuming. You must engage, you must interview, you must evaluate hard and soft skills, you must match, all of which Max talked about earlier. Further, we would say that there is some diseconomies of scale in that the better candidates are already being bombarded with solicitations from recruiters. To the extent more recruiters use social media, the better candidates are going to get further bombarded, meaning they're less likely to respond. We would further observe that this huge pool of passive candidates to a recruiter, in many cases, are tire kickers. They love to hear about all of the possible job opportunities available to them, but frankly, they're not willing to change jobs, again, making the full placement process even more time-consuming. The majority of our candidates still come from referrals, not social media, still come from RHI's internal databases and our other traditional sources. Our recruiters, which we believe are some of the best on the planet, have unique insights into candidates through testing, through client evaluations. You're never going to get client feedback on a social media site. Our recruiters have the benefit through prior interviews, through prior work experience with our clients of that feedback that you're never going to get no matter how good social media gets. Further, social media's success is not a zero-sum game with recruiting agencies. Remember, recruiting agency-assisted placements are about 9% to 10% of the jobs filled in the United States. So a success on a social media site does not translate to the detriment of recruiting agencies on a one-for-one basis. And finally, I'll stop where I started to say, our middle market clients essentially outsource recruiting to us on a no-risk contingency basis rather than carrying more fixed internal cost of recruiters."

There's not a whole lot to add. I would mention that with respect to the temporary business, when Keith referred to co-employment risks, you might remember that Microsoft paid over $100 million in damages when they attempted to manage their own temp pool. They got in trouble with the IRS and had all sorts of other legal issues. I think surveys of HR managers will convince you that at companies large, small and in between, there's no desire to try to manage their own temp pools. And you'll find that virtually almost no temps are recruited via social networking sites. Again, I think there's also a misunderstanding about the percentage of our net income that comes from our permanent job business. As Keith noted, it's more like 13%. I've talked to some investors that think it's half and so forth. But I think Keith laid out the case pretty well. I -- my personal opinion is you'll continue to see our permanent job business do very, very well. And you'll find that just as the job boards didn't seem to hurt us, nor have the social networking sites. And in fact, they're probably helping us."

We were quite pleased with how it's gone with internal audit, with financial services risk and compliance and with IT, security and asset management. So it's the same solutions that we focused on now for some quarter, performed quite well during this quarter. In addition, we've gotten more and more traction going to market together with our staffing divisions where Protiviti manages the project for the client and many of the arms and legs are provided by our staffing division consultants. So good, solid quarter for Protiviti. The fourth quarter, because of the holiday impact, which is somewhat greater in Protiviti than for staffing, where many of its clients take the entire period between Christmas and New Year's, there's typically a larger fourth quarter holiday impact for Protiviti. And that usually shows up in slightly lower sequential revenues. But year-over-year, we still feel good, and Protiviti is very optimistic."

If you remember, in the second quarter, there was a consistent deceleration such that we grew 13% during the quarter, and then post quarter, it dropped down to 8%. In the third quarter, we dropped down somewhat in July. It's been consistent thereafter such that for the third quarter, we've reported 8% growth, and we're out of the gate at 7%, roughly the same number.
