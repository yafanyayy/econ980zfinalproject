Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%. And adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million",2064,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%. And adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million of free cash flow and over $1 billion in available cash. These results and our long-term earnings and cash flow outlook give us confidence to raise our dividend by 53%. This increase is consistent with our policy of growing our dividend at least at the rate of growth of our business. 
During 2011, we repurchased 17% of our outstanding shares for $902 million, buying 28.7 million shares at an average price of $31.45. Since our launch as a public company in August 2006, we have repurchased 65 million shares for $2 billion at an average price of just under $31. Operationally, we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives throughout our company. At Wyndham Hotel Group, Apollo, our series of initiatives aimed at improving our value proposition to our hotel owners is well underway and we are seeing measurable success, which I will discuss in a moment. At Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, our RCI team delivered yet another series of technology upgrades to our web capability, increasing customer satisfaction, online share and operating margins. We also made significant progress growing our North American rentals platform with the integration of ResortQuest exceeding our expectations. And we continue to achieve record efficiency levels at Wyndham Vacation Ownership with margins up over 250 basis points and an EBITDA increase of 17% for the year. 
Before going into 2001 results, let me spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the economy and within our sector. Despite many macro twists and turns in 2011, the geographic and demographic diversity of our businesses and the resiliency of our fee-for-service business models provide a stable base for us to grow. We expect that also to be the case in 2012. In 2011, hotel industry demand hit an new all-time high with more room nights sold than ever before. However, rates charged for hotel rooms have not recovered to pre-2009 levels. The net is that RevPAR improved during 2011 and we believe this positive trend should continue in 2012. 
According to a study conducted by Atmosphere Research Group in October, while only 29% of U.S. travelers favorably viewed their 2011 financial condition, 43% believe their finances will be better in 2012. And travelers who expect their finances to improve outnumber those who are pessimistic about their finances by more than 2 to 1. Most travelers expect to take the same number of trips, which is 7 on average, in 2012 as they did in 2011. They also expect to spend about the same amount of money on travels last year, which is about $3,200. This is consistent with the continuing, gradual recovery we foresee in our U.S. businesses, which contribute nearly 70% of our EBITDA. In the hotel group, we finished 2011 ahead of expectations and we expect a strong 2012 with RevPAR increases of 5% to 8%. In our Exchange and Rentals business, 2011 was our first full year with ResortQuest and North American vacation rentals business. This business is running ahead of our plans with great momentum carrying in to 2012. RCI held its first -- excuse me, it's annual affiliate event in New York last month. The record attendance indicates that interest among timeshare developers is strong and growing. New sources of financing for the overall timeshare industry are still involving and the mood was more optimistic than I've seen in a long time. And of course our own timeshare business continues to exceed expectations. Despite some significant dips in consumer confidence during the year, our timeshare owners continue to demonstrate the value they place on vacations with arrivals at our resorts reaching an all-time high. In our sales force demonstrated its ability to sell the product as volume per guest also reached all-time highs. So in the U.S., we expect to see a continuing gradual improvement in the economy. 
In Europe, however, where the majority of our vacation rental businesses are based, the economic climate remains challenging and the future uncertain. In this region, which is about 15% of our EBITDA, we continue to see the shortening of booking windows and pressure on yields as customers become increasingly value focused. Despite these challenges, the strong value proposition of our products and the strength of our established local brands lead us to expect that our European Rentals business will remain stable in 2012. 
Against this economic backdrop, we continue to focus on 2 areas to increase shareholder revenue. The first is a focus on execution. That means in turn we execute to capture more than our fair share of the U.S. economy recover. We expect our domestic RevPAR, for example, gains to be ahead of the industry. Great execution also means taking steps to mitigate the impact of a potential economic downturn in Europe. As always, we'll be disciplined in discretionary spending and we'll continue to invest in our resilient fee-for-service businesses. 
One final comment on execution is that we have strong operating plans that leverage our competitive advantages and we are adaptable to changing conditions. We've proven our ability to operate in difficult conditions over the last 5 years and we expect nothing less in 2012. The second area of focuses is capital allocation. In 2011 we returned $1 billion of available cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have a well established capital allocation plan, which includes investing in our businesses through acquisitions, paying dividends and share repurchases, and we will continue to execute against that framework. Tom will discuss this more in detail later.
Now let's take a look at our business units in more detail. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make great progress in executing its online strategy as part of its Apollo initiatives. Online bookings are growing portion of the hotel reservation process and now accounts for about 1/3 total hotel and lodging industry revenue. Study shows consumers are spending on an increasing amount of time shopping and compare hotel option online. Often visiting between 8 to 15 different websites to make an informed decision. Our goal is to capture a maximum amount of that traffic and to ensure that page views result in booking clickthroughs or conversions. We've developed a comprehensive multifaceted plan to drive more room nights to our hotels through our online direct distribution channels. The launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first steps. Most of our brand websites have now been updated. Results are excellent with conversion rates up on average 20%. 
In December, we piloted Trip Advisers ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to half of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review making ratings and reviews readily available on our own sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information. Initial results of the pilot are positive. We plan on adding trip advisor ratings to all our brand websites in 2012. We've also launched an umbrella cross brand umbrella, wyndhamhotelgroup.com, which is designed to aggregate traffic and provide a vehicle to attract customers who are looking to shop all of our brands on one site. These efforts are supported by another initiative under our direct strategy, our investment along with 5 other hotel companies in roomkey.com. We believe roomkey.com will provide consumers with the trustworthy and uncluttered way to compare and book hotels through superior hotel shopping experience, while driving bookings directly to our own online channels. Roomkey.com provides a new cost effective channel for our owners and will better meet the needs of consumers who currently shop across multiple sites before booking. 
Wyndham Hotel Group will be rolling out additional initiatives over the course of the year including new mobile sites and apps all designed to drive more online businesses and develop a more profitable channel mix for the owners of our hotels. Of course, we have had much success in driving online transactions within our Wyndham Exchange and Rentals unit while over the course of 3 years we have built the best online timeshare exchange and club servicing platform in the industry. We are pleased with the results of our latest rci.com enhancements introduced in October. As we explained previously, this release included several major milestones such as improved search functionalities, points members and the innovative recommendation engine will provides proactive travel recommendations to members based on their individual preferences. The results since launch have been measurable with favorable feedback from users and increases in points transactions and web share. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 7% increase in points transactions and we continue to see the resulting improved efficiency in our exchange operations with online transactions share growing to 39% in the fourth quarter, compared to 30% in last year's fourth quarter and 13% when we started the project. 
On the rental side, we made great progress in growing our North American rental business in the fourth quarter by integrating 2 acquisitions in key Colorado and Florida markets. ResortQuest finished off a great 2011 meeting revenue goals and exceeding earnings expectations by capitalizing on the operating synergies within Wyndham Worldwide. In 2012, we expect continued growth in our North American rental business with additional synergies expected to drive improved efficiency and growth in earnings. In addition to organic growth, we hope to add to this business through select acquisitions in 2012.
We're also pleased with the performance of our vacation rental businesses in Europe. As you know we have many well-established brands with loyal customer bases across the U.K., Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Despite the challenging conditions, our businesses remain stable. We expect the same for the upcoming year as Europeans continue to look to vacation rentals as a great value and our product is located where they want to vacation.
Finally, turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another great year, generating over $500 million in EBITDA. The businesses outperformed our expectations every quarter since we rightsized the business in late 2008. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team is continued to refine its business model to support our corporate focus on fee-for-service businesses that generate significant free cash flow. The first step was establishing Wyndham asset affiliation model, or WAAM, which offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks holding newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced what we call WAAM 2.0, where we sold not only the inventory, but also offer consumer loans. WAAM 2.0 has continued to evolve. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capitalized operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal in December 2011 and expect to start sales in the third quarter of 2012.
Last quarter, I spoke of a new marketing initiative on our timeshare business which enables us to better target new buyers. As you know, new owner acquisition is an important strategy for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It's critical that we maintain a healthy pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership as new owners drive upgrade sales in the future. I'm pleased to report that during 2011 we added approximately 27,000 new owners exceeding our goal. We expect continued strength in 2012 as we remain focused on generating high quality tours and improving our already high efficiencies. 
In summary, 2011 was a strong year across the board and I'm excited about 2012 and our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to comment on Count On Me culture at Wyndham Worldwide. We just received results from our biannual employee survey. Our employee engagement scores ranked with best in class companies. This indicates that Wyndham Associates are committed, loyal and proud. They have a strong sense of personal responsibility in delivering a great experience for our customers and great results for the company. And while it's gratifying to see those survey results, I wasn't surprised because I see the real proof ever day and the actions of our associates in every quarter and our results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus of the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me add to Steve's comments that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good no",2272,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to focus of the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me add to Steve's comments that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good now. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong business unit execution and our ongoing commitment to focus generating cash and making smart capital allocation decisions. We came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range reflecting the impact of the fourth quarter share repurchases, as well as lower interest expense, D&A and taxes. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA which excludes the impact of $44 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the lodging business, was flat compared to the same period of 2010, and slightly better than our expectations. Remember that we had expected quarter for EBITDA to be down year-over-year reflecting among other factors the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs, unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs at the Hotel Group and increased information security costs at corporate. 
Free cash flow increased to $754 million for the full year. Now excluding the one time VAT refund and related interest income of $67 million, free cash flow normalized to $687 million for the year. As you know, I have said often that cash is a great enabler. We will use our significant free cash flow to support growth and build shareholder value. This will enable us to invest in the business including acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We expect the deployment of cash flow, combined with the organic growth of our businesses to generate annual earnings per share growth approximating 20% per year over the next 5 years. 
As Steve noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which is a 32% payout at the midpoint of our 2012 net income guidance range. In addition, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter, spending $225 million. In 2012 to market closed last evening, we purchased an additional 1.5 million shares for a total of $60 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. 
Now, moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with our Hotel Group. Revenues were up 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Now a portion of that increase reflects the reporting reclassification of $15 million, which had no impact on EBITDA. Excluding reclassifications, revenues were up 6% reflecting improved domestic RevPAR and incremental revenues from our newly opened Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. 
As mentioned earlier, we had non-cash write offs at the Hotel Group in the fourth quarter. Let me take a minute to walk you through the components of this non-cash charge. First, when we repurchase -- when we purchased the Wyndham brand in 2005 we allocated a portion of the purchase price to approximately 60 of the existing franchise and management contracts creating an intangible asset on the balance sheet. The brand has evolved over the past 6 years and many of those original contracts are no longer the system. As a result, we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately $14 million. We now have 100 hotels in the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand and nearly 70% are new flags since acquisition.
Second, we have determined that we are unlikely to realize expected returns from investments at 3 managed property and we believe the prudent course is to write down the investments by approximately $30 million. These investments made at the height of the market were primarily related to development advances and management agreements. Now again, these are non-cash asset impairments. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by the unfavorable timing of marketing cost, which we described in our third quarter call. RevPAR recovery continued in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, systemwide RevPAR increased 5%. Now in the U.S. fourth quarter RevPAR improvement 8.4% versus a year ago, reflecting improvements in both occupancy and rate.
International RevPAR was down 3% due primarily to the rapid growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and some softness in Europe. We ended the year with 613,100 rooms in the system. Excluding the Carinthia and Ramada U.K. terminations, which we disclosed in the previous quarters, the system size increased by 1%. The pipeline sit at nearly 112,000 rooms at December 31, 2011, down slightly sequentially reflecting strong room openings of close to 15,000 in quarter 4.
For the full year, contract signings were up 15% compared with 2010 and we executed 399 conversion deals compared with 363 deals in 2010, about a 10% increase.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals did a great job of delivering their financial results despite FX headwinds and a difficult economic environment in Europe. Total revenue in constant currency was up 4% in the fourth quarter reflecting acquisitions, which contributed $14 million in incremental revenues. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of acquisitions in foreign currency. The impact of the acquisitions of vacation rental businesses, which have seasonally light sales in the fourth quarter, exacerbated quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Reflecting negative foreign exchange impact, exchange revenues decreased by 2% in the quarter. The average number of members was flat. In constant currency, exchange revenue and exchange revenue per member were also flat. 
Vacation rental revenues increased 10% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, vacation rental revenue was flat with average net price per rental up 5%, and vacation rental transactions down 5%. This reflects active yield management offset by volume declines at our Dutch and U.K. businesses consistent with the lower consumer confidence in those regions.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues in the one in the fourth quarter of 2011 both increased 6% with up 8% and volume per guest up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. We also benefited from higher WAAM conditions. We made good progress in expanding our pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. In 2011, we welcomed 27,000 new WV owners to the Wyndham family, that's a 23% increase compared with 2010 and has exceeded our goal for the year. Our property management business continued to contribute predictable, recurring fee-for-service revenues in 2011 producing $56 million of EBITDA. Consumer finance revenues in the quarter were down slightly reflecting the decrease in our contract receivable portfolio. And interest expense was flat. 
Looking at portfolio performance, delinquency and default rates were flat. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was flat and write-offs during the fourth quarter were $75 million. As Steve mentioned, we signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal. Now, the accounting for these transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet on a just in time basis. We'll record the inventory in the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transactions. Going forward, we will refer to this type of deal as WAAM just-in-time. This arrangement will enable us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. 
Now moving to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, corporate expenses were higher primarily reflecting increased data security and higher employee related costs. Now let's turn to our 2012 guidance. We're going to post full guidance details including cash flow to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the highlights, revenue guidance remains at our $4.4 billion  to $4.6 billion, up 4% to 8% at 2011, and EBITDA guidance remains at $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 up 6% to 8% from 2011. Because of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2012 to $2.85 to $3 with a diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares which assumes no additional share repurchases in 2012.
Those ranges translate to approximately 18% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56 per share. Now please note that cash flow and share repurchase continue to be an important part of our investment thesis. We have considered whether to include share repurchase in our guidance assumptions. We've decided to adhere to our current practice of not doing so to allow for investment in our business, including acquisitions when opportunities present themselves. We view share repurchases as an attractive opportunity as well, of course, which we will weigh against M&A opportunities in our capital allocation decision process.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance at each of our business units, starting with the Hotel Group. This year, our growth expectations for the lodging business reflect, in part, our decision to charge a higher licensing fee to our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand, which we believe has been of tremendous benefit to our timeshare business over the past few years. Additionally, we expect increased contributions from our recently completed Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. Excluding these new items, the normalized EBITDA growth rate for the Hotel Group in 2012 would be 8% to 10%. In addition, we expect RevPAR to be up by 5% to 8%, and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be $835 million to $875 million and EBITDA in the range of $260 million and $270 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. In exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat to down 2% primarily reflecting the loss of an affiliate with approximately 60,000 members. This affiliate's requests resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. We expect exchange revenue per member to be flat to up 2% reflecting higher transaction pricing in other number related revenue, offset by negative currency impacts.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 4% to 7% and average net price per vacation rentals to be flat-to-down 3% reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.44 billion to $1.51 billion, and EBITDA of $335 million to $355 million. Note that our growth expectations in Exchange and Rentals continues to be mid-single digits through 2015. The 2012 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange headwinds and the macroenvironment challenges in Europe. 
Finally moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect gross DOI sales to be up slightly from 2011 to $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, which includes approximately $120 million in gross WAAM sales. A 1% to 4% increase in tourists as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of $2.15 billion to $2.225 billion and EBITDA of $515 million to $540 million. Excluding the increased licensing fee to the Hotel Group, we expect to normalized growth rate at vacation ownership in the mid-single digits.
Based on the improvements we've made the credit standards and the performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline this year to $315 million to $335 million. Regarding our outlook for the ABS markets, 2011, of course, was our best year ever. We were able to obtain an average advance rate of 95% based on the quality of our portfolio and favorable market conditions. Each of our deal included a BB. Going forward you may choose not to ask us to be BB the market for each one of the deal due to higher cost to secure investor demand. Accordingly, we expect 2012 advance rates to normalize in the high 80s.
We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $93 million to $100 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information security and IT in general. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $185 million to $190 million, somewhat higher than 2011 reflecting the opening of our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and technology investments. We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $140 million, Now remember our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means our goal would be to add debt as we add EBITDA. Our interest expense guidance assumes our current debt profile. Any additional debt will incur, of course, additional interest expense and we'll update our guidance when and if appropriate. 
We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 38% consistent with 2011. We also expect to spend $195 million to $210 million in CapEx. This is slightly higher than our 5-year plan baseline which is about $180 million to $200 million. We expect to get back to those levels in the next year or so. We expect to spend between $110 million and $120 million in timeshare development in 2012, up from the $80 million we disclosed in 2011. And closer to our projection of $150 million average over the 5-year period starting in 2011.
Based on our current forecast we expect free cash flow to be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With financing activities, we expect that 2012 available cash could be close to $1 billion. We will use that additional cash, of course, to invest in the business including M&A and the return to shareholders through additional share repurchase. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

First of all, the initiatives that we've put in place over the last several years, these Apollo initiatives that we talked about, are really starting to kick in now. Our websites have been upgraded and they needed to be updated and they've been updated. And some of the other online initiatives will continue to drive traffic through those websites and we hope to convert and capture more. So I think that is one element of helping. The other element helping is our mix. As we add more Wyndham product, which we have a very good pipeline of, that Wyndham product comes at a higher RevPAR, so just the general mix of us should lift us above the average if you look at our component pieces. So that's really the reason for the RevPAR, what we think will be an outpaced RevPAR performance. And we've been doing very well in our online efforts. With respect to WAAM 2.0, or WAAM just in time, that is a relatively manageable number for us as we've told you in the past. We try to balance taking off of our balance sheet product, as well as taking advantage of market place that's attractive right now. Do we think it could be more than 15%? Over time, Joe, it definitely could be. The reception for this WAAM product that we're providing has been very strong from developers and banks who own the product. So we think we have a great kind of model that is out there. And now we have a year and a half that's actually proving that it works well, the people where doing business with are very happy, we have repeat customers now in the WAAM world who wants to do more product with that. So I think that we have a great model to move that business more towards the asset-light that we talked about in the past becoming less asset dependent, taking down the balance sheet and increasing their ROIC on that business."

As for when the bookings are most heavily done, it's generally in the first and heavily in the second quarter. So it's the first half of the year obviously teeing up for the summer. Bookings have in general diminished, they're definitely shortening. People are shopping around more waiting for good deals, so to speak. And so we expect to be in the same kind of a pattern with maybe a little bit of push to the later period for the bookings for this year. With respect to the U.K. situation, I can't say that we've seen much of an increase with the euro pound trading, but again it's kind of early game here, so it's a little hard to define exactly what will happen. We also have the Olympics over in London this year as you know. That we, we're not sure what the impact out that will be. And so we are watching it very carefully, we're watching the booking patterns to determine if we think there will be an impact and if we need to make any movement on pricing. And as for the long haul versus the short haul, have not seen anything that is really directed that to be the issue. Some of our package deals to southern Europe had been a bit lighter coming out of the U.K. but it's also a function of the booking window getting tighter, because we may see it more of it in the second quarter."

So we're not suggesting that the booking is changing from being all in January to being all in June, but it's just sliding to be a tighter window towards that heavy summer travel. So depending on which market we're in, the inner Dutch market, for example, we saw a more dramatic tightening of the booking window in 2011 than we saw in 2010. the U.K. window in 2011 was not that dissimilar in 2010.

So there are situations where we feel that it's more advantageous to go into market that we've been trying to get into for a while where the pricing hasn't been appropriate, now we see that pricing available and we said, okay, let's grab that market someplace we feel like we need more product based on what our customers are telling us, because we ask them were would they like to know, where would you like to see more inventory. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. At the end of the day, we feel like we're doing an optimal job managing the capital allocation for inventory versus spending the finished building versus buying.

We bought in a project in Panama Beach, Florida candidate under this WAAM model. So the model has always been of the year available. I think even during good times there'll be opportunities and I think. Times the price will shift a little bit. It will be away from the product that is on the market, that is weighing the market down right now which with too much ownership condos, it will shift to the developers who are now developing a product for building new hotels, some new ownership condo and they won't also some timeshare product in the mix and we will be a great partner for that person who wants to develop it. Timeshare owners spend time in their units, that's a fact, and they tend to spend more per state on ancillary things like restaurants and theater tickets and other activities than a normal hotel stay does. And so the timeshare owners a very attractive person to have in the mix of the development. So I think it shifts from taking but maybe people are calling broken deals to becoming additive to other people's transaction over time."

We saw some softness going to southern Europe from the U.K. So I think I would define it as being more the U.K. traveler. The German traveler continues to be strong, but again, it's not a huge part of U.K. With respect to the OTAs and other agency type of bookings, they are partner. We work with them closely. We feel that there's a place for agency delivery within our distribution channels and we frankly embrace it. Having said that, we would love to get more done on our own websites because it is a more cost efficient way to deliver business for our hotel owners and therefore, we are trying to drive more ways of finding traffic onto our websites to the directive for the direct booking. So the they're complementary to us, they're our partners, but we also like to find ways to drive business into our own websites."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million",2060,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million of free cash flow and over $1 billion in available cash. These results and our long-term earnings and cash flow outlook give us confidence to raise our dividend by 53%. This increase is consistent with our policy of growing our dividend, at least at the rate of growth of our business. 
During 2011, we repurchased 17% of our outstanding shares for $902 million, buying 28.7 million shares at an average price of $31.45. Since our launch as a public company in August 2006, we have repurchased 65 million shares for $2 billion at an average price of just under $31. Operationally, we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives throughout our company. At Wyndham Hotel Group, Apollo, our series of initiatives aimed at improving our value proposition to our hotel owners is well underway and we are seeing measurable success, which I will discuss in a moment. At Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, our RCI team delivered yet another series of technology upgrades to our web capability, increasing customer satisfaction, online share and operating margins. We also made significant progress growing our North American rentals platform with the integration of ResortQuest exceeding our expectations. And we continue to achieve record efficiency levels at Wyndham Vacation Ownership with margins up over 250 basis points and an EBITDA increase of 17% for the year. 
Before going into 2001 (sic) [2011] results, let me spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the economy and within our sector. Despite many macro twists and turns in 2011, the geographic and demographic diversity of our businesses and the resiliency of our fee-for-service business models provided a stable base for us to grow. We expect that also to be the case in 2012. In 2011, hotel industry demand hit a new all-time high, with more room nights sold than ever before. However, rates charged for hotel rooms have not recovered to pre-2009 levels. The net is that RevPAR improved during 2011 and we believe this positive trend should continue in 2012. 
According to a study conducted by Atmosphere Research Group in October, while only 29% of U.S. travelers favorably viewed their 2011 financial condition, 43% believe their finances will be better in 2012. And travelers who expect their finances to improve outnumber those who are pessimistic about their finances by more than 2 to 1. Most travelers expect to take the same number of trips, which is 7 on average, in 2012 as they did in 2011. They also expect to spend about the same amount of money on travel as last year, which is about $3,200. This is consistent with the continuing, gradual recovery we foresee in our U.S. businesses, which contribute nearly 70% of our EBITDA. In the hotel group, we finished 2011 ahead of expectations and we expect a strong 2012 with RevPAR increases of 5% to 8%. In our Exchange and Rental business, 2011 was our first full year with ResortQuest and North American Vacation Rentals market. This business is running ahead of our plans, with great momentum carrying into 2012. RCI held its annual affiliate event in New York last month. The record attendance indicates that interest among timeshare developers is strong and growing. New sources of financing for the overall timeshare industry are still evolving, and the mood was more optimistic than I've seen in a long time. And of course, our own timeshare business continues to exceed expectations. Despite some significant dips in consumer confidence during the year, our timeshare owners continue to demonstrate the value they place on vacations with arrivals at our resorts reaching an all-time high. And our sales force demonstrated its ability to sell the product, as volume per guest also reached all-time highs. So in the U.S., we expect to see a continuing gradual improvement in the economy. 
In Europe, however, where the majority of our Vacation Rental businesses are based, the economic climate remains challenging and the future uncertain. In this region, which is about 15% of our EBITDA, we continue to see the shortening of booking windows and pressure on yields as customers become increasingly value focused. Despite these challenges, the strong value proposition of our products and the strength of our established local brands lead us to expect that our European Rentals business will remain stable in 2012. 
Against this economic backdrop, we continue to focus on 2 areas to increase shareholder value. The first is a focus on execution. That means ensuring we execute to capture more than our fair share of the U.S. economy recover. We expect our domestic RevPAR, for example, gains to be ahead of the industry. Great execution also means taking steps to mitigate the impact of a potential economic downturn in Europe. As always, we'll be disciplined in discretionary spending, and we'll continue to invest in our resilient fee-for-service businesses. 
One final comment on execution is that we have strong operating plans that leverage our competitive advantages and we are adaptable to changing conditions. We've proven our ability to operate in difficult conditions over the last 5 years and we expect nothing less in 2012. The second area of focus is capital allocation. In 2011 we returned $1 billion of available cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have a well established capital allocation plan, which includes investing in our businesses through acquisitions, paying dividends and share repurchases, and we will continue to execute against that framework. Tom will discuss this more in detail later.
Now let's take a look at our business units in more detail. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make great progress in executing its online strategy as part of its Apollo initiatives. Online bookings are a growing portion of the hotel reservation process and now account for about 1/3 of total hotel and lodging industry revenue. Study show consumers are spending on an increasing amount of time shopping and comparing hotel options online, often visiting between 8 to 15 different websites to make an informed decision. Our goal is to capture a maximum amount of that traffic and to ensure that page views result in booking click-throughs or conversions. We've developed a comprehensive multifaceted plan to drive more room nights to our hotels through our online direct distribution channels. The launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first steps. Most of our brand websites have now been updated. Results are excellent with conversion rates up on average 20%. 
In December, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 1/2 of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information. Initial results of the pilot are positive. We plan on adding TripAdvisor ratings to all our brand websites in 2012. We have also launched an umbrella cross-brand website, wyndhamhotelgroup.com, which is designed to aggregate traffic and provide a vehicle to attract customers who are looking to shop all of our brands on one site. These efforts are supported by another initiative under our direct strategy, our investment along with 5 other hotel companies in roomkey.com. We believe roomkey.com will provide consumers with a trustworthy and uncluttered way to compare and book hotels through a superior hotel shopping experience, while driving bookings directly to our own online channels. roomkey.com provides a new cost effective channel for our owners and will better meet the needs of consumers who currently shop across multiple sites before booking. 
Wyndham Hotel Group will be rolling out additional initiatives over the course of the year including new mobile sites and apps, all designed to drive more online businesses and develop a more profitable channel mix for the owners of our hotels. Of course, we have had much success in driving online transactions within our Wyndham Exchange and Rentals unit where over the course of 3 years, we have built the best online timeshare exchange and club servicing platform in the industry. We are pleased with the results of our latest rci.com enhancements introduced in October. As we explained previously, this release included several major milestones such as improved search functionalities like points members and the innovative recommendation engine, which provides proactive travel recommendations to members based on their individual preferences. The results since launch have been measurable, with favorable feedback from users and increases in points transactions and web share. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 7% increase in points transactions, and we continue to see the resulting improved efficiency in our exchange operations, with online transactions share growing to 39% in the fourth quarter compared to 30% in last year's fourth quarter and 13% when we started the project. 
On the rental side, we made great progress in growing our North American rental business in the fourth quarter by integrating 2 acquisitions in key Colorado and Florida markets. ResortQuest finished off a great 2011, meeting revenue goals and exceeding earnings expectations by capitalizing on the operating synergies within Wyndham Worldwide. In 2012, we expect continued growth in our North American rental business, with additional synergies expected to drive improved efficiency and growth in earnings. In addition to organic growth, we hope to add to this business through select acquisitions in 2012.
We're also pleased with the performance of our Vacation Rental businesses in Europe. As you know, we have many well-established brands with loyal customer bases across the U.K., Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Despite the challenging conditions, our businesses remain stable. We expect the same for the upcoming year as Europeans continue to look to Vacation Rentals as a great value, and our product is located where they want to vacation.
Finally, turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another great year, generating over $500 million in EBITDA. The businesses outperformed our expectations every quarter since we rightsized the business in late 2008. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our corporate focus on fee-for-service businesses that generate significant free cash flow. The first step was establishing Wyndham asset affiliation model, or WAAM, which offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks holding newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced what we call WAAM 2.0, where we sell not only the inventory, but also offer consumer loans. WAAM 2.0 has continued to evolve. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capitalized operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal in December 2011, and expect to start sales in the third quarter of 2012.
Last quarter, I spoke of a new marketing initiative on our timeshare business, which enables us to better target new buyers. As you know, new owner acquisition is an important strategy for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It's critical that we maintain a healthy pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership as new owners drive upgrade sales in the future. I'm pleased to report that during 2011 we added approximately 27,000 new owners exceeding our goal. We expect continued strength in 2012 as we remain focused on generating high quality tours and improving our already high efficiencies. 
In summary, 2011 was a strong year across the board, and I'm excited about 2012 and our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to comment on our Count On Me! culture at Wyndham Worldwide. We just received results from our biannual employee survey. Our employee engagement scores ranked with best-in-class companies. This indicates that Wyndham Associates are committed, loyal and proud. They have a strong sense of personal responsibility in delivering a great experience for our customers and great results for the company. And while it's gratifying to see the survey results, I wasn't surprised because I see the real proof everyday in the action of our associates and every quarter in our results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note.",2258,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong business unit execution and our ongoing commitment to focus on generating cash and making smart capital allocation decisions. We came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, reflecting the impact of the fourth quarter share repurchases, as well as lower interest expense, D&A and taxes. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of $44 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the lodging business, was flat compared to the same period of 2010, and slightly better than our expectations. Remember that we had expected quarter 4 EBITDA to be down year-over-year reflecting, among other factors, the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs at the Hotel Group and increased information security costs at corporate. 
Free cash flow increased to $754 million for the full year. Now excluding the one-time VAT refund and related interest income of $67 million, free cash flow normalized to $687 million for the year. As you know, I have said often that cash is the great enabler. We will use our significant free cash flow to support growth and build shareholder value. This will enable us to invest in the business, including acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We expect the deployment of cash flow, combined with the organic growth of our businesses, to generate annual earnings per share growth approximating 20% a year over the next 5 years. 
As Steve noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which is a 32% payout at the midpoint of our 2012 net income guidance range. In addition, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter, spending $225 million. In 2012, to market close last evening, we purchased an additional 1.5 million shares for a total of $60 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with our Hotel Group. Revenues are up 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Now a portion of that increase reflects a reporting reclassification of $15 million which had no impact on EBITDA. Excluding reclassifications, revenues were up 6% reflecting improved domestic RevPAR, and incremental revenues from our newly opened Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. 
As mentioned earlier, we had non-cash writeoffs at the Hotel Group in the fourth quarter. Let me take a minute to walk you through the components of this non-cash charge. First, when we purchased the Wyndham brand in 2005, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to approximately 60 of the existing franchise and management contracts, creating an intangible asset on the balance sheet. The brand has evolved over the past 6 years and many of those original contracts are no longer in the system. As a result, we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately $14 million. We now have 100 hotels in the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand, and nearly 70% are new flags since acquisition.
Second, we have determined that we are unlikely to realize expected returns from investments at 3 managed properties, and we believe the prudent course is to write down the investments by approximately $30 million. These investments made at the height of the market were primarily related to development advances and management agreements. Now again, these are non-cash asset impairments. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by the unfavorable timing of marketing costs, which we described in our third quarter call. RevPAR recovery continued in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 5%. Now in the U.S. fourth quarter RevPAR improved 8.4% versus a year ago, reflecting improvements in both occupancy and rate.
International RevPAR was down 3% due primarily to the rapid growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and some softness in Europe. We ended the year with 613,100 rooms in the system. Excluding the Corinthia and Ramada U.K. terminations, which we disclosed in the previous quarters, the system size increased by 1%. The pipeline sit at nearly 112,000 rooms at December 31, 2011, down slightly sequentially reflecting strong room openings of close to 15,000 in quarter 4.
For the full year, contract signings were up 15% compared with 2010, and we executed 399 conversion deals compared with 363 deals in 2010, about a 10% increase.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals did a great job of delivering their financial results despite FX headwinds and a difficult economic environment in Europe. Total revenue in constant currency was up 4% in the fourth quarter reflecting acquisitions, which contributed $14 million in incremental revenues. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of acquisitions in foreign currency. The impact of the acquisitions of Vacation Rental businesses, which have seasonally light sales in the fourth quarter, exacerbated quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Reflecting negative foreign exchange impact, exchange revenues decreased by 2% in the quarter. The average number of members was flat. In constant currency, exchange revenue and exchange revenue per member were also flat. 
Vacation Rental revenues increased 10% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenue was flat, with average net price per rental up 5% and Vacation Rental transactions down 5%. This reflects active yield management offset by volume declines at our Dutch and U.K. businesses, consistent with the lower consumer confidence in those regions.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues in the one in the fourth quarter of 2011 both increased 6% with tours up 8% and volume per guest up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. We also benefited from higher WAAM conditions. We made good progress in expanding our pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. In 2011, we welcomed 27,000 new WV owners to the Wyndham family, that's a 23% increase compared with 2010 and has exceeded our goal for the year. Our property management business continued to contribute predictable recurring fee-for-service revenues in 2011 producing $56 million of EBITDA. Consumer finance revenues in the quarter were down slightly, reflecting the decrease in our contract receivable portfolio. And interest expense was flat. 
Looking at portfolio performance, delinquency and default rates were flat. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was flat and writeoffs during the fourth quarter were $75 million. As Steve mentioned, we signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal. Now the accounting for these transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet on a just-in-time basis. We'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Going forward, we will refer to this type of deal as WAAM/Just in Time. This arrangement will enable us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. 
Now moving to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, corporate expenses were higher, primarily reflecting increased data security and higher employee-related- costs. Now let's turn to our 2012 guidance. We're going to post full guidance details including cash flow to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the highlights, revenue guidance remains at $4.4 billion  to $4.6 billion, up 4% to 8% from 2011, and EBITDA guidance remains at $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 up 6% to 8% from 2011. Because of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2012 to $2.85 to $3, with a diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares, which assumes no additional share repurchases in 2012.
Those ranges translate to approximately 18% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56 per share. Now please note that as cash flow and share repurchase continue to be an important part of our investment thesis, we have considered whether to include share repurchase in our guidance assumptions. We've decided to adhere to our current practice of not doing so to allow for investment in our business, including acquisitions when opportunities present themselves. We view share repurchase as an attractive opportunity as well, of course, which we will weigh against M&A opportunities in our capital allocation decision process.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance at each of our business units, starting with the Hotel group. This year, our growth expectations for the lodging business reflect, in part, our decision to charge a higher licensing fee to our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand, which we believe has been of tremendous benefit to our timeshare business over the past few years. Additionally, we expect increased contributions from our recently completed Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. Excluding these new items, the normalized EBITDA growth rate for the Hotel Group for 2012 would be 8% to 10%. In addition, we expect RevPAR to be up by 5% to 8%, and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be $835 million to $875 million and EBITDA in the range of $260 million to $270 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. In exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat to down 2%, primarily reflecting the loss of an affiliate with approximately 60,000 members. This affiliate's requests resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. We expect exchange revenue per member to be flat to up 2%, reflecting higher transaction pricing in other member-related revenue, offset by negative currency impacts.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 4% to 7% and average net price per Vacation Rentals to be flat to down 3%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.44 billion to $1.51 billion, and EBITDA of $335 million to $355 million. Note that our growth expectations in Exchange and Rentals continues to be mid-single digits through 2015. The 2012 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange headwinds and the macro-environment challenges in Europe. 
Finally, moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect gross DOI sales to be up slightly from 2011 to $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, which includes approximately $120 million in gross WAAM sales, a 1% to 4% increase in tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of $2.15 billion to $2.225 billion, and EBITDA of $515 million to $540 million. Excluding the increased licensing fee to the Hotel group, we expect a normalized growth rate at vacation ownership in the mid-single digits.
Based on the improvements we've made to the credit standards and the performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline this year to $315 million to $335 million. Regarding our outlook for the ABS markets, 2011, of course, was our best year ever. We were able to obtain an average advance rate of 95% based on the quality of our portfolio and favorable market conditions. Each of our deals included a BB tranche. Going forward, we may choose not to access the BB market for each and every deal due to higher costs to secure investor demand. Accordingly, we expect 2012 advance rates to normalize in the high 80s.
We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $93 million to $100 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information security and IT in general. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $185 million to $190 million, somewhat higher than 2011, reflecting the opening of our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and technology investments. We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $140 million, Now remember, our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means our goal would be to add debt as we add EBITDA. Our interest expense guidance assumes our current debt profile. Any additional debt will incur, of course, additional interest expense, and we'll update our guidance when and if appropriate. 
We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 38% consistent with 2011. We also expect to spend $195 million to $210 million in CapEx. This is slightly higher than our 5-year plan baseline, which is about $180 million to $200 million. We expect to get back to those levels in the next year or so. We expect to spend between $110 million and $120 million in timeshare development in 2012, up from the $80 million we disclosed in 2011, and closer to our projection of a $150 million average over the 5-year period starting in 2011.
Based on our current forecast, we expect free cash flow to be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With financing activities, we expect that 2012 available cash could be close to $1 billion. We will use that additional cash, of course, to invest in the business including M&A and a return to shareholders through additional share repurchase. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

First of all, the initiatives that we've put in place over the last several years, these Apollo initiatives that we've talked about, are really starting to kick in now. Our websites have been upgraded and they needed to be upgraded and they've been upgraded. And some of the other online initiatives will continue to drive traffic to those websites and we hope to convert and capture more. So I think that is one element of helping. The other element helping is our mix. As we add more Wyndham product, which we have a very good pipeline of, that Wyndham product comes at a higher RevPAR, so just the general mix of us should lift us above the average if you looked at just our component pieces. So that's really the reason for the RevPAR, what we think will be an outpaced RevPAR performance. And we've been doing very well in our online efforts. With respect to WAAM 2.0, or WAAM/Just in Time, that is a relatively manageable number for us as we've told you in the past. We try to balance taking off of our balance sheet product, as well as taking advantage of a marketplace that's attractive right now. Do we think it could be more than the 15%? Over time, Joe, it definitely could be. The reception for this WAAM product that we're providing has been very strong from developers and banks who own the product. So I think we have a great kind of model that's out there. And now we have a year and a half of actually proving that it works well. The people that we do business with are very happy. We have repeat customers now in the WAAM world who want us to do more product with them. So I think that we have a great model to move that business more towards the asset light that we've talked about in the past becoming less asset dependent, taking down the balance sheet and increasing their ROIC on that business."

On the inventory we probably have somewhere between, I don't know, 6, 7, maybe more years worth of inventory because you're right, it only came down about $100 million this year.

I would expect to continue to see that kind of decline. And when you look at what we have on our balance sheet right now, you just kind of do the math you probably come to the -- we have at least 6, 7, maybe more years worth of inventory. Now that could be drawn out further and the tail could be extended if we do more WAAM product. And again, that's part of the balancing act that we see.

As for when the bookings are most heavily done, it's generally in the first and heavily in the second quarter. So it's the first half of the year, obviously teeing up for the summer. Booking windows have, in general, diminished. So they're definitely shortening. People are shopping around more, waiting for good deals, so to speak. And so we expect to be in the same kind of a pattern with maybe a little bit of a push to the later period for the bookings for this year. With respect to the U.K. situation, I can't say that we've seen much of an increase with the euro-pound trading, but again it's kind of early game here so it's a little hard to define exactly what will happen. We also have the Olympics over in London this year, as you know. We're not sure what the impact of that will be. And so we're watching it very carefully and watching the booking patterns to determine if we think there will be an impact and if we need to make any movement on pricing. And as for the long haul versus the short haul, I can't say that I've seen anything that has really directed that to be the issue.

So we're not suggesting that the booking is changing from being all in January to being all in June, but it's just sliding to be a tighter window towards that heavy summer travel. So depending on which market we're in, the inner Dutch market, for example, we saw a more dramatic tightening of the booking window in 2011 than we saw in 2010. The U.K. window in 2011 was not real dissimilar from 2010. So it really depends on market, but it's not a full quarter slide. It would be probably measured in weeks or a month, not multiple months."

In 2012, we don't see advance rates improving above last year's rates. It's practically impossible. So you should interpret the difference being that at some point in time, we'll raise additional debt based on our incremental EBITDA."

As we've said in the past, most of what we have on our balance sheet, some of it is completely finished inventory and we're selling that. Some of it requires an additional capital spend in order to complete it for us to be able to sell it. So there's additional fresh capital go out to finish those projects. I think, and as we've said in the past, this is kind of one of those things that we're paid to do. We have to look at what's available out in the market, what we have on the balance sheet, the location of the inventory, the quality of the inventory, there's a lot of factors that go into it and this is a conversation that Tom and I have with the guys who run the timeshare business and our Chief Real Estate Officer on a regular basis. So there are situations where we feel that it's more advantageous to go into a market that we've been trying to get into for a while where the pricing hasn't been appropriate, where now we see that pricing available and  we say, ""Okay, well let's grab that market at some place that we feel like we need more product based on what our customers are telling us."" Because we ask them were would they like to go, where would they like to see more inventory. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. At the end of the day, we feel like we're doing an optimum job managing the capital allocation for inventory versus spending the finished building versus buying. And it's one of those things time will tell whether we've made good use of the capital. I think we're seeing the cost of sales go down, which is one of the results of being opportunistic out there in the market."

It's not a whole lot different. There are definitely some softer spots. The U.K. has been softer, and again, we don't know everything that's impacting that and we're not doing anything dramatic at this point because frankly, we don't think there's a need to do anything dramatic with respect to pricing. We feel that we will see the results kind of bleed in over the next few months. So I am trying to answer this question in a different way than it's already been asked, just to give you some other additional color, but we really can't tell a whole lot. As we've said, we think that, that will be a challenge region. However, we've also said that we think that because of the business model we have and where we have our product, we will be stable in that market. And I think stable is the new up in that market. And so we're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned. And also, as we've shown in the past, we have always been resilient and able to adjust and adapt our model to whatever the market conditions are. So when we saw the decline in 2009, our businesses there grew. We shifted, we brought product in different locations and we managed to find growth in that market which others we're not seeing growth in. So we are calling for a stable euro out there. We're making that call based on what we're seeing right now."

One is the WAAM model -- and we said this before, I think actually before you were involved in our story. We talked about the WAAM model developing, and it's something that's existed for a while. We did a deal probably 5 years ago now during the peak of good times where we brought in product under a WAAM model. We didn't call it WAAM at the time because we weren't focused on that as a market initiative, we focused on that opportunity as just being opportunistic. We brought in a project in Panama City Beach, Florida and did it under this WAAM model. So the model has always been out there and available. I think even during good times there will be opportunities. And I think during the good times, it'll probably shift a little bit. It'll be away from the product that is on the market, that is weighing the market down right now with too much whole ownership condos. It'll shift to being developers who are now developing new product who are building a hotel, some whole ownership condos and they want also some timeshare product in the mix. And we will be a great partner for that person who wants to develop it. Timeshare owners spend time in their units, that's a fact, and they tend to spend more per stay on ancillary things like restaurants and theater tickets and other activities than a normal hotel stay does. And so the timeshare owner is a very attractive person to have in the mix of the development. So I think it shifts from being taking maybe what people are calling broken deals to becoming additive to other people's transactions over time."

Having said that, we would love to get more done on our own websites because it's the most cost efficient way to deliver business for our hotel owners, and therefore, we are trying to drive more ways of finding traffic onto our websites to book directly for the direct booking.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million",2060,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million of free cash flow and over $1 billion in available cash. These results and our long term earnings and cash flow outlook give us confidence to raise our dividend by 53%. This increase is consistent with our policy of growing our dividend, at least at the rate of growth of our business. 
During 2011, we repurchased 17% of our outstanding shares for $902 million, buying 28.7 million shares at an average price of $31.45. Since our launch as a public company in August 2006, we have repurchased 65 million shares for $2 billion at an average price of just under $31. Operationally, we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives throughout our company. At Wyndham Hotel Group, Apollo, our series of initiatives aimed at improving our value proposition to our hotel owners, is well underway and we are seeing measurable success, which I will discuss in a moment. At Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, our RCI team delivered yet another series of technology upgrades to our web capability, increasing customer satisfaction, online share and operating margins. We also made significant progress growing our North American rentals platform with the integration of ResortQuest, exceeding our expectations. And we continue to achieve record efficiency levels at Wyndham Vacation Ownership with margins up over 250 basis points and an EBITDA increase of 17% for the year. 
Before going into 2001 (sic)  results, let me spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the economy and within our sector. Despite many macro twists and turns in 2011, the geographic and demographic diversity of our businesses and the resiliency of our fee-for-service business models provided a stable base for us to grow. We expect that also to be the case in 2012. In 2011, hotel industry demand hit a new all-time high, with more room nights sold than ever before. However, rates charged for hotel rooms have not recovered to pre-2009 levels. The net is that RevPAR improved during 2011 and we believe this positive trend should continue in 2012. 
  According to a study conducted by Atmosphere Research Group in October, while only 29% of U.S. travelers favorably viewed their 2011 financial condition, 43% believe their finances will be better in 2012. And travelers who expect their finances to improve outnumber those who are pessimistic about their finances by more than 2 to 1. Most travelers expect to take the same number of trips, which is 7 on average, in 2012 as they did in 2011. They also expect to spend about the same amount of money on travel as last year, which is about $3,200. This is consistent with the continuing, gradual recovery we foresee in our U.S. businesses, which contribute nearly 70% of our EBITDA. In the hotel group, we finished 2011 ahead of expectations and we expect a strong 2012 with RevPAR increases of 5% to 8%. In our Exchange and Rental business, 2011 was our first full year with ResortQuest and North American Vacation Rentals market. This business is running ahead of our plans, with great momentum carrying into 2012. RCI held its annual affiliate event in New York last month. The record attendance indicates that interest among timeshare developers is strong and growing. New sources of financing for the overall timeshare industry are still evolving, and the mood was more optimistic than I've seen in a long time. And of course, our own timeshare business continues to exceed expectations. Despite some significant dips in consumer confidence during the year, our timeshare owners continue to demonstrate the value they place on vacations with arrivals at our resorts reaching an all-time high. And our sales force demonstrated its ability to sell the product, as volume per guest also reached all-time highs. So in the U.S., we expect to see a continuing gradual improvement in the economy. 
 
 In Europe, however, where the majority of our Vacation Rental businesses are based, the economic climate remains challenging and the future uncertain. In this region, which is about 15% of our EBITDA, we continue to see the shortening of booking windows and pressure on yields as customers become increasingly value focused. Despite these challenges, the strong value proposition of our products and the strength of our established local brands lead us to expect that our European Rentals business will remain stable in 2012. 
 
 Against this economic backdrop, we continue to focus on 2 areas to increase shareholder value. The first is a focus on execution. That means ensuring we execute to capture more than our fair share of the U.S. economy recover. We expect our domestic RevPAR, for example, gains to be ahead of the industry. Great execution also means taking steps to mitigate the impact of a potential economic downturn in Europe. As always, we'll be disciplined in discretionary spending, and we'll continue to invest in our resilient fee-for-service businesses. 
 
 One final comment on execution is that we have strong operating plans that leverage our competitive advantages and we are adaptable to changing conditions. We've proven our ability to operate in difficult conditions over the last 5 years and we expect nothing less in 2012. The second area of focus is capital allocation. In 2011 we returned $1 billion of available cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have a well established capital allocation plan, which includes investing in our businesses through acquisitions, paying dividends and share repurchases, and we will continue to execute against that framework. Tom will discuss this more in detail later.
Now let's take a look at our business units in more detail. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make great progress in executing its online strategy as part of its Apollo initiatives. Online bookings are a growing portion of the hotel reservation process and now account for about 1/3 of total hotel and lodging industry revenue. Study show consumers are spending on an increasing amount of time shopping and comparing hotel options online, often visiting between 8 to 15 different websites to make an informed decision. Our goal is to capture a maximum amount of that traffic and to ensure that page views result in booking click-throughs or conversions. We've developed a comprehensive multifaceted plan to drive more room nights to our hotels through our online direct distribution channels. The launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first steps. Most of our brand websites have now been updated. Results are excellent with conversion rates up on average 20%. 
 
 In December, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 1/2 of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information. Initial results of the pilot are positive. We plan on adding TripAdvisor ratings to all our brand websites in 2012. We have also launched an umbrella cross-brand website, wyndhamhotelgroup.com, which is designed to aggregate traffic and provide a vehicle to attract consumers who are looking to shop all of our brands on one site. These efforts are supported by another initiative under our direct strategy, our investment along with 5 other hotel companies in roomkey.com. We believe roomkey.com will provide consumers with a trustworthy and uncluttered way to compare and book hotels through a superior hotel shopping experience, while driving bookings directly to our own online channels. roomkey.com provides a new cost effective channel for our owners and will better meet the needs of consumers who currently shop across multiple sites before booking. 
  
Wyndham Hotel Group will be rolling out additional initiatives over the course of the year, including new mobile sites and apps, all designed to drive more online businesses and develop a more profitable channel mix for the owners of our hotels. Of course, we have had much success in driving online transactions within our Wyndham Exchange and Rentals unit where over the course of 3 years, we have built the best online timeshare exchange and club servicing platform in the industry. We are pleased with the results of our latest rci.com enhancements introduced in October. As we've explained previously, this release includes several major milestones such as improved search functionalities like points members and the innovative recommendation engine, which provides proactive travel recommendations to members based on their individual preferences. The results since launch have been measurable, with favorable feedback from users and increases in points transactions and web share. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 7% increase in points transactions, and we continue to see the resulting improved efficiency in our exchange operations, with online transactions share growing to 39% in the fourth quarter compared to 30% in last year's fourth quarter and 13% when we started the project. 
 
 On the rental side, we made great progress in growing our North American rental business in the fourth quarter by integrating 2 acquisitions in key Colorado and Florida markets. ResortQuest finished off a great 2011, meeting revenue goals and exceeding earnings expectations by capitalizing on the operating synergies within Wyndham Worldwide. In 2012, we expect continued growth in our North American rental business, with additional synergies expected to drive improved efficiency and growth in earnings. In addition to organic growth, we hope to add to this business through select acquisitions in 2012.
We're also pleased with the performance of our Vacation Rental businesses in Europe. As you know, we have many well-established brands with loyal customer bases across the U.K., Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Despite the challenging conditions, our businesses remain stable. We expect the same for the upcoming year as Europeans continue to look to Vacation Rentals as a great value, and our product is located where they want to vacation.
Finally, turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another great year, generating over $500 million in EBITDA. The businesses outperformed our expectations every quarter since we rightsized the business in late 2008. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our corporate focus on fee-for-service businesses that generate significant free cash flow. The first step was establishing Wyndham asset affiliation model, or WAAM, which offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks holding newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced what we call WAAM 2.0, where we sell not only the inventory, but also offer consumer loans. WAAM 2.0 has continued to evolve. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capitalized operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal in December 2011, and expect to start sales in the third quarter of 2012.
Last quarter, I spoke of a new marketing initiative on our timeshare business, which enables us to better target new buyers. As you know, new owner acquisition is an important strategy for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It's critical that we maintain a healthy pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership as new owners drive upgrade sales in the future. I'm pleased to report that during 2011 we added approximately 27,000 new owners exceeding our goal. We expect continued strength in 2012 as we remain focused on generating high quality tours and improving our already high efficiencies. 
  In summary, 2011 was a strong year across the board, and I'm excited about 2012 and our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to comment on our Count On Me! culture at Wyndham Worldwide. We just received results from our biannual employee survey. Our employee engagement scores ranked with best-in-class companies. This indicates that Wyndham Associates are committed, loyal and proud. They have a strong sense of personal responsibility in delivering a great experience for our customers and great results for the company. And while it's gratifying to see the survey results, I wasn't surprised because I see the real proof everyday in the action of our associates and every quarter in our results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note.",2260,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong business unit execution and our ongoing commitment to focus on generating cash and making smart capital allocation decisions. We came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, reflecting the impact of the fourth quarter share repurchases, as well as lower interest expense, D&A and taxes. 
 
 Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of $44 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the lodging business, was flat compared to the same period of 2010, and slightly better than our expectations. Remember that we had expected quarter 4 EBITDA to be down year-over-year reflecting, among other factors, the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs at the Hotel Group and increased information security costs at corporate. 
  Free cash flow increased to $754 million for the full year. Now excluding the one-time VAT refund and related interest income of $67 million, free cash flow normalized to $687 million for the year. As you know, I have said often that cash is the great enabler. We will use our significant free cash flow to support growth and build shareholder value. This will enable us to invest in the business, including acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We expect the deployment of cash flow, combined with the organic growth of our businesses, to generate annual earnings per share growth approximating 20% a year over the next 5 years. 
 
 As Steve noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which is a 32% payout at the midpoint of our 2012 net income guidance range. In addition, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter, spending $225 million. In 2012, through market close last evening, we purchased an additional 1.5 million shares for a total of $60 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. 
  
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with our Hotel Group. Revenues are up 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Now a portion of that increase reflects a reporting reclassification of $15 million which had no impact on EBITDA. Excluding reclassifications, revenues were up 6% reflecting improved domestic RevPAR, and incremental revenues from our newly opened Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. 
  As mentioned earlier, we had non-cash writeoffs at the Hotel Group in the fourth quarter. Let me take a minute to walk you through the components of this non-cash charge. First, when we purchased the Wyndham brand in 2005, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to approximately 60 of the existing franchise and management contracts, creating an intangible asset on the balance sheet. The brand has evolved over the past 6 years and many of those original contracts are no longer in the system. As a result, we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately $14 million. We now have 100 hotels in the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand, and nearly 70% are new flags since acquisition.
Second, we have determined that we are unlikely to realize expected returns from investments at 3 managed properties, and we believe the prudent course is to write down the investments by approximately $30 million. These investments made at the height of the market were primarily related to development advances and management agreements. Now again, these are non-cash asset impairments. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by the unfavorable timing of marketing costs, which we described in our third quarter call. RevPAR recovery continued in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 5%. Now in the U.S. fourth quarter RevPAR improved 8.4% versus a year ago, reflecting improvements in both occupancy and rate.
International RevPAR was down 3% due primarily to the rapid growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and some softness in Europe. We ended the year with 613,100 rooms in the system. Excluding the Corinthia and Ramada U.K. terminations, which we disclosed in the previous quarters, the system size increased by 1%. The pipelines sit at nearly 112,000 rooms at December 31, 2011, down slightly sequentially, reflecting strong room openings of close to 15,000 in quarter 4.
For the full year, contract signings were up 15% compared with 2010, and we executed 399 conversion deals compared with 363 deals in 2010, about a 10% increase.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals did a great job of delivering their financial results despite FX headwinds and a difficult economic environment in Europe. Total revenue in constant currency was up 4% in the fourth quarter reflecting acquisitions, which contributed $14 million in incremental revenues. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of acquisitions in foreign currency. The impact of the acquisitions of Vacation Rental businesses, which have seasonally light sales in the fourth quarter, exacerbated quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Reflecting negative foreign exchange impact, exchange revenues decreased by 2% in the quarter. The average number of members was flat. In constant currency, exchange revenue and exchange revenue per member were also flat. 
  Vacation Rental revenues increased 10% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenue was flat, with average net price per rental up 5% and Vacation Rental transactions down 5%. This reflects active yield management offset by volume declines at our Dutch and U.K. businesses, consistent with the lower consumer confidence in those regions.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues in EBITDA in the one in the fourth quarter of 2011 both increased 6% with tours up 8% and volume per guest up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. We also benefited from higher WAAM conditions. We made good progress in expanding our pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. In 2011, we welcomed 27,000 new WV owners to the Wyndham family, that's a 23% increase compared with 2010 and has exceeded our goal for the year. Our property management business continued to contribute predictable recurring fee-for-service revenues in 2011, producing $56 million of EBITDA. Consumer finance revenues in the quarter were down slightly, reflecting the decrease in our contract receivable portfolio. And interest expense was flat. 
 
 Looking at portfolio performance, delinquency and default rates were flat. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was flat and writeoffs during the fourth quarter were $75 million. As Steve mentioned, we signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal. Now the accounting for these transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet on a just-in-time basis. We'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Going forward, we will refer to this type of deal as WAAM/Just in Time. This arrangement will enable us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. 
  Now moving to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, corporate expenses were higher, primarily reflecting increased data security and higher employee-related- costs. Now let's turn to our 2012 guidance. We're going to post full guidance details including cash flow to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the highlights, revenue guidance remains at $4.4 billion  to $4.6 billion, up 4% to 8% from 2011, and EBITDA guidance remains at $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 up 6% to 8% from 2011. Because of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2012 to $2.85 to $3, with a diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares, which assumes no additional share repurchases in 2012.
Those ranges translate to approximately 18% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56 per share. Now please note that as cash flow and share repurchase continue to be an important part of our investment thesis, we have considered whether to include share repurchase in our guidance assumptions. We've decided to adhere to our current practice of not doing so to allow for investment in our business, including acquisitions when opportunities present themselves. We view share repurchase as an attractive opportunity as well, of course, which we will weigh against M&A opportunities in our capital allocation decision process.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance at each of our business units, starting with the Hotel group. This year, our growth expectations for the lodging business reflect, in part, our decision to charge a higher licensing fee to our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand, which we believe has been of tremendous benefit to our timeshare business over the past few years. Additionally, we expect increased contributions from our recently completed Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. Excluding these new items, the normalized EBITDA growth rate for the Hotel Group for 2012 would be 8% to 10%. In addition, we expect RevPAR to be up by 5% to 8%, and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be $835 million to $875 million and EBITDA in the range of $260 million to $270 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. In exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat to down 2%, primarily reflecting the loss of an affiliate with approximately 60,000 members. This affiliate's requests resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. We expect exchange revenue per member to be flat to up 2%, reflecting higher transaction pricing in other member-related revenue, offset by negative currency impacts.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 4% to 7% and average net price per Vacation Rentals to be flat to down 3%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.44 billion to $1.51 billion, and EBITDA of $335 million to $355 million. Note that our growth expectations in Exchange and Rentals continues to be mid-single digits through 2015. The 2012 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange headwinds and the macro-environment challenges in Europe. 
  
Finally, moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect gross DOI sales to be up slightly from 2011 to $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, which includes approximately $120 million in gross WAAM sales, a 1% to 4% increase in tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of $2.15 billion to $2.225 billion, and EBITDA of $515 million to $540 million. Excluding the increased licensing fee to the Hotel group, we expect a normalized growth rate at vacation ownership in the mid-single digits.
Based on the improvements we've made to the credit standards and the performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline this year to $315 million to $335 million. Regarding our outlook for the ABS markets, 2011, of course, was our best year ever. We were able to obtain an average advance rate of 95% based on the quality of our portfolio and favorable market conditions. Each of our deals included a BB tranche. Going forward, we may choose not to access the BB market for each and every deal due to higher costs to secure investor demand. Accordingly, we expect 2012 advance rates to normalize in the high 80s.
We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $93 million to $100 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information security and IT in general. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $185 million to $190 million, somewhat higher than 2011, reflecting the opening of our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and technology investments. We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $140 million. Now remember, our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means our goal would be to add debt as we add EBITDA. Our interest expense guidance assumes our current debt profile. Any additional debt will incur, of course, additional interest expense, and we'll update our guidance when and if appropriate. 
 
 We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 38% consistent with 2011. We also expect to spend $195 million to $210 million in CapEx. This is slightly higher than our 5-year plan baseline, which is about $180 million to $200 million. We expect to get back to those levels in the next year or so. We expect to spend between $110 million and $120 million in timeshare development in 2012, up from the $80 million we disclosed in 2011, and closer to our projection of a $150 million average over the 5-year period starting in 2011.
Based on our current forecast, we expect free cash flow to be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With financing activities, we expect that 2012 available cash could be close to $1 billion. We will use that additional cash, of course, to invest in the business including M&A and a return to shareholders through additional share repurchase. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

First of all, the initiatives that we've put in place over the last several years, these Apollo initiatives that we've talked about, are really starting to kick in now. Our websites have been upgraded and they needed to be upgraded and they've been upgraded. And some of the other online initiatives will continue to drive traffic to those websites and we hope to convert and capture more. So I think that is one element of helping. The other element helping is our mix. As we add more Wyndham product, which we have a very good pipeline of, that Wyndham product comes at a higher RevPAR, so just the general mix of us should lift us above the average if you looked at just our component pieces. So that's really the reason for the RevPAR, what we think will be an outpaced RevPAR performance. And we've been doing very well in our online efforts. With respect to WAAM 2.0, or WAAM/Just in Time, that is a relatively manageable number for us, as we've told you in the past. We try to balance taking off of our balance sheet product, as well as taking advantage of a marketplace that's attractive right now. Do we think it could be more than the 15%? Over time, Joe, it definitely could be. The reception for this WAAM product that we're providing has been very strong from developers and banks who own the product. So I think we have a great kind of model that's out there. And now we have a year and a half of actually proving that it works well. The people that we do business with are very happy. We have repeat customers now in the WAAM world who want us to do more product with them. So I think that we have a great model to move that business more towards the asset light that we've talked about in the past becoming less asset dependent, taking down the balance sheet and increasing their ROIC on that business."

Now that could be drawn out further and the tail could be extended if we do more WAAM product. And again, that's part of the balancing act that we see.

And so we're watching it very carefully and watching the booking patterns to determine if we think there will be an impact and if we need to make any movement on pricing. And as for the long haul versus the short haul, I can't say that I've seen anything that has really directed that to be the issue. Some of our packaged deals to southern Europe have been a little bit lighter coming out of the U.K., but it's also a function of the booking window getting tighter because we may see more of it in the second quarter."

And historically, the business has been kind of that booking, as I said, has been spread over the first and second quarter. If I would try to guestimate for 2012 how much would that booking window slide, it would probably be measured in weeks not months, because you've got a bulk of the business all coming within, essentially, a 2-quarter period of time. So we're not suggesting that the booking is changing from being all in January to being all in June, but it's just sliding to be a tighter window towards that heavy summer travel. So depending on which market we're in, the inner Dutch market, for example, we saw a more dramatic tightening of the booking window in 2011 than we saw in 2010. The U.K. window in 2011 was not real dissimilar from 2010. So it really depends on market, but it's not a full quarter slide. It would be probably measured in weeks or a month, not multiple months."

As we've said in the past, most of what we have on our balance sheet, some of it is completely finished inventory and we're selling that. Some of it requires an additional capital spend in order to complete it for us to be able to sell it. So there's additional fresh capital go out to finish those projects. I think, and as we've said in the past, this is kind of one of those things that we're paid to do. We have to look at what's available out in the market, what we have on the balance sheet, the location of the inventory, the quality of the inventory, there's a lot of factors that go into it and this is a conversation that Tom and I have with the guys who run the timeshare business and our Chief Real Estate Officer on a regular basis. So there are situations where we feel that it's more advantageous to go into a market that we've been trying to get into for a while where the pricing hasn't been appropriate, where now we see that pricing available and  we say, ""Okay, well let's grab that market at some place that we feel like we need more product based on what our customers are telling us."" Because we ask them were would they like to go, where would they like to see more inventory. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. At the end of the day, we feel like we're doing an optimum job managing the capital allocation for inventory versus spending the finished building versus buying. And it's one of those things time will tell whether we've made good use of the capital. I think we're seeing the cost of sales go down, which is one of the results of being opportunistic out there in the market."

However, we've also said that we think that because of the business model we have and where we have our product, we will be stable in that market. And I think stable is the new up in that market. And so we're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned. And also, as we've shown in the past, we have always been resilient and able to adjust and adapt our model to whatever the market conditions are. So when we saw the decline in 2009, our businesses there grew. We shifted, we brought product in different locations and we managed to find growth in that market, which others were not seeing growth in. So we are calling for a stable euro out there.

One is the WAAM model -- and we said this before, I think actually before you were involved in our story. We talked about the WAAM model developing, and it's something that's existed for a while. We did a deal probably 5 years ago now during the peak of good times where we brought in product under a WAAM model. We didn't call it WAAM at the time because we weren't focused on that as a market initiative, we focused on that opportunity as just being opportunistic. We brought in a project in Panama City Beach, Florida and did it under this WAAM model. So the model has always been out there and available. I think even during good times there will be opportunities. And I think during the good times, it'll probably shift a little bit. It'll be away from the product that is on the market, that is weighing the market down right now with too much whole ownership condos. It'll shift to being developers who are now developing new product who are building a hotel, some whole ownership condos and they want also some timeshare product in the mix. And we will be a great partner for that person who wants to develop it. Timeshare owners spend time in their units, that's a fact, and they tend to spend more per stay on ancillary things like restaurants and theater tickets and other activities than a normal hotel stay does. And so the timeshare owner is a very attractive person to have in the mix of the development. So I think it shifts from being taking maybe what people are calling broken deals to becoming additive to other people's transactions over time."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million",2061,"Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2011 year-end call. It was a great year for Wyndham Worldwide. We produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. We generated over $750 million of free cash flow and over $1 billion in available cash. These results and our long term earnings and cash flow outlook give us confidence to raise our dividend by 53%. This increase is consistent with our policy of growing our dividend, at least at the rate of growth of our business. 
During 2011, we repurchased 17% of our outstanding shares for $902 million, buying 28.7 million shares at an average price of $31.45. Since our launch as a public company in August 2006, we have repurchased 65 million shares for $2 billion at an average price of just under $31. Operationally, we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives throughout our company. At Wyndham Hotel Group, Apollo, our series of initiatives aimed at improving our value proposition to our hotel owners, is well underway and we are seeing measurable success, which I will discuss in a moment. At Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, our RCI team delivered yet another series of technology upgrades to our web capability, increasing customer satisfaction, online share and operating margins. We also made significant progress growing our North American rentals platform with the integration of ResortQuest, exceeding our expectations. And we continue to achieve record efficiency levels at Wyndham Vacation Ownership with margins up over 250 basis points and an EBITDA increase of 17% for the year. 
Before going into 2001 (sic) [2011] results, let me spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the economy and within our sector. Despite many macro twists and turns in 2011, the geographic and demographic diversity of our businesses and the resiliency of our fee-for-service business models provided a stable base for us to grow. We expect that also to be the case in 2012. In 2011, hotel industry demand hit a new all-time high, with more room nights sold than ever before. However, rates charged for hotel rooms have not recovered to pre-2009 levels. The net is that RevPAR improved during 2011 and we believe this positive trend should continue in 2012. 
  According to a study conducted by Atmosphere Research Group in October, while only 29% of U.S. travelers favorably viewed their 2011 financial condition, 43% believe their finances will be better in 2012. And travelers who expect their finances to improve outnumber those who are pessimistic about their finances by more than 2 to 1. Most travelers expect to take the same number of trips, which is 7 on average, in 2012 as they did in 2011. They also expect to spend about the same amount of money on travel as last year, which is about $3,200. This is consistent with the continuing, gradual recovery we foresee in our U.S. businesses, which contribute nearly 70% of our EBITDA. In the hotel group, we finished 2011 ahead of expectations and we expect a strong 2012 with RevPAR increases of 5% to 8%. In our Exchange and Rental business, 2011 was our first full year with ResortQuest and North American Vacation Rentals market. This business is running ahead of our plans, with great momentum carrying into 2012. RCI held its annual affiliate event in New York last month. The record attendance indicates that interest among timeshare developers is strong and growing. New sources of financing for the overall timeshare industry are still evolving, and the mood was more optimistic than I've seen in a long time. And of course, our own timeshare business continues to exceed expectations. Despite some significant dips in consumer confidence during the year, our timeshare owners continue to demonstrate the value they place on vacations with arrivals at our resorts reaching an all-time high. And our sales force demonstrated its ability to sell the product, as volume per guest also reached all-time highs. So in the U.S., we expect to see a continuing gradual improvement in the economy. 
 
 In Europe, however, where the majority of our Vacation Rental businesses are based, the economic climate remains challenging and the future uncertain. In this region, which is about 15% of our EBITDA, we continue to see the shortening of booking windows and pressure on yields as customers become increasingly value focused. Despite these challenges, the strong value proposition of our products and the strength of our established local brands lead us to expect that our European Rentals business will remain stable in 2012. 
 
 Against this economic backdrop, we continue to focus on 2 areas to increase shareholder value. The first is a focus on execution. That means ensuring we execute to capture more than our fair share of the U.S. economy recover. We expect our domestic RevPAR, for example, gains to be ahead of the industry. Great execution also means taking steps to mitigate the impact of a potential economic downturn in Europe. As always, we'll be disciplined in discretionary spending, and we'll continue to invest in our resilient fee-for-service businesses. 
 
 One final comment on execution is that we have strong operating plans that leverage our competitive advantages and we are adaptable to changing conditions. We've proven our ability to operate in difficult conditions over the last 5 years and we expect nothing less in 2012. The second area of focus is capital allocation. In 2011 we returned $1 billion of available cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have a well established capital allocation plan, which includes investing in our businesses through acquisitions, paying dividends and share repurchases, and we will continue to execute against that framework. Tom will discuss this more in detail later.
Now let's take a look at our business units in more detail. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make great progress in executing its online strategy as part of its Apollo initiatives. Online bookings are a growing portion of the hotel reservation process and now account for about 1/3 of total hotel and lodging industry revenue. Study show consumers are spending on an increasing amount of time shopping and comparing hotel options online, often visiting between 8 to 15 different websites to make an informed decision. Our goal is to capture a maximum amount of that traffic and to ensure that page views result in booking click-throughs or conversions. We've developed a comprehensive multifaceted plan to drive more room nights to our hotels through our online direct distribution channels. The launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first steps. Most of our brand websites have now been updated. Results are excellent with conversion rates up on average 20%. 
 
 In December, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 1/2 of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information. Initial results of the pilot are positive. We plan on adding TripAdvisor ratings to all our brand websites in 2012. We have also launched an umbrella cross-brand website, wyndhamhotelgroup.com, which is designed to aggregate traffic and provide a vehicle to attract consumers who are looking to shop all of our brands on one site. These efforts are supported by another initiative under our direct strategy, our investment along with 5 other hotel companies in roomkey.com. We believe roomkey.com will provide consumers with a trustworthy and uncluttered way to compare and book hotels through a superior hotel shopping experience, while driving bookings directly to our own online channels. roomkey.com provides a new cost effective channel for our owners and will better meet the needs of consumers who currently shop across multiple sites before booking. 
  
Wyndham Hotel Group will be rolling out additional initiatives over the course of the year, including new mobile sites and apps, all designed to drive more online businesses and develop a more profitable channel mix for the owners of our hotels. Of course, we have had much success in driving online transactions within our Wyndham Exchange and Rentals unit where over the course of 3 years, we have built the best online timeshare exchange and club servicing platform in the industry. We are pleased with the results of our latest rci.com enhancements introduced in October. As we've explained previously, this release includes several major milestones such as improved search functionalities like points members and the innovative recommendation engine, which provides proactive travel recommendations to members based on their individual preferences. The results since launch have been measurable, with favorable feedback from users and increases in points transactions and web share. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 7% increase in points transactions, and we continue to see the resulting improved efficiency in our exchange operations, with online transactions share growing to 39% in the fourth quarter compared to 30% in last year's fourth quarter and 13% when we started the project. 
 
 On the rental side, we made great progress in growing our North American rental business in the fourth quarter by integrating 2 acquisitions in key Colorado and Florida markets. ResortQuest finished off a great 2011, meeting revenue goals and exceeding earnings expectations by capitalizing on the operating synergies within Wyndham Worldwide. In 2012, we expect continued growth in our North American rental business, with additional synergies expected to drive improved efficiency and growth in earnings. In addition to organic growth, we hope to add to this business through select acquisitions in 2012.
We're also pleased with the performance of our Vacation Rental businesses in Europe. As you know, we have many well-established brands with loyal customer bases across the U.K., Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Despite the challenging conditions, our businesses remain stable. We expect the same for the upcoming year as Europeans continue to look to Vacation Rentals as a great value, and our product is located where they want to vacation.
Finally, turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another great year, generating over $500 million in EBITDA. The businesses outperformed our expectations every quarter since we rightsized the business in late 2008. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our corporate focus on fee-for-service businesses that generate significant free cash flow. The first step was establishing Wyndham asset affiliation model, or WAAM, which offers turnkey solutions for developers or banks holding newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced what we call WAAM 2.0, where we sell not only the inventory, but also offer consumer loans. WAAM 2.0 has continued to evolve. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capitalized operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal in December 2011, and expect to start sales in the third quarter of 2012.
Last quarter, I spoke of a new marketing initiative on our timeshare business, which enables us to better target new buyers. As you know, new owner acquisition is an important strategy for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It's critical that we maintain a healthy pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership as new owners drive upgrade sales in the future. I'm pleased to report that during 2011 we added approximately 27,000 new owners exceeding our goal. We expect continued strength in 2012 as we remain focused on generating high quality tours and improving our already high efficiencies. 
  In summary, 2011 was a strong year across the board, and I'm excited about 2012 and our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to comment on our Count On Me! culture at Wyndham Worldwide. We just received results from our biannual employee survey. Our employee engagement scores ranked with best-in-class companies. This indicates that Wyndham Associates are committed, loyal and proud. They have a strong sense of personal responsibility in delivering a great experience for our customers and great results for the company. And while it's gratifying to see the survey results, I wasn't surprised because I see the real proof everyday in the action of our associates and every quarter in our results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note.",2260,"Thanks, Steve. I'm going to focus the bulk of my comments today on our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance. As far as our results for 2011, let me echo to Steve's comment that 2011 was a terrific year and that the fourth quarter ended on a good note. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong business unit execution and our ongoing commitment to focus on generating cash and making smart capital allocation decisions. We came in $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range, reflecting the impact of the fourth quarter share repurchases, as well as lower interest expense, D&A and taxes. 
 
 Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of $44 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the lodging business, was flat compared to the same period of 2010, and slightly better than our expectations. Remember that we had expected quarter 4 EBITDA to be down year-over-year reflecting, among other factors, the seasonality of our larger rentals business, continued unfavorable timing of higher marketing costs at the Hotel Group and increased information security costs at corporate. 
  Free cash flow increased to $754 million for the full year. Now excluding the one-time VAT refund and related interest income of $67 million, free cash flow normalized to $687 million for the year. As you know, I have said often that cash is the great enabler. We will use our significant free cash flow to support growth and build shareholder value. This will enable us to invest in the business, including acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We expect the deployment of cash flow, combined with the organic growth of our businesses, to generate annual earnings per share growth approximating 20% a year over the next 5 years. 
 
 As Steve noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which is a 32% payout at the midpoint of our 2012 net income guidance range. In addition, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter, spending $225 million. In 2012, through market close last evening, we purchased an additional 1.5 million shares for a total of $60 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. 
  
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's begin the segment review with our Hotel Group. Revenues are up 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Now a portion of that increase reflects a reporting reclassification of $15 million which had no impact on EBITDA. Excluding reclassifications, revenues were up 6% reflecting improved domestic RevPAR, and incremental revenues from our newly opened Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. 
  As mentioned earlier, we had non-cash writeoffs at the Hotel Group in the fourth quarter. Let me take a minute to walk you through the components of this non-cash charge. First, when we purchased the Wyndham brand in 2005, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to approximately 60 of the existing franchise and management contracts, creating an intangible asset on the balance sheet. The brand has evolved over the past 6 years and many of those original contracts are no longer in the system. As a result, we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately $14 million. We now have 100 hotels in the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts brand, and nearly 70% are new flags since acquisition.
Second, we have determined that we are unlikely to realize expected returns from investments at 3 managed properties, and we believe the prudent course is to write down the investments by approximately $30 million. These investments made at the height of the market were primarily related to development advances and management agreements. Now again, these are non-cash asset impairments. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% reflecting RevPAR improvement and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by the unfavorable timing of marketing costs, which we described in our third quarter call. RevPAR recovery continued in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 5%. Now in the U.S. fourth quarter RevPAR improved 8.4% versus a year ago, reflecting improvements in both occupancy and rate.
International RevPAR was down 3% due primarily to the rapid growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and some softness in Europe. We ended the year with 613,100 rooms in the system. Excluding the Corinthia and Ramada U.K. terminations, which we disclosed in the previous quarters, the system size increased by 1%. The pipelines sit at nearly 112,000 rooms at December 31, 2011, down slightly sequentially, reflecting strong room openings of close to 15,000 in quarter 4.
For the full year, contract signings were up 15% compared with 2010, and we executed 399 conversion deals compared with 363 deals in 2010, about a 10% increase.
Wyndham Exchange and Rentals did a great job of delivering their financial results despite FX headwinds and a difficult economic environment in Europe. Total revenue in constant currency was up 4% in the fourth quarter reflecting acquisitions, which contributed $14 million in incremental revenues. Excluding acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, revenue was flat. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of acquisitions in foreign currency. The impact of the acquisitions of Vacation Rental businesses, which have seasonally light sales in the fourth quarter, exacerbated quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Reflecting negative foreign exchange impact, exchange revenues decreased by 2% in the quarter. The average number of members was flat. In constant currency, exchange revenue and exchange revenue per member were also flat. 
  Vacation Rental revenues increased 10% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenue was flat, with average net price per rental up 5% and Vacation Rental transactions down 5%. This reflects active yield management offset by volume declines at our Dutch and U.K. businesses, consistent with the lower consumer confidence in those regions.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business once again delivered outstanding results. Revenues in EBITDA in the one in the fourth quarter of 2011 both increased 6% with tours up 8% and volume per guest up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. We also benefited from higher WAAM conditions. We made good progress in expanding our pool of lifetime buyers of vacation ownership. In 2011, we welcomed 27,000 new WV owners to the Wyndham family, that's a 23% increase compared with 2010 and has exceeded our goal for the year. Our property management business continued to contribute predictable recurring fee-for-service revenues in 2011, producing $56 million of EBITDA. Consumer finance revenues in the quarter were down slightly, reflecting the decrease in our contract receivable portfolio. And interest expense was flat. 
 
 Looking at portfolio performance, delinquency and default rates were flat. Accordingly, the provision for loan loss was flat and writeoffs during the fourth quarter were $75 million. As Steve mentioned, we signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal. Now the accounting for these transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet on a just-in-time basis. We'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Going forward, we will refer to this type of deal as WAAM/Just in Time. This arrangement will enable us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. 
  Now moving to corporate. Excluding legacy related items, corporate expenses were higher, primarily reflecting increased data security and higher employee-related- costs. Now let's turn to our 2012 guidance. We're going to post full guidance details including cash flow to our Investor Relations website following the call. To give you the highlights, revenue guidance remains at $4.4 billion  to $4.6 billion, up 4% to 8% from 2011, and EBITDA guidance remains at $1,030,000,000 to $1,055,000,000 up 6% to 8% from 2011. Because of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2012 to $2.85 to $3, with a diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares, which assumes no additional share repurchases in 2012.
Those ranges translate to approximately 18% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.56 per share. Now please note that as cash flow and share repurchase continue to be an important part of our investment thesis, we have considered whether to include share repurchase in our guidance assumptions. We've decided to adhere to our current practice of not doing so to allow for investment in our business, including acquisitions when opportunities present themselves. We view share repurchase as an attractive opportunity as well, of course, which we will weigh against M&A opportunities in our capital allocation decision process.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance at each of our business units, starting with the Hotel group. This year, our growth expectations for the lodging business reflect, in part, our decision to charge a higher licensing fee to our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand, which we believe has been of tremendous benefit to our timeshare business over the past few years. Additionally, we expect increased contributions from our recently completed Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando. Excluding these new items, the normalized EBITDA growth rate for the Hotel Group for 2012 would be 8% to 10%. In addition, we expect RevPAR to be up by 5% to 8%, and a 1% to 3% increase in system size. We expect revenues to be $835 million to $875 million and EBITDA in the range of $260 million to $270 million.
Moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. In exchange, we expect the average number of members to be flat to down 2%, primarily reflecting the loss of an affiliate with approximately 60,000 members. This affiliate's requests resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. We expect exchange revenue per member to be flat to up 2%, reflecting higher transaction pricing in other member-related revenue, offset by negative currency impacts.
In rentals, we expect transactions to be up 4% to 7% and average net price per Vacation Rentals to be flat to down 3%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Based on these drivers, we expect Wyndham Exchange and Rentals revenue of $1.44 billion to $1.51 billion, and EBITDA of $335 million to $355 million. Note that our growth expectations in Exchange and Rentals continues to be mid-single digits through 2015. The 2012 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange headwinds and the macro-environment challenges in Europe. 
  
Finally, moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect gross DOI sales to be up slightly from 2011 to $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, which includes approximately $120 million in gross WAAM sales, a 1% to 4% increase in tours as we target more new owners and a 2% to 5% increase in volume per guest. We expect total segment revenues of $2.15 billion to $2.225 billion, and EBITDA of $515 million to $540 million. Excluding the increased licensing fee to the Hotel group, we expect a normalized growth rate at vacation ownership in the mid-single digits.
Based on the improvements we've made to the credit standards and the performance of the portfolio, we are projecting that the provision for loan losses will continue to decline this year to $315 million to $335 million. Regarding our outlook for the ABS markets, 2011, of course, was our best year ever. We were able to obtain an average advance rate of 95% based on the quality of our portfolio and favorable market conditions. Each of our deals included a BB tranche. Going forward, we may choose not to access the BB market for each and every deal due to higher costs to secure investor demand. Accordingly, we expect 2012 advance rates to normalize in the high 80s.
We expect corporate expenses for the year of approximately $93 million to $100 million, primarily reflecting continued investment in information security and IT in general. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $185 million to $190 million, somewhat higher than 2011, reflecting the opening of our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and technology investments. We expect interest expense of approximately $135 million to $140 million. Now remember, our intention is to maintain a stable leverage ratio, which means our goal would be to add debt as we add EBITDA. Our interest expense guidance assumes our current debt profile. Any additional debt will incur, of course, additional interest expense, and we'll update our guidance when and if appropriate. 
 
 We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 38% consistent with 2011. We also expect to spend $195 million to $210 million in CapEx. This is slightly higher than our 5-year plan baseline, which is about $180 million to $200 million. We expect to get back to those levels in the next year or so. We expect to spend between $110 million and $120 million in timeshare development in 2012, up from the $80 million we disclosed in 2011, and closer to our projection of a $150 million average over the 5-year period starting in 2011.
Based on our current forecast, we expect free cash flow to be in the $600 million to $700 million range. With financing activities, we expect that 2012 available cash could be close to $1 billion. We will use that additional cash, of course, to invest in the business including M&A and a return to shareholders through additional share repurchase. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

First of all, the initiatives that we've put in place over the last several years, these Apollo initiatives that we've talked about, are really starting to kick in now. Our websites have been upgraded and they needed to be upgraded and they've been upgraded. And some of the other online initiatives will continue to drive traffic to those websites and we hope to convert and capture more. So I think that is one element of helping. The other element helping is our mix. As we add more Wyndham product, which we have a very good pipeline of, that Wyndham product comes at a higher RevPAR, so just the general mix of us should lift us above the average if you looked at just our component pieces. So that's really the reason for the RevPAR, what we think will be an outpaced RevPAR performance. And we've been doing very well in our online efforts. With respect to WAAM 2.0, or WAAM/Just in Time, that is a relatively manageable number for us, as we've told you in the past. We try to balance taking off of our balance sheet product, as well as taking advantage of a marketplace that's attractive right now. Do we think it could be more than the 15%? Over time, Joe, it definitely could be. The reception for this WAAM product that we're providing has been very strong from developers and banks who own the product. So I think we have a great kind of model that's out there. And now we have a year and a half of actually proving that it works well. The people that we do business with are very happy. We have repeat customers now in the WAAM world who want us to do more product with them. So I think that we have a great model to move that business more towards the asset light that we've talked about in the past becoming less asset dependent, taking down the balance sheet and increasing their ROIC on that business."

And so that's what's built into our guidance range. As it relates to hedging practices, we have as a philosophy that we act appropriately and modestly in our hedging and so we typically hedge a quarter out. And this year, we may do a little more to protect against the downside of a significant euro depreciation, but it's not going to be a material type of spend on our part. So Europe counts for about 15% of our business. That's where most of the FX movement takes place. So I think we're measured in our efforts to hedge against the euro or the pound sterling."

And then as we said in our organized comments, there was a timing of marketing-related costs that had a significant impact. If you recall, the chronology in 2011 in the first half of the year we cited the timing of marketing spend as an advantage to margin. In the second half of the year, we attributed some of the margin deterioration to the timing of marketing spend. So those are the 2 most important factors. We would expect that margins in 2011 will improve in our Hotel group as RevPAR increases and we keep expenses in check."

I'll take a first shot at answering them and then if I missed something, Tom can fill in. As for when the bookings are most heavily done, it's generally in the first and heavily in the second quarter. So it's the first half of the year, obviously teeing up for the summer. Booking windows have, in general, diminished. So they're definitely shortening. People are shopping around more, waiting for good deals, so to speak. And so we expect to be in the same kind of a pattern with maybe a little bit of a push to the later period for the bookings for this year. With respect to the U.K. situation, I can't say that we've seen much of an increase with the euro-pound trading, but again it's kind of early game here so it's a little hard to define exactly what will happen. We also have the Olympics over in London this year, as you know. We're not sure what the impact of that will be. And so we're watching it very carefully and watching the booking patterns to determine if we think there will be an impact and if we need to make any movement on pricing. And as for the long haul versus the short haul, I can't say that I've seen anything that has really directed that to be the issue. Some of our packaged deals to southern Europe have been a little bit lighter coming out of the U.K., but it's also a function of the booking window getting tighter because we may see more of it in the second quarter."

And historically, the business has been kind of that booking, as I said, has been spread over the first and second quarter. If I would try to guestimate for 2012 how much would that booking window slide, it would probably be measured in weeks not months, because you've got a bulk of the business all coming within, essentially, a 2-quarter period of time. So we're not suggesting that the booking is changing from being all in January to being all in June, but it's just sliding to be a tighter window towards that heavy summer travel. So depending on which market we're in, the inner Dutch market, for example, we saw a more dramatic tightening of the booking window in 2011 than we saw in 2010. The U.K. window in 2011 was not real dissimilar from 2010. So it really depends on market, but it's not a full quarter slide. It would be probably measured in weeks or a month, not multiple months."

As we've said in the past, most of what we have on our balance sheet, some of it is completely finished inventory and we're selling that. Some of it requires an additional capital spend in order to complete it for us to be able to sell it. So there's additional fresh capital go out to finish those projects. I think, and as we've said in the past, this is kind of one of those things that we're paid to do. We have to look at what's available out in the market, what we have on the balance sheet, the location of the inventory, the quality of the inventory, there's a lot of factors that go into it and this is a conversation that Tom and I have with the guys who run the timeshare business and our Chief Real Estate Officer on a regular basis. So there are situations where we feel that it's more advantageous to go into a market that we've been trying to get into for a while where the pricing hasn't been appropriate, where now we see that pricing available and  we say, ""Okay, well let's grab that market at some place that we feel like we need more product based on what our customers are telling us."" Because we ask them were would they like to go, where would they like to see more inventory. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. At the end of the day, we feel like we're doing an optimum job managing the capital allocation for inventory versus spending the finished building versus buying. And it's one of those things time will tell whether we've made good use of the capital. I think we're seeing the cost of sales go down, which is one of the results of being opportunistic out there in the market."

However, we've also said that we think that because of the business model we have and where we have our product, we will be stable in that market. And I think stable is the new up in that market. And so we're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned. And also, as we've shown in the past, we have always been resilient and able to adjust and adapt our model to whatever the market conditions are. So when we saw the decline in 2009, our businesses there grew. We shifted, we brought product in different locations and we managed to find growth in that market, which others were not seeing growth in. So we are calling for a stable euro out there.

One is the WAAM model -- and we said this before, I think actually before you were involved in our story. We talked about the WAAM model developing, and it's something that's existed for a while. We did a deal probably 5 years ago now during the peak of good times where we brought in product under a WAAM model. We didn't call it WAAM at the time because we weren't focused on that as a market initiative, we focused on that opportunity as just being opportunistic. We brought in a project in Panama City Beach, Florida and did it under this WAAM model. So the model has always been out there and available. I think even during good times there will be opportunities. And I think during the good times, it'll probably shift a little bit. It'll be away from the product that is on the market, that is weighing the market down right now with too much whole ownership condos. It'll shift to being developers who are now developing new product who are building a hotel, some whole ownership condos and they want also some timeshare product in the mix. And we will be a great partner for that person who wants to develop it. Timeshare owners spend time in their units, that's a fact, and they tend to spend more per stay on ancillary things like restaurants and theater tickets and other activities than a normal hotel stay does. And so the timeshare owner is a very attractive person to have in the mix of the development. So I think it shifts from being taking maybe what people are calling broken deals to becoming additive to other people's transactions over time."

So I think that if, again, you're asking a forward-looking statement, I think the agency model is where you'll see more work in the future. You'll see more agency model push versus the merchant model. But you really should be asking that question to the guys who are running that business as opposed to me.

First quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. Significantly, adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 36% and came in $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect strong operational performance in each of our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. We continue to successfully execute against our operating plans with strong performance across the company. Lodging and Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, excluding the inter segment license fee for the Wyndham brand name. 
In Lodging, RevPAR was up 7% with continued gains in both occupancy and rate. Vacation Ownership had an outstanding quarter supported by a strong consumer travel in the U.S. and continuing progress and optimizing marketing efficiencies. 
In exchange and rental, was highly effective in managing a difficult operating environment in Europe, as well as limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at a $1.30 per share, a 26% increase from the first quarter of last year. As you know, our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in our businesses at attractive returns and then to return the cash to shareholders. We continued delivering cash to shareholders again in the first quarter repurchasing $3.6 million of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 53% to $0.23 per share. 
In addition, this morning, we announced that our board has approved an additional $750 million to be added to our share repurchase authorization. Over the past few years, we have achieved shareholder returns in excess of the industry and market benchmarks due to: First, the strength of our largely fee-for-service business models; second, our proven ability to optimize all of our business through superior execution; third, our focus on growing free cash flow; and finally, our capital allocation that includes an increasing dividend and the repurchase our shares. 
We are very proud of what we've achieved, but we know that we have much to accomplish. As people in our office will tell you, my question usually is, what have you done for me lately? As management, it is our job to drive the growth of our business because the business without growth has diminishing value. 
So let me tell you why I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year and beyond. First, while we're cautious about Europe, we continue to see a global economic recovery in line with our expectations. We have 2 significant customer events earlier this month, our Global Hotel Convention and the American Resort Development Association or ARDA Conference. 
Our hotel convention, which is held every 18 months, brings together owners for all 15 of our widely known lodging brands. More than 5,000 owners and managers, as well as 130 suppliers were in attendance and we are able to get a very hands on read of the state of the global hotel industry. 
Since our last conference in September 2010, there's been an obvious improvement in the mood and outlook of our franchisees and partners. Many of our suppliers saw increased order and lead activity and almost without exception, the owners and managers I spoke with strongly felt that things were improving. 
And hotel owners are looking to invest in their hotels as well. So in addition to the numbers we are seeing, this is great confirmation that for us, the lodging and recovery is firmly established. 
The mood was positive at the ARDA Conference as well but a bit measured as the small to medium developers continue to have limited access to capital. Attendance at over 2,500 was strong and we were encouraged by the number of new developers both domestic and international. Interesting timeshare continues to grow around the world, which bodes well for RCI and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. 
As I mentioned earlier, the current economic environment in Europe is challenging our efforts to grow our Vacation Rentals businesses. We expect our European Vacation Rentals business to remain stable overall due to the strength and resilience of our portfolio of established brands and customer basis, as well as our strong experienced management teams. 
First quarter performance was consistent with these expectations and our full-year outlook for Europe remains unchanged. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make progress in executing its Apollo initiatives, which is a series of technology projects focused on improving our value proposition to franchisees. 
Our franchisees will be able to measure our results by the number of direct room nights we deliver to overall bookings, primarily through our online strategy. Our goal is to capture the maximum amount of online traffic and then convert these online visitors to staying guests. Remember that the launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first step in our Apollo plan to drive more room nights through our online direct distribution channels. 
Preliminary results have exceeded our expectations with brand booking increases averaging over 10%. As we discussed in the last call, in 2011, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 50% of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own brand sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information and ultimately book with us. We saw an approximate 30% increase in bookings during the pilot period. 
This past quarter, we rolled out TripAdvisor to the majority of our websites and will be fully implemented by the end of May. In conjunction with the rollout, we launched Wyn review, a suite of tools and services designed to help our franchisees manage their online ratings and reviews. We expect our affiliation with TripAdvisor, 1 of the first in the industry, to drive conversions, as well as support brand quality. 
We are also excited about our new mobile websites. By the end of next year, it is expected that more people will access the Internet using a mobile device than a computer. Research indicates that nearly 65% of mobile bookings are made on the day of our arrival, many within 5 miles of the hotel. 
Based on the narrow booking window of our consumers, as well as the distribution of our hotels, we feel this represents a significant opportunity for us to capture the on-road connect to traveler. We've designed our mobile sets with the end-user in mind providing a robust interface along with geographic search capabilities. We've made great progress and we believe we are among the leaders in the industry in these efforts. 
In addition to important initiatives like Apollo that drive our core business, we are pursuing a worldwide growth strategy that leverages our strong and diverse brand portfolio, as well as our global footprint. For example, last year, we had great success in leveraging relationships to pin multiunit deals and we expect an acceleration of those efforts this year. 
As we previously reported, to support the growth of our hotel system, we are planning to provide financing and other financial support over the next several years. 
Now, moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. I want to take a moment to commend that the Rentals steam, which despite the headwinds in Europe and a disappointing ski season in the U.S., grew revenues 3% and transactions 2% organically. The challenges in Europe were felt most significantly at the postseasons group in the U.K. While, which is in Denmark and Landolt in the Netherlands continue to post solid results. 
Well it's too early to get a clear red on the summer season, bookings and the shoulder seasons are ahead of last year, which is an encouraging sign. But as I said earlier, our outlook for European Rentals remains cautious for the year. We continue to make significant strides in our Vacation Rentals integration, which is key to our strategy to build a strong North American platform and gain market share, as well as improved margins in this rapidly growing industry. 
In the second quarter, we expect to launch 2 significant initiatives: First, in North America, we will consolidate 23 rental websites into a single improved site; second in Europe, we will integrate the inventory and reservation platform of our U.K. cottages, parts and lodges brands into a common property management system. A changes that will enable further yield management and operational efficiencies. 
RCI's commitment to providing the best tools in the industry to its members and affiliates was showcased at the ARDA convention. RCI was honored with 10 ARDA awards, including the coveted ACE Excellence in Customer Service Award. 
Coming on the heels of the major enhancements to RCI.com o0ver the past 18 months, including trading power transparency and new online search tools, RCI continues to innovate with the introduction of several new programs including online tour generation, which will provide affiliates with a new source of qualified sales prospects using RCI's robust platform for lead regeneration and sophisticated screening tools, and the timeshare online listening center, which is a social media monitoring command center providing our affiliates with a proactive service that protects and promotes their online brand reputations while improving customer service to our owners. 
The strength of RCI's technology continues to pay off with online transaction penetration growing to over 40%, up more than 400 basis points from last year. 
Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which is always -- which is also a recognized industry innovator. Results were stellar at WVO with volume per guest increases of 10% and tour increases of 8%. We're seeing great results from our latest initiative to drive efficiencies. Our credit prescreening program. 
As you know, timeshare is a sole rather than a sought product and finding good prospects is key to our success. So last year, we introduced a proprietary creditworthiness prescreening program. The roll out of this program is not effectively complete and it has increased our efficiency by identifying the most qualified prospects for our salespeople. 
We believe that the credit prescreening program was a meaningful contributor to the 10% lift in VPG and this will be another game changer for us in the industry. Great innovation, focused management and terrific execution delivered truly outstanding results at WVO. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. Developer interest is strong and we recently signed our first WAAM agreement for our WorldMark by Wyndham product. Located in the South Mountain region of Arizona near Scottsdale, our 5th WAAM deal is a purpose built timeshare project that will nicely complement our 3 existing Arizona locations within the WorldMark portfolio. We expect to start sales on this product in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"

First, I have a basic business philosophy that says, success is never final. The results of this quarter are now come up in the strategic initiatives in place of each business unit and the overall company initiatives that we continue to advance and refine over time. We had a terrific quarter as Steve said. With adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% ahead of first quarter 2011, and $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range, due to the strong execution at each of our business units and the benefit of share repurchases. 
As you know, we are focused on growing our free cash flow and deploying it effectively to enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow increased to $193 million or $1.30 per share, for the first  3 months in 2012 compared with $185 million or $1.03 per share during the same period in 2011. 
For the year, we expect that our available cash flow, which includes proceeds from our debt offerings, will be approximately $1 billion. We repurchased 3.6 million shares of stock in the first quarter of 2012 spending $150 million. 
Year-to-date through yesterday's market close, we have purchased a total of 4.4 million shares for $190 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return and with the $750 million increase, as of market close yesterday, we have $940 million available in our share repurchase program. 
Our capital allocation policy has been consistent since our launch as a public company in August 2006. First, we'll use our cash to invest in our businesses up to the point that the return is compelling. Second, we'll pursue accretive fee-for-service acquisitions in our core businesses such hotel and vacation rental. And then finally, we'll distribute cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Now before we get to our operating performance for the quarter, let's review our recent capital markets activity. We completed a number of transactions and pushed out terms that are unsecured debt financings at record low interest rates. We believe that these actions strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, while maintaining an overall investment grade credit profile. 
So first, we completed a $650 million tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2014 and 2016. Our 2014 notes carry a coupon rate of 9 and 7 8s and we were able to bring down our notes coming due in 2016 from $800 million to $357 million. 
These notes were replaced with the issuance of $950 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 and 10 years, with a weighted-average coupon of 3.84%. We also reduced our revolver borrowings by approximately $170 million. The combined impact of these transactions increased our unsecured debt outstanding by over $125 million. Now that's consistent with our plan to maintain the leverage as our EBITDA increases. 
We will use the extra funds for our strategic initiatives and share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation policy. The debt repurchase resulted in a pretax charge of $106 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2012 adjusted results. 
In addition, even with our $125 million increase in debt, our net interest expense will decrease by approximately $10 million in 2012 or $13 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to the ABS markets. Last month, we announced the $450 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 87.5% and a weighted average coupon of 3%. Another record low. As expected, the advanced rate was lower than our 2011 transactions, as a direct result of our decision to opt for a lower overall coupon rate. 
Had the opted to issue a double B charge similar to our deals in 2011, our advance rate would have been higher but so with our overall coupon rate. We believe we've hit the sweet spot of the current ABS markets combining a record low coupon with a slightly lower but still very attractive advanced rate. 
Now moving to the operational performance through the quarter, let's begin the segment review with our Hotel group. Revenues were up 24% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase reflects RevPAR improvement, incremental revenue from the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando, and higher revenue from licensing fees charged to the company's Vacation Ownership business. The revenue also includes -- the revenue increase includes a $10 million increase reporting qualification, which had no impact on EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 23% largely reflecting RevPAR increases. The recently opened Orlando Hotel and incremental intersegment licensing fees offset by higher marketing costs. 
Systemwide RevPAR increased 7% in the first quarter but domestic RevPAR improved 9%, reflecting roughly equal gains domestically in both occupancy and average daily rate. 
International RevPAR was up 3% lead by favorable performance in our Asia-Pacific region primarily China, while European RevPAR slowed somewhat. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,300 hotels worldwide, flat compared to the same period last year. 
The pipeline at March 31 sit at nearly 108,200 rooms, up 6% over the last year. For the first quarter, we added over 220 new deals to the pipeline, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's take a look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. The business unit demonstrated great resiliency in the face of difficult economic environment in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Segment revenues were $361 million in the first quarter compared to $356 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquisition-related revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues were flat. Exchange revenues decreased 3% in the quarter or 2% in constant currency compared with the same period of 2011. This reflects a 2% decline in our average number of members due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement, which would have resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. 
Exchange revenue per member was flat in the quarter compared with the same period in 2011. Vacation Rentals rental revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rentals revenues increased 3%. 
Organic transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2012 were up 2% compared with the first quarter of the. Driven by the growth at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses as well as our ResortQuest business in the U.S., this was partially offset by a decline in volume at our postseasons group business in the U.K. due to weak economic conditions. 
Average net price per rental was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year. Overall, adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter compared with the same period of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA was down 2% reflecting the economic challenges in Europe. 
Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared with the prior year, segment revenues increased 11% reflecting increased VOI sales. Towards were up 8% driven the improving efficiencies and volume per guest was up a robust 10%, reflecting the positive impact from our credit prescreening program, improved close rates and enhanced product offerings, which drove an increase in the average amount purchase per owner. We expect VPG growth to moderate somewhat throughout the year, as we lap the rollout of the credit prescreening program. 
Consistent with last year, we expect to add 27,000 new owners in 2012. In our WAAM business, commissions were up as we shifted the mix of sales to the new WAAM deals with higher commission rates. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, 2012 was $103 million, up 7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher inner segment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham Grand tradename, adjusted EBITDA would have been double-digit at 11%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continued to improve although at a slower rate than we would like. Writeoffs during the first quarter were $80 million down from $85 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $96 million compared with $79 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales but also the limited improvement in portfolio performance. On a relative to sales basis, the provision was flat compared to last year. 
Finally, corporate expenses as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year. Now let me spend a few moments on guidance. Assuming no additional debt transactions, we expect our interest expense to decline for the full year from $135 million to $140 million to $120 million to $125million, reflecting our first quarter capital market transactions. 
As a result of this lower interest expense and the first quarter share repurchases only, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.85 to $3 to $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 149 million shares down from our original guidance of 153 million shares. 
Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond March 31. Our 2012 EBITDA, revenue and driver guidance remain unchanged. 
Finally, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.85 per share based on a diluted share count of 148 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Can you just sort of give us some sense -- in the beginning of your commentary, you said that you were seeing improving travel trends. And then in the past when the travel trends have improved, you have sometimes accelerated your timeshare sales by design. Do you now feel that you have right timeshare sales range balancing quality of customer, lack of CapEx needs, sort of with the right growth rate? So if you could answer that question. Then, Tom, could you talk a little bit about the stock prices, how a good move, are you becoming more price sensitive on repurchasing shares? Where do you come out on that?"

The improving travel trends converging into more timeshare sales is a positive. You're actually right, Steve to give may have had some impact on the fact that to flow was up above our guidance range. But also contributing to it is the credit prescreening program that we're using now and other marketing efficiencies and we brought to bear so it's hard to separate how many more people are beginning because of the improved travel. We know that our timeshare resorts are slightly more occupied than in 2011 than they were in 2012 and that trend seems to be working in our favor. More people in our timeshare resorts mean that there are more people stop to about adding more product to their portfolio so by more of our points. So there is a benefit to it, Steve, it is ever question. But I can't kind of tease apart of the pieces because you got a lot of things are moving to try to drive efficiency in our sales process. We are not pushing timeshare harder though to kind of part of your point. It's not like the accelerator down harmful of the timeshare sales as we've said, we'd like to keep that to a mid-single-digit snarly bidding that continually because this is a versus running very fast and efficiently and we're not going to stop it or slow it down but we're not feeling it anymore capital so the horses running at high speed without requiring animal capital. Were happy with that. And what is what you're talking about is greater travel trends, more people traveling into our land and is there more people we can meet at our marketing offsite offices to bring them into take tours, but we limit the number of tours. So I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming factor. So the answer to a short question, but there's a lot involved in that dynamic that you identified."

We're starting the year with great momentum. First quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%.

First quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. Significantly, adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 36% and came in $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect strong operational performance in each of our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. We continue to successfully execute against our operating plans with strong performance across the company. Lodging and Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, excluding the inter segment license fee for the Wyndham brand name. 
In Lodging, RevPAR was up 7% with continued gains in both occupancy and rate. Vacation Ownership had an outstanding quarter supported by a strong consumer travel in the U.S. and continuing progress and optimizing marketing efficiencies. 
In exchange and rental, was highly effective in managing a difficult operating environment in Europe, as well as limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at a $1.30 per share, a 26% increase from the first quarter of last year. As you know, our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in our businesses at attractive returns and then to return the cash to shareholders. We continued delivering cash to shareholders again in the first quarter repurchasing $3.6 million of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 53% to $0.23 per share. 
In addition, this morning, we announced that our board has approved an additional $750 million to be added to our share repurchase authorization. Over the past few years, we have achieved shareholder returns in excess of the industry and market benchmarks due to: First, the strength of our largely fee-for-service business models; second, our proven ability to optimize all of our business through superior execution; third, our focus on growing free cash flow; and finally, our capital allocation that includes an increasing dividend and the repurchase our shares. 
We are very proud of what we've achieved, but we know that we have much to accomplish. As people in our office will tell you, my question usually is, what have you done for me lately? As management, it is our job to drive the growth of our business because the business without growth has diminishing value. 
So let me tell you why I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year and beyond. First, while we're cautious about Europe, we continue to see a global economic recovery in line with our expectations. We have 2 significant customer events earlier this month, our Global Hotel Convention and the American Resort Development Association or ARDA Conference. 
Our hotel convention, which is held every 18 months, brings together owners for all 15 of our widely known lodging brands. More than 5,000 owners and managers, as well as 130 suppliers were in attendance and we are able to get a very hands on read of the state of the global hotel industry. 
Since our last conference in September 2010, there's been an obvious improvement in the mood and outlook of our franchisees and partners. Many of our suppliers saw increased order and lead activity and almost without exception, the owners and managers I spoke with strongly felt that things were improving. 
And hotel owners are looking to invest in their hotels as well. So in addition to the numbers we are seeing, this is great confirmation that for us, the lodging and recovery is firmly established. 
The mood was positive at the ARDA Conference as well but a bit measured as the small to medium developers continue to have limited access to capital. Attendance at over 2,500 was strong and we were encouraged by the number of new developers both domestic and international. Interesting timeshare continues to grow around the world, which bodes well for RCI and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. 
As I mentioned earlier, the current economic environment in Europe is challenging our efforts to grow our Vacation Rentals businesses. We expect our European Vacation Rentals business to remain stable overall due to the strength and resilience of our portfolio of established brands and customer basis, as well as our strong experienced management teams. 
First quarter performance was consistent with these expectations and our full-year outlook for Europe remains unchanged. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on progress in our business units in the first quarter. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make progress in executing its Apollo initiatives, which is a series of technology projects focused on improving our value proposition to franchisees. 
Our franchisees will be able to measure our results by the number of direct room nights we deliver to overall bookings, primarily through our online strategy. Our goal is to capture the maximum amount of online traffic and then convert these online visitors to staying guests. Remember that the launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first step in our Apollo plan to drive more room nights through our online direct distribution channels. 
Preliminary results have exceeded our expectations with brand booking increases averaging over 10%. As we discussed in the last call, in 2011, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 50% of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own brand sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information and ultimately book with us. We saw an approximate 30% increase in bookings during the pilot period. 
This past quarter, we rolled out TripAdvisor to the majority of our websites and will be fully implemented by the end of May. In conjunction with the rollout, we launched Wyn review, a suite of tools and services designed to help our franchisees manage their online ratings and reviews. We expect our affiliation with TripAdvisor, 1 of the first in the industry, to drive conversions, as well as support brand quality. 
We are also excited about our new mobile websites. By the end of next year, it is expected that more people will access the Internet using a mobile device than a computer. Research indicates that nearly 65% of mobile bookings are made on the day of our arrival, many within 5 miles of the hotel. 
Based on the narrow booking window of our consumers, as well as the distribution of our hotels, we feel this represents a significant opportunity for us to capture the on-road connect to traveler. We've designed our mobile sets with the end-user in mind providing a robust interface along with geographic search capabilities. We've made great progress and we believe we are among the leaders in the industry in these efforts. 
In addition to important initiatives like Apollo that drive our core business, we are pursuing a worldwide growth strategy that leverages our strong and diverse brand portfolio, as well as our global footprint. For example, last year, we had great success in leveraging relationships to pin multiunit deals and we expect an acceleration of those efforts this year. 
As we previously reported, to support the growth of our hotel system, we are planning to provide financing and other financial support over the next several years. 
Now, moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. I want to take a moment to commend that the Rentals steam, which despite the headwinds in Europe and a disappointing ski season in the U.S., grew revenues 3% and transactions 2% organically. The challenges in Europe were felt most significantly at the postseasons group in the U.K. While, which is in Denmark and Landolt in the Netherlands continue to post solid results. 
Well it's too early to get a clear red on the summer season, bookings and the shoulder seasons are ahead of last year, which is an encouraging sign. But as I said earlier, our outlook for European Rentals remains cautious for the year. We continue to make significant strides in our Vacation Rentals integration, which is key to our strategy to build a strong North American platform and gain market share, as well as improved margins in this rapidly growing industry. 
In the second quarter, we expect to launch 2 significant initiatives: First, in North America, we will consolidate 23 rental websites into a single improved site; second in Europe, we will integrate the inventory and reservation platform of our U.K. cottages, parts and lodges brands into a common property management system. A changes that will enable further yield management and operational efficiencies. 
RCI's commitment to providing the best tools in the industry to its members and affiliates was showcased at the ARDA convention. RCI was honored with 10 ARDA awards, including the coveted ACE Excellence in Customer Service Award. 
Coming on the heels of the major enhancements to RCI.com o0ver the past 18 months, including trading power transparency and new online search tools, RCI continues to innovate with the introduction of several new programs including online tour generation, which will provide affiliates with a new source of qualified sales prospects using RCI's robust platform for lead regeneration and sophisticated screening tools, and the timeshare online listening center, which is a social media monitoring command center providing our affiliates with a proactive service that protects and promotes their online brand reputations while improving customer service to our owners. 
The strength of RCI's technology continues to pay off with online transaction penetration growing to over 40%, up more than 400 basis points from last year. 
Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which is always -- which is also a recognized industry innovator. Results were stellar at WVO with volume per guest increases of 10% and tour increases of 8%. We're seeing great results from our latest initiative to drive efficiencies. Our credit prescreening program. 
As you know, timeshare is a sole rather than a sought product and finding good prospects is key to our success. So last year, we introduced a proprietary creditworthiness prescreening program. The roll out of this program is not effectively complete and it has increased our efficiency by identifying the most qualified prospects for our salespeople. 
We believe that the credit prescreening program was a meaningful contributor to the 10% lift in VPG and this will be another game changer for us in the industry. Great innovation, focused management and terrific execution delivered truly outstanding results at WVO. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. Developer interest is strong and we recently signed our first WAAM agreement for our WorldMark by Wyndham product. Located in the South Mountain region of Arizona near Scottsdale, our 5th WAAM deal is a purpose built timeshare project that will nicely complement our 3 existing Arizona locations within the WorldMark portfolio. We expect to start sales on this product in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"

First, I have a basic business philosophy that says, success is never final. The results of this quarter are now come up in the strategic initiatives in place of each business unit and the overall company initiatives that we continue to advance and refine over time. We had a terrific quarter as Steve said. With adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% ahead of first quarter 2011, and $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range, due to the strong execution at each of our business units and the benefit of share repurchases. 
As you know, we are focused on growing our free cash flow and deploying it effectively to enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow increased to $193 million or $1.30 per share, for the first  3 months in 2012 compared with $185 million or $1.03 per share during the same period in 2011. 
For the year, we expect that our available cash flow, which includes proceeds from our debt offerings, will be approximately $1 billion. We repurchased 3.6 million shares of stock in the first quarter of 2012 spending $150 million. 
Year-to-date through yesterday's market close, we have purchased a total of 4.4 million shares for $190 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return and with the $750 million increase, as of market close yesterday, we have $940 million available in our share repurchase program. 
Our capital allocation policy has been consistent since our launch as a public company in August 2006. First, we'll use our cash to invest in our businesses up to the point that the return is compelling. Second, we'll pursue accretive fee-for-service acquisitions in our core businesses such hotel and vacation rental. And then finally, we'll distribute cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Now before we get to our operating performance for the quarter, let's review our recent capital markets activity. We completed a number of transactions and pushed out terms that are unsecured debt financings at record low interest rates. We believe that these actions strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, while maintaining an overall investment grade credit profile. 
So first, we completed a $650 million tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2014 and 2016. Our 2014 notes carry a coupon rate of 9 and 7 8s and we were able to bring down our notes coming due in 2016 from $800 million to $357 million. 
These notes were replaced with the issuance of $950 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 and 10 years, with a weighted-average coupon of 3.84%. We also reduced our revolver borrowings by approximately $170 million. The combined impact of these transactions increased our unsecured debt outstanding by over $125 million. Now that's consistent with our plan to maintain the leverage as our EBITDA increases. 
We will use the extra funds for our strategic initiatives and share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation policy. The debt repurchase resulted in a pretax charge of $106 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2012 adjusted results. 
In addition, even with our $125 million increase in debt, our net interest expense will decrease by approximately $10 million in 2012 or $13 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to the ABS markets. Last month, we announced the $450 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 87.5% and a weighted average coupon of 3%. Another record low. As expected, the advanced rate was lower than our 2011 transactions, as a direct result of our decision to opt for a lower overall coupon rate. 
Had the opted to issue a double B charge similar to our deals in 2011, our advance rate would have been higher but so with our overall coupon rate. We believe we've hit the sweet spot of the current ABS markets combining a record low coupon with a slightly lower but still very attractive advanced rate. 
Now moving to the operational performance through the quarter, let's begin the segment review with our Hotel group. Revenues were up 24% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase reflects RevPAR improvement, incremental revenue from the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando, and higher revenue from licensing fees charged to the company's Vacation Ownership business. The revenue also includes -- the revenue increase includes a $10 million increase reporting qualification, which had no impact on EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 23% largely reflecting RevPAR increases. The recently opened Orlando Hotel and incremental intersegment licensing fees offset by higher marketing costs. 
Systemwide RevPAR increased 7% in the first quarter but domestic RevPAR improved 9%, reflecting roughly equal gains domestically in both occupancy and average daily rate. 
International RevPAR was up 3% lead by favorable performance in our Asia-Pacific region primarily China, while European RevPAR slowed somewhat. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,300 hotels worldwide, flat compared to the same period last year. 
The pipeline at March 31 sit at nearly 108,200 rooms, up 6% over the last year. For the first quarter, we added over 220 new deals to the pipeline, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's take a look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. The business unit demonstrated great resiliency in the face of difficult economic environment in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Segment revenues were $361 million in the first quarter compared to $356 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquisition-related revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues were flat. Exchange revenues decreased 3% in the quarter or 2% in constant currency compared with the same period of 2011. This reflects a 2% decline in our average number of members due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement, which would have resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. 
Exchange revenue per member was flat in the quarter compared with the same period in 2011. Vacation Rentals rental revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rentals revenues increased 3%. 
Organic transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2012 were up 2% compared with the first quarter of the. Driven by the growth at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks businesses as well as our ResortQuest business in the U.S., this was partially offset by a decline in volume at our postseasons group business in the U.K. due to weak economic conditions. 
Average net price per rental was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year. Overall, adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter compared with the same period of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA was down 2% reflecting the economic challenges in Europe. 
Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared with the prior year, segment revenues increased 11% reflecting increased VOI sales. Towards were up 8% driven the improving efficiencies and volume per guest was up a robust 10%, reflecting the positive impact from our credit prescreening program, improved close rates and enhanced product offerings, which drove an increase in the average amount purchase per owner. We expect VPG growth to moderate somewhat throughout the year, as we lap the rollout of the credit prescreening program. 
Consistent with last year, we expect to add 27,000 new owners in 2012. In our WAAM business, commissions were up as we shifted the mix of sales to the new WAAM deals with higher commission rates. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, 2012 was $103 million, up 7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher inner segment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham Grand tradename, adjusted EBITDA would have been double-digit at 11%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continued to improve although at a slower rate than we would like. Writeoffs during the first quarter were $80 million down from $85 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $96 million compared with $79 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales but also the limited improvement in portfolio performance. On a relative to sales basis, the provision was flat compared to last year. 
Finally, corporate expenses as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year. Now let me spend a few moments on guidance. Assuming no additional debt transactions, we expect our interest expense to decline for the full year from $135 million to $140 million to $120 million to $125million, reflecting our first quarter capital market transactions. 
As a result of this lower interest expense and the first quarter share repurchases only, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.85 to $3 to $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 149 million shares down from our original guidance of 153 million shares. 
Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond March 31. Our 2012 EBITDA, revenue and driver guidance remain unchanged. 
Finally, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.85 per share based on a diluted share count of 148 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

The improving travel trends converging into more timeshare sales is a positive. You're actually right, Steve to give may have had some impact on the fact that to flow was up above our guidance range. But also contributing to it is the credit prescreening program that we're using now and other marketing efficiencies and we brought to bear so it's hard to separate how many more people are beginning because of the improved travel. We know that our timeshare resorts are slightly more occupied than in 2011 than they were in 2012 and that trend seems to be working in our favor. More people in our timeshare resorts mean that there are more people stop to about adding more product to their portfolio so by more of our points. So there is a benefit to it, Steve, it is ever question. But I can't kind of tease apart of the pieces because you got a lot of things are moving to try to drive efficiency in our sales process. We are not pushing timeshare harder though to kind of part of your point. It's not like the accelerator down harmful of the timeshare sales as we've said, we'd like to keep that to a mid-single-digit snarly bidding that continually because this is a versus running very fast and efficiently and we're not going to stop it or slow it down but we're not feeling it anymore capital so the horses running at high speed without requiring animal capital. Were happy with that. And what is what you're talking about is greater travel trends, more people traveling into our land and is there more people we can meet at our marketing offsite offices to bring them into take tours, but we limit the number of tours. So I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming factor. So the answer to a short question, but there's a lot involved in that dynamic that you identified."

U.K. definitely the most challenged of the markets over there. And but probably the best performing market I would say is Denmark. With the Chairman and the consumer and the Spanish and Italian.

We're starting the year with great momentum. First quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%.

First quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. Significantly, adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 36% and came in $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect strong operational performance in each of our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. We continue to successfully execute against our operating plans with strong performance across the company. Lodging and Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, excluding the intersegment license fee for the Wyndham Grand name. 
In Lodging, RevPAR was up 7% with continued gains in both occupancy and rate. Vacation Ownership had an outstanding quarter supported by a strong consumer travel in the U.S. and continuing progress in optimizing marketing efficiencies. 
And Exchange and Rental was highly effective in managing a difficult operating environment in Europe, as well as limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at $1.30 per share, a 26% increase from the first quarter of last year. As you know, our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in our businesses at attractive returns and then to return the cash to shareholders. We continued delivering cash to shareholders again in the first quarter, repurchasing $3.6 million of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 53% to $0.23 per share. 
In addition, this morning, we announced that our Board has approved an additional $750 million to be added to our share repurchase authorization. Over the past few years, we have achieved shareholder returns in excess of the industry and market benchmarks due to: First, the strength of our largely fee-for-service business models; second, our proven ability to optimize all of our businesses through superior execution; third, our focus on growing free cash flow; and finally, our capital allocation that includes an increasing dividend and the repurchase our shares. 
We are very proud of what we've achieved, but we know that we have much to accomplish. As people in our office would tell you, my question usually is, what have you done for me lately? As management, it is our job to drive the growth of our business because a business without growth has diminishing value. 
So let me tell you why I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year and beyond. First, while we're cautious about the euro, we continue to see a global economic recovery in line with our expectations. We have 2 significant customer events earlier this month, our Global Hotel Convention and the American Resort Development Association or ARDA Conference. 
Our hotel convention, which is held every 18 months, brings together owners for all 15 of our widely known lodging brands. More than 5,000 owners and managers, as well as 130 suppliers were in attendance and we are able to get a very hands-on read of the state of the global hotel industry. 
Since our last conference in September of 2010, there's been an obvious improvement in the mood and outlook of our franchisees and partners. Many of our suppliers saw increased order and lead activity and almost without exception, the owners and managers I spoke with strongly felt that things were improving. 
And hotel owners are looking to invest in their hotels as well. So in addition to the numbers we are seeing, this is great confirmation that for us, the lodging and recovery is firmly established. 
The mood was positive at the ARDA Conference as well but a bit measured as the small to medium developers continue to have limited access to capital. Attendance at over 2,500 was strong and we were encouraged by the number of new developers both domestic and international. Interesting timeshare continues to grow around the world, which bodes well for RCI and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. 
As I mentioned earlier, the current economic environment in Europe is challenging our efforts to grow our Vacation Rental businesses. We expect our European Vacation Rental business to remain stable overall due to the strength and resiliency of our portfolio of established brands and customer basis, as well as our strong, experienced management teams. 
First quarter performance was consistent with these expectations and our full-year outlook for Europe remains unchanged. 
Let me now spend a few moments to give you an update on the progress in our business units in the first quarter. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make progress in executing its Apollo initiatives, which is a series of technology projects focused on improving our value proposition to franchisees. 
Our franchisees will be able to measure our results by the number of direct room nights we deliver to overall bookings, primarily through our online strategy. Our goal is to capture the maximum amount of online traffic and then convert these online visitors to staying guests. Remember that the launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first step in our Apollo plan to drive more room nights through our online direct distribution channels. 
Preliminary results have exceeded our expectations with brand booking increases averaging over 10%. As we discussed in the last call, in 2011, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 50% of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own brand sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information and ultimately book with us. We saw an approximate 30% increase in bookings during the pilot period. 
This past quarter, we rolled out TripAdvisor to the majority of our websites and will be fully implemented by the end of May. In conjunction with the rollout, we launched Wyn Review, a suite of tools and services designed to help our franchisees manage their online ratings and reviews. We expect our affiliation with TripAdvisor, one of the first in the industry, to drive conversions, as well as support brand quality. 
We are also excited about our new mobile websites. By the end of next year, it is expected that more people will access the Internet using a mobile device than a computer. Research indicates that nearly 65% of mobile bookings are made on the day of arrival, many within 5 miles of the hotel. 
Based on the narrow booking window of our consumers, as well as the distribution of our hotels, we feel this represents a significant opportunity for us to capture the on-road connect to traveler. We've designed our mobile sites with the end-user in mind, providing a robust interface along with geographic search capabilities. We've made great progress and we believe we are among the leaders in the industry in these efforts. 
In addition to important initiatives like Apollo that drive our core business, we are pursuing a worldwide growth strategy that leverages our strong and diverse brand portfolio, as well as our global footprint. For example, last year, we had great success in leveraging relationships to pin multi-unit deals, and we expect an acceleration of those efforts this year. 
As we previously reported, to support the growth of our hotel system, we are planning to provide mezzanine financing and other financial support over the next several years. 
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. I want to take a moment to commend the Rentals steam, which despite the headwinds in Europe and a disappointing ski season in the U.S., grew revenues 3% and transactions 2% organically. The challenges in Europe were felt most significantly at the Hoseasons Group in the U.K., while Novasol, which is in Denmark, and Landal, in the Netherlands, continue to post solid results. 
While it's too early to get a clear read on the summer season, bookings in the shoulder seasons are ahead of last year, which is an encouraging sign. But as I said earlier, our outlook for European rentals remains cautious for the year. We continue to make significant strides in our Vacation Rentals integration, which is key to our strategy to build a strong North American platform and gain market share, as well as improve margins in this rapidly growing industry. 
In the second quarter, we expect to launch 2 significant initiatives: First, in North America, we will consolidate 23 rental websites into a single improved site; second in Europe, we will integrate the inventory and reservation platform of our U.K. cottages, parks and lodges brands into a common property management system. A change that will enable further yield management and operational efficiencies. 
RCI's commitment to providing the best tools in the industry to its members and affiliates was showcased at the ARDA convention. RCI was honored with 10 ARDA awards, including the coveted ACE Excellence in Customer Service Award. 
Coming on the heels are the major enhancements to rci.com over the past 18 months, including trading power transparency and new online search tools, RCI continues to innovate with the introduction of several new programs, including online tour generation, which will provide affiliates with a new source of qualified sales prospects using RCI's robust platform for lead regeneration and sophisticated screening tools, and the timeshare online listening center, which is a social media monitoring command center providing our affiliates with a proactive service that protects and promotes their online brand reputations while improving customer service to our owners. 
The strength of RCI's technology continues to pay off with online transaction penetration growing to over 40%, up more than 400 basis points from last year. Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which is always -- which is also a recognized industry innovator. Results were stellar at WVO with volume per guest increases of 10% and tour increases of 8%. We're seeing great results from our latest initiative to drive efficiencies, our credit prescreening program. As you know, timeshare is a sold rather than a sought product, and finding good prospects is key to our success. So last year, we introduced the proprietary creditworthiness prescreening program. The rollout of this program is now effectively complete, and it has increased our efficiency by identifying the most qualified prospects for our salespeople. 
We believe that the credit prescreening program was a meaningful contributor to the 10% lift in VPG and that this will be another game changer for us in the industry. Great innovation, focused management and terrific execution delivered truly outstanding results at WVO. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. Developer interest is strong and we recently signed our first WAAM agreement for our WorldMark by Wyndham product. Located in the south mountain region of Arizona near Scottsdale, our 5th WAAM deal is a purpose-built timeshare project that will nicely complement our 3 existing Arizona locations within the WorldMark portfolio. We expect to start sales on this product in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"

Let me start with some brief comments on the business overall, and then add some perspective to the quarter's results. First, I have a basic business philosophy that says, success is never final. The results of this quarter are an outcome",1611,"Thanks, Steve. Let me start with some brief comments on the business overall, and then add some perspective to the quarter's results. 
First, I have a basic business philosophy that says, success is never final. The results of this quarter are an outcome of the strategic initiatives in place at each business unit and the overall company initiatives that we continue to advance and refine over time. We had a terrific quarter as Steve said. With adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% ahead of first quarter 2011, and $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range, due to the strong execution at each of our business units and the benefit of share repurchases. 
Well, as you know, we are focused on growing our free cash flow and deploying it effectively to enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow increased to $193 million or $1.30 per share for the first  3 months in 2012 compared with $185 million or $1.03 per share during the same period in 2011. 
For the year, we expect that our available cash flow, which includes proceeds from our debt offerings, will be approximately $1 billion. We repurchased 3.6 million shares of stock in the first quarter of 2012, spending $150 million. 
Year-to-date through yesterday's market close, we have purchased a total of 4.4 million shares for $190 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. And with the $750 million increase, as of market close yesterday, we have $940 million available in our share repurchase program. 
Our capital allocation policy has been consistent since our launch as a public company in August 2006. First, we'll use our cash to invest in our businesses up to the point that the return is compelling. Second, we'll pursue accretive fee-for-service acquisitions in our core businesses such Hotel and Vacation Rental. And then finally, we'll distribute cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Now before we get to our operating performance for the quarter, let's review our recent capital markets activity. We completed a number of transactions and pushed out terms on our unsecured debt financings at record low interest rates. We believe that these actions strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, while maintaining an overall investment-grade credit profile. 
So first, we completed a $650 million tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2014 and 2016. Our 2014 notes carry the coupon rate of 9 and 7/8 and we were able to bring down our notes coming due in 2016 from $800 million to $357 million. 
These notes were replaced with the issuance of $950 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 and 10 years, with a weighted-average coupon of 3.84%. We also reduced our revolver borrowings by approximately $170 million. The combined impact of these transactions increased our unsecured debt outstanding by over $125 million. Now that's consistent with our plan to maintain leverage as our EBITDA increases. 
We will use the extra funds for our strategic initiatives and share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation policy. The debt repurchase resulted in a pretax charge of $106 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2012 adjusted results. 
In addition, even with our $125 million increase in debt, our net interest expense will decrease by approximately $10 million in 2012 or $13 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to the ABS markets. Last month, we announced the $450 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 87.5% and a weighted average coupon of 3%, another record low. As expected, the advanced rate was lower than our 2011 transactions, as a direct result of our decision to opt for a lower overall coupon rate. 
Had we opted to issue a BB tranche, similar to our deals in 2011, our advance rate would have been higher but so would our overall coupon rate. We believe we've hit the sweet spot of the current ABS markets, combining a record low coupon with a slightly lower but still very attractive advanced rate. 
Now moving to the operational performance through the quarter, let's begin the segment review with our Hotel group. Revenues were up 24% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase reflects RevPAR improvement, incremental revenue from the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando, and higher revenue from licensing fees charged to the company's Vacation Ownership business. The revenue also includes -- the revenue increase also includes a $10 million increase reporting clarification, which had no impact on EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 23%, largely reflecting RevPAR increases. The recently opened Orlando Hotel and incremental intersegment licensing fees offset by higher marketing cost. 
Systemwide RevPAR increased 7% in the first quarter, but domestic RevPAR improved 9%, reflecting roughly equal gains domestically in both occupancy and average daily rate. 
International RevPAR was up 3%, lead by favorable performance in our Asia-Pacific region, primarily China, while European RevPAR have slowed somewhat. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,300 hotels worldwide, flat compared to the same period last year. 
The pipeline at March 31 sit at nearly 108,200 rooms, up 6% over the last year. For the first quarter, we added over 220 new deals to the pipeline, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's take a look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. The business unit demonstrated great resiliency in the face of difficult economic environment in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Segment revenues were $361 million in the first quarter compared to $356 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquisition-related revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues were flat. Exchange revenues decreased 3% in the quarter or 2% in constant currency compared with the same period of 2011. This reflects a 2% decline in our average number of members due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement, which would have resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. 
Exchange revenue per member was flat in the quarter compared with the same period in 2011. Vacation Rental revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues increased 3%. 
Organic transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2012 were up 2% compared with the first quarter of 2011, driven by the growth at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks business as well as our ResortQuest business in the U.S. This was partially offset by a decline in volume at our Hoseasons Group business in the U.K. due to weak economic conditions. 
Average net price per rental was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year. Overall, adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter compared with the same period of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, reflecting the economic challenges in Europe. 
Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared with the prior year, segment revenues increased 11%, reflecting increased VOI sales. Tours were up 8% driven by improving efficiencies and volume per guest was up a robust 10%, reflecting the positive impact from our credit prescreening program, improved close rates and enhanced product offerings, which drove an increase in the average amount purchase per owner. We expect VPG growth to moderate somewhat throughout the year as we lap the rollout of the credit prescreening program. 
Consistent with last year, we expect to add 27,000 new owners in 2012. In our WAAM business, commissions were up as we shifted the mix of sales to the new WAAM deals with higher commission rates. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 was $103 million, up 7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham Grand tradename, adjusted EBITDA would have been double-digit at 11%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve although at a slower rate than we would like. Writeoffs during the first quarter were $80 million down from $85 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $96 million compared with $79 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales but also the limited improvement in portfolio performance. On a relative to sales basis, the provision was flat compared to last year. 
Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year. Now let me spend a few moments on guidance. Assuming no additional debt transactions, we expect our interest expense to decline for the full year from $135 million to $140 million, to $120 million to $125million, reflecting our first quarter capital market transactions. 
As a result of this lower interest expense and the first quarter share repurchases only, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.85 to $3, to $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 149 million shares, down from our original guidance of 153 million shares. 
Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond March 31. Our 2012 EBITDA, revenue and driver guidance remain unchanged. 
Finally, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.85 per share based on a diluted share count of 148 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

And we are constantly out in the market looking to see if there are great transactions we can bring in to enhance essentially our Wyndham Grand through possible use of mezzanine financing or other financial support initiatives. We haven't done very many of them. We do them on a regular basis so we are providing some development advances but nothing that's so meaningful that we've called it out. A while ago, we said that we are setting aside like $200 million dollars for these type of mezzanine and development advances. Just to kind of throw a number out there, but we haven't come close to using anywhere near that over the last couple of years. And I don't know what it will come to look like in the future. We feel like we've got great momentum with the Wyndham Grand right now. We're seeing a lot more opportunities than this before to bring them in.

We know that our timeshare resorts are slightly more occupied in 2011 than they were in 2012, and that trend seems to be working in our favor.

We are not pushing timeshare harder though to kind of part of your point. It's not like we have the accelerator down on full on the timeshare sales. As we've said, we'd like to keep that to a mid-single-digit grower.  Now we've been bidding that continually because this is a horse that's running very fast and efficiently, and we're not going to stop it or slow it down but we're not feeling it anymore capital so the horse running at high speed without requiring any more capital. Were happy with that. And a part of it is because  of what you're talking about greater travel trends, more people traveling to Orlando, I mean, there's more people that we can meet at our marketing offsite offices to bring them into take tours. But we limit the number of tours, so I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming factor. So kind of a long answer to a short question, but there's a lot involved in that dynamic that you identified."

The booking windows have gone shorter and shorter in Europe like they've got in the U.S., basically driven by technology, so much information is available now, people wait later to make their bookings. And so we don't have the great visibility into the summer yet. But the shoulder season is good. It's up -- it's actually ahead of last year. U.K., definitely just give a little bit more color. U.K. definitely the most challenged of the markets over there.

It enabled our sales force to close more transactions.

First quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. Significantly, adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 36% and came in $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect strong operational performance in each of our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. We continue to successfully execute against our operating plans with strong performance across the company. Lodging and Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, excluding the intersegment license fee for the Wyndham brand name. 
In Lodging, RevPAR was up 7% with continued gains in both occupancy and rate. Vacation Ownership had an outstanding quarter, supported by a strong consumer travel in the U.S. and continuing progress in optimizing marketing efficiencies. 
And Exchange and Rental was highly effective in managing a difficult operating environment in Europe, as well as limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at $1.30 per share, a 26% increase from the first quarter of last year. As you know, our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in our businesses at attractive returns and then to return the cash to shareholders. We continued delivering cash to shareholders again in the first quarter, repurchasing 3.6 million shares of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 53% to $0.23 per share. 
In addition, this morning, we announced that our board has approved an additional $750 million to be added to our share repurchase authorization. Over the past few years, we have achieved shareholder returns in excess of the industry and market benchmarks due to: first, the strength of our largely fee-for-service business models; second, our proven ability to optimize all of our businesses through superior execution; third, our focus on growing free cash flow; and finally, our capital allocation that includes an increasing dividend and the repurchase our shares. 
We are very proud of what we've achieved, but we know that we have much to accomplish. As people in our office will tell you, my question usually is, what have you done for me lately? As management, it is our job to drive the growth of our business because a business without growth has diminishing value. 
So let me tell you why I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year and beyond. First, while we're cautious about Europe, we continue to see a global economic recovery in line with our expectations. We had 2 significant customer events earlier this month, our Global Hotel Convention and the American Resort Development Association or ARDA Conference. 
Our hotel convention, which is held every 18 months, brings together owners for all 15 of our widely known Lodging brands. More than 5,000 owners and managers, as well as 130 suppliers, were in attendance, and we were able to get a very hands-on read of the state of the global hotel industry. 
Since our last conference in September of 2010, there's been an obvious improvement in the mood and outlook of our franchisees and partners. Many of our suppliers saw increased order and lead activity, and almost without exception, the owners and managers I spoke with strongly felt that things were improving. 
And hotel owners are looking to invest in their hotels as well. So in addition to the numbers we are seeing, this is great confirmation that, for us, the Lodging recovery is firmly established. 
The mood was positive at the ARDA Conference as well but a bit measured, as the small to medium developers continue to have limited access to capital. Attendance at over 2,500 was strong, and we were encouraged by the number of new developers, both domestic and international. Interest in timeshare continues to grow around the world, which bodes well for RCI and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. 
As I mentioned earlier, the current economic environment in Europe is challenging our efforts to grow our Vacation Rental businesses. We expect our European Vacation Rental business to remain stable overall due to the strength and resiliency of our portfolio of established brands and customer bases, as well as our strong, experienced management teams. 
First quarter performance was consistent with these expectations, and our full-year outlook for Europe remains unchanged. 
Let me now spend a few moments giving you an update on the progress in our business units in the first quarter. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make progress in executing its Apollo initiatives, which is a series of technology projects focused on improving our value proposition to franchisees. 
Our franchisees will be able to measure our results by the number of direct room nights we deliver to overall bookings, primarily through our online strategy. Our goal is to capture the maximum amount of online traffic and then convert these online visitors to staying guests. Remember that the launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first step in our Apollo plan to drive more room nights through our online direct distribution channels. 
Preliminary results have exceeded our expectations with brand booking increases averaging over 10%. As we discussed in the last call, in 2011, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 50% of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own brand sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information and ultimately book with us. We saw an approximate 30% increase in bookings during the pilot period. 
This past quarter, we rolled out TripAdvisor to the majority of our websites and will be fully implemented by the end of May. In conjunction with the rollout, we launched Wynn Review, a suite of tools and services designed to help our franchisees manage their online ratings and reviews. We expect our affiliation with TripAdvisor, one of the first in the industry, to drive conversions, as well as support brand quality. 
We are also excited about our new mobile websites. By the end of next year, it is expected that more people will access the Internet using a mobile device than a computer. Research indicates that nearly 65% of mobile bookings are made on the day of arrival, many within 5 miles of the hotel. 
Based on the narrow booking window of our consumers, as well as the distribution of our hotels, we feel this represents a significant opportunity for us to capture the on-road connected traveler. We've designed our mobile sites with the end-user in mind, providing a robust interface along with geographic search capabilities. We've made great progress, and we believe we are among the leaders in the industry in these efforts. 
In addition to important initiatives like Apollo that drive our core business, we are pursuing a worldwide growth strategy that leverages our strong and diverse brand portfolio, as well as our global footprint. For example, last year, we had great success in leveraging relationships to pen multi-unit deals, and we expect an acceleration of those efforts this year. 
As we previously reported, to support the growth of our hotel system, we are planning to provide mezzanine financing and other financial support over the next several years. 
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. I want to take a moment to commend the Rentals team, which, despite the headwinds in Europe and a disappointing ski season in the U.S., grew revenues 3% and transactions 2% organically. The challenges in Europe were felt most significantly at the Hoseasons Group in the U.K., while Novasol, which is in Denmark, and Landal, in the Netherlands, continued to post solid results. 
While it's too early to get a clear read on the summer season, bookings in the shoulder seasons are ahead of last year, which is an encouraging sign. But as I said earlier, our outlook for European rentals remains cautious for the year. We continue to make significant strides in our Vacation Rentals integration, which is key to our strategy to build a strong North American platform and gain market share, as well as improve margins in this rapidly growing industry. 
In the second quarter, we expect to launch 2 significant initiatives: First, in North America, we will consolidate 23 rental websites into a single improved site; second in Europe, we will integrate the inventory and reservation platform of our U.K. cottages, parks and lodges brands into a common property management system, a change that will enable further yield management and operational efficiencies. 
RCI's commitment to providing the best tools in the industry to its members and affiliates was showcased at the ARDA convention. RCI was honored with 10 ARDA awards, including the coveted ACE Excellence in Customer Service Award. 
Coming on the heels of the major enhancements to rci.com over the past 18 months, including trading power transparency and new online search tools, RCI continues to innovate with the introduction of several new programs, including online tour generation, which will provide affiliates with a new source of qualified sales prospects using RCI's robust platform for lead regeneration and sophisticated screening tools, and the timeshare online listening center, which is a social media monitoring command center, providing our affiliates with a proactive service that protects and promotes their online brand reputations while improving customer service to our owners. The strength of RCI's technology continues to pay off with online transaction penetration growing to over 40%, up more than 400 basis points from last year.
Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which is always -- which is also a recognized industry innovator. Results were stellar at WVO with volume per guest increases of 10% and tour increases of 8%. We're seeing great results from our latest initiative to drive efficiencies, our credit prescreening program. As you know, timeshare is a sold rather than a sought product, and finding good prospects is key to our success. So last year, we introduced the proprietary creditworthiness prescreening program. The rollout of this program is now effectively complete, and it has increased our efficiency by identifying the most qualified prospects for our salespeople. 
We believe that the credit prescreening program was a meaningful contributor to the 10% lift in VPG and that this will be another game changer for us in the industry. Great innovation, focused management and terrific execution delivered truly outstanding results at WVO. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. Developer interest is strong, and we recently signed our first WAAM agreement for our WorldMark by Wyndham product. Located in the south mountain region of Arizona near Scottsdale, our 5th WAAM deal is a purpose-built timeshare project that will nicely complement our 3 existing Arizona locations within the WorldMark portfolio. We expect to start sales on this product in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"

First, I have a basic business philosophy that says success is never final. The results of this quarter are an outcome of the strategic initiatives in place at each business unit and the overall company initiatives that we continue to advance and refine over time. We had a terrific quarter, as Steve said, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% ahead of first quarter 2011 and $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range, due to the strong execution at each of our business units and the benefit of share repurchases. 
Well, as you know, we are focused on growing our free cash flow and deploying it effectively to enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow increased to $193 million or $1.30 per share for the first 3 months in 2012, compared with $185 million or $1.03 per share during the same period in 2011. 
For the year, we expect that our available cash flow, which includes proceeds from our debt offerings, will be approximately $1 billion. We repurchased 3.6 million shares of stock in the first quarter of 2012, spending $150 million. 
Year-to-date through yesterday's market close, we have purchased a total of 4.4 million shares for $190 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. And with the $750 million increase, as of market close yesterday, we have $940 million available in our share repurchase program. 
Our capital allocation policy has been consistent since our launch as a public company in August 2006. First, we'll use our cash to invest in our businesses up to the point that the return is compelling. Second, we'll pursue accretive fee-for-service acquisitions in our core businesses such Hotel and Vacation Rental. And then finally, we'll distribute cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Now before we get to our operating performance for the quarter, let's review our recent capital markets activity. We completed a number of transactions and pushed out terms on our unsecured debt financings at record low interest rates. We believe that these actions strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, while maintaining an overall investment-grade credit profile. 
So first, we completed a $650 million tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2014 and 2016. Our 2014 notes carried a coupon rate of 9 and 7/8, and we were able to bring down our notes coming due in 2016 from $800 million to $357 million. 
These notes were replaced with the issuance of $950 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 and 10 years, with a weighted-average coupon of 3.84%. We also reduced our revolver borrowings by approximately $170 million. The combined impact of these transactions increased our unsecured debt outstanding by over $125 million. Now that's consistent with our plan to maintain leverage as our EBITDA increases. 
We will use the extra funds for our strategic initiatives and share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation policy. The debt repurchase resulted in a pretax charge of $106 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2012 adjusted results. 
In addition, even with our $125 million increase in debt, our net interest expense will decrease by approximately $10 million in 2012 or $13 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to the ABS markets. Last month, we announced a $450 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 87.5% and a weighted average coupon of 3%, another record low. As expected, the advanced rate was lower than our 2011 transactions, as a direct result of our decision to opt for a lower overall coupon rate. 
Had we opted to issue a BB tranche, similar to our deals in 2011, our advance rate would have been higher, but so would our overall coupon rate. We believe we've hit the sweet spot of the current ABS markets, combining a record low coupon with a slightly lower but still very attractive advanced rate. 
Now moving to the operational performance for the quarter, let's begin the segment review with our Hotel group. Revenues were up 24% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase reflects RevPAR improvement, incremental revenue from the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando, and higher revenue from licensing fees charged to the company's Vacation Ownership business. The revenue also includes -- the revenue increase also includes a $10 million increase reporting clarification [ph], which had no impact on EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 23%, largely reflecting RevPAR increases, the recently opened Orlando Hotel and incremental intersegment licensing fees offset by higher marketing costs. 
Systemwide RevPAR increased 7% in the first quarter, but domestic RevPAR improved 9%, reflecting roughly equal gains domestically in both occupancy and average daily rate. 
International RevPAR was up 3%, led by favorable performance in our Asia-Pacific region, primarily China, while European RevPAR slowed somewhat. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,300 hotels worldwide, flat compared to the same period last year. 
The pipeline at March 31 sit at nearly 108,200 rooms, up 6% over the last year. For the first quarter, we added over 220 new deals to the pipeline, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's take a look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. The business unit demonstrated great resiliency in the face of difficult economic environment in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Segment revenues were $361 million in the first quarter compared to $356 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquisition-related revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues were flat. Exchange revenues decreased 3% in the quarter or 2% in constant currency compared with the same period of 2011. This reflects a 2% decline in our average number of members due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement, which would have resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. 
Exchange revenue per member was flat in the quarter compared with the same period in 2011. Vacation Rental revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues increased 3%. 
Organic transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2012 were up 2% compared with the first quarter of 2011, driven by the growth at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks business as well as our ResortQuest business in the U.S. This was partially offset by a decline in volume at our Hoseasons Group business in the U.K. due to weak economic conditions. 
Average net price per rental was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year. Overall, adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter compared with the same period of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, reflecting the economic challenges in Europe. 
Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared with the prior year, segment revenues increased 11%, reflecting increased VOI sales. Tours were up 8%, driven by improving efficiencies, and volume per guest was up a robust 10%, reflecting the positive impact from our credit prescreening program, improved close rates and enhanced product offerings, which drove an increase in the average amount purchased per owner. We expect VPG growth to moderate somewhat throughout the year as we lap the rollout of the credit prescreening program. 
Consistent with last year, we expect to add 27,000 new owners in 2012. In our WAAM business, commissions were up as we shifted the mix of sales to the new WAAM deals with higher commission rates. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 was $103 million, up 7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham brand trade name, adjusted EBITDA would have been double-digit at 11%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve although at a slower rate than we would like. Write-offs during the first quarter were $80 million, down from $85 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $96 million compared with $79 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales but also the limited improvement in portfolio performance. On a relative to sales basis, the provision was flat compared to last year. 
Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year. Now let me spend a few moments on guidance. Assuming no additional debt transactions, we expect our interest expense to decline for the full year from $135 million to $140 million, to $120 million to $125 million, reflecting our first quarter capital market transactions. 
As a result of this lower interest expense and first quarter share repurchases only, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.85 to $3, to $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 149 million shares, down from our original guidance of 153 million shares. 
Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond March 31. Our 2012 EBITDA, revenue and driver guidance remain unchanged. 
Finally, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.85 per share based on a diluted share count of 148 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

So I was hoping you can help us understand the drivers behind that. I know that the $28 million to $32 million, that's a net number, net of recoveries. So I guess my question is, what's driving that? Is that more recoveries? Or is it really that the cost of timeshare to be built? Is that coming down? Are things being built out more cheaply? Or is it a combination of 2?

We haven't done very many of them. We do them on a regular basis, so we are providing some development advances, but nothing that's so meaningful that we've called it out. A while ago, we said that we were setting aside like $200 million dollars for these type of mezzanine and development advances, just to kind of throw a number out there, but we haven't come close to using anywhere near that over the last couple of years. And I don't know what it will come to look like in the future. We feel like we've got great momentum with the Wyndham brand right now. We're seeing a lot more opportunities than we ever saw before to bring them in.

Steve, it's an insightful question, but I can't kind of tease apart the pieces because we've got a lot of things moving to try to drive efficiency in our sales process. We are not pushing timeshare harder though to kind of part of your point. It's not like we have the accelerator down on full on the timeshare sales. As we've said, we'd like to keep that to a mid-single-digit grower.  Now we've been beating that continually because this is a horse that's running very fast and efficiently, and we're not going to stop it or slow it down, but we're not feeding it any more capital. So the horse is running at a high speed without requiring any more capital. We’re happy with that. And a part of it is because of what you're talking about, greater travel trends. More people traveling to Orlando mean there's more people that we can meet at our marketing offsite offices to bring them in to take tours. But we limit the number of tours, so I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming factor. So kind of a long answer to a short question, but there's a lot involved in that dynamic that you identified."

The booking windows have gotten shorter and shorter in Europe like they've gotten in the U.S., basically driven by technology. Because so much information is available now, people wait later to make their bookings. And so we don't have the great visibility into the summer yet. But the shoulder season is good. It's up -- it's actually ahead of last year. U.K., definitely -- just to give a little bit more color. U.K. definitely the most challenged of the markets over there.

We did make some product enhancements to our VIP product level, which we believe impacted our ability to close on transactions. A more desirable VIP package, more people wanted it. It enabled our sales force to close more transactions.

First quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. Significantly, adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 36% and came in $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range. 
These results reflect strong operational performance in each of our businesses and the benefit of our share repurchase program. We continue to successfully execute against our operating plans with strong performance across the company. Lodging and Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, excluding the intersegment license fee for the Wyndham brand name. 
In Lodging, RevPAR was up 7% with continued gains in both occupancy and rate. Vacation Ownership had an outstanding quarter, supported by a strong consumer travel in the U.S. and continuing progress in optimizing marketing efficiencies. 
And Exchange and Rental was highly effective in managing a difficult operating environment in Europe, as well as limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Free cash flow was robust in the quarter at $1.30 per share, a 26% increase from the first quarter of last year. As you know, our capital allocation philosophy is to invest in our businesses at attractive returns and then to return the cash to shareholders. We continued delivering cash to shareholders again in the first quarter, repurchasing 3.6 million shares of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 53% to $0.23 per share. 
In addition, this morning, we announced that our board has approved an additional $750 million to be added to our share repurchase authorization. Over the past few years, we have achieved shareholder returns in excess of the industry and market benchmarks due to: first, the strength of our largely fee-for-service business models; second, our proven ability to optimize all of our businesses through superior execution; third, our focus on growing free cash flow; and finally, our capital allocation that includes an increasing dividend and the repurchase our shares. 
We are very proud of what we've achieved, but we know that we have much to accomplish. As people in our office will tell you, my question usually is, what have you done for me lately? As management, it is our job to drive the growth of our business because a business without growth has diminishing value. 
So let me tell you why I'm optimistic about our prospects for this year and beyond. First, while we're cautious about Europe, we continue to see a global economic recovery in line with our expectations. We had 2 significant customer events earlier this month, our Global Hotel Convention and the American Resort Development Association or ARDA Conference. 
Our hotel convention, which is held every 18 months, brings together owners for all 15 of our widely known Lodging brands. More than 5,000 owners and managers, as well as 130 suppliers, were in attendance, and we were able to get a very hands-on read of the state of the global hotel industry. 
Since our last conference in September of 2010, there's been an obvious improvement in the mood and outlook of our franchisees and partners. Many of our suppliers saw increased order and lead activity, and almost without exception, the owners and managers I spoke with strongly felt that things were improving. 
And hotel owners are looking to invest in their hotels as well. So in addition to the numbers we are seeing, this is great confirmation that, for us, the Lodging recovery is firmly established. 
The mood was positive at the ARDA Conference as well but a bit measured, as the small to medium developers continue to have limited access to capital. Attendance at over 2,500 was strong, and we were encouraged by the number of new developers, both domestic and international. Interest in timeshare continues to grow around the world, which bodes well for RCI and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. 
As I mentioned earlier, the current economic environment in Europe is challenging our efforts to grow our Vacation Rental businesses. We expect our European Vacation Rental business to remain stable overall due to the strength and resiliency of our portfolio of established brands and customer bases, as well as our strong, experienced management teams. 
First quarter performance was consistent with these expectations, and our full-year outlook for Europe remains unchanged. 
Let me now spend a few moments giving you an update on the progress in our business units in the first quarter. Wyndham Hotel Group continues to make progress in executing its Apollo initiatives, which is a series of technology projects focused on improving our value proposition to franchisees. 
Our franchisees will be able to measure our results by the number of direct room nights we deliver to overall bookings, primarily through our online strategy. Our goal is to capture the maximum amount of online traffic and then convert these online visitors to staying guests. Remember that the launch of our new hotel brand websites and improved content were the first step in our Apollo plan to drive more room nights through our online direct distribution channels. 
Preliminary results have exceeded our expectations with brand booking increases averaging over 10%. As we discussed in the last call, in 2011, we piloted TripAdvisor ratings and reviews on wyndhamrewards.com. Industry research indicates that up to 50% of consumers will not book a hotel without reading a review. Making ratings and reviews readily available on our own brand sites ensures consumers don't have to leave our site to get that information and ultimately book with us. We saw an approximate 30% increase in bookings during the pilot period. 
This past quarter, we rolled out TripAdvisor to the majority of our websites and will be fully implemented by the end of May. In conjunction with the rollout, we launched Wynn Review, a suite of tools and services designed to help our franchisees manage their online ratings and reviews. We expect our affiliation with TripAdvisor, one of the first in the industry, to drive conversions, as well as support brand quality. 
We are also excited about our new mobile websites. By the end of next year, it is expected that more people will access the Internet using a mobile device than a computer. Research indicates that nearly 65% of mobile bookings are made on the day of arrival, many within 5 miles of the hotel. 
Based on the narrow booking window of our consumers, as well as the distribution of our hotels, we feel this represents a significant opportunity for us to capture the on-road connected traveler. We've designed our mobile sites with the end-user in mind, providing a robust interface along with geographic search capabilities. We've made great progress, and we believe we are among the leaders in the industry in these efforts. 
In addition to important initiatives like Apollo that drive our core business, we are pursuing a worldwide growth strategy that leverages our strong and diverse brand portfolio, as well as our global footprint. For example, last year, we had great success in leveraging relationships to pen multi-unit deals, and we expect an acceleration of those efforts this year. 
As we previously reported, to support the growth of our hotel system, we are planning to provide mezzanine financing and other financial support over the next several years. 
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. I want to take a moment to commend the Rentals team, which, despite the headwinds in Europe and a disappointing ski season in the U.S., grew revenues 3% and transactions 2% organically. The challenges in Europe were felt most significantly at the Hoseasons Group in the U.K., while Novasol, which is in Denmark, and Landal, in the Netherlands, continued to post solid results. 
While it's too early to get a clear read on the summer season, bookings in the shoulder seasons are ahead of last year, which is an encouraging sign. But as I said earlier, our outlook for European rentals remains cautious for the year. We continue to make significant strides in our Vacation Rentals integration, which is key to our strategy to build a strong North American platform and gain market share, as well as improve margins in this rapidly growing industry. 
In the second quarter, we expect to launch 2 significant initiatives: First, in North America, we will consolidate 23 rental websites into a single improved site; second in Europe, we will integrate the inventory and reservation platform of our U.K. cottages, parks and lodges brands into a common property management system, a change that will enable further yield management and operational efficiencies. 
RCI's commitment to providing the best tools in the industry to its members and affiliates was showcased at the ARDA convention. RCI was honored with 10 ARDA awards, including the coveted ACE Excellence in Customer Service Award. 
Coming on the heels of the major enhancements to rci.com over the past 18 months, including trading power transparency and new online search tools, RCI continues to innovate with the introduction of several new programs, including online tour generation, which will provide affiliates with a new source of qualified sales prospects using RCI's robust platform for lead regeneration and sophisticated screening tools, and the timeshare online listening center, which is a social media monitoring command center, providing our affiliates with a proactive service that protects and promotes their online brand reputations while improving customer service to our owners. The strength of RCI's technology continues to pay off with online transaction penetration growing to over 40%, up more than 400 basis points from last year.
Now moving to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which is always -- which is also a recognized industry innovator. Results were stellar at WVO with volume per guest increases of 10% and tour increases of 8%. We're seeing great results from our latest initiative to drive efficiencies, our credit prescreening program. As you know, timeshare is a sold rather than a sought product, and finding good prospects is key to our success. So last year, we introduced the proprietary creditworthiness prescreening program. The rollout of this program is now effectively complete, and it has increased our efficiency by identifying the most qualified prospects for our salespeople. 
We believe that the credit prescreening program was a meaningful contributor to the 10% lift in VPG and that this will be another game changer for us in the industry. Great innovation, focused management and terrific execution delivered truly outstanding results at WVO. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM. Developer interest is strong, and we recently signed our first WAAM agreement for our WorldMark by Wyndham product. Located in the south mountain region of Arizona near Scottsdale, our 5th WAAM deal is a purpose-built timeshare project that will nicely complement our 3 existing Arizona locations within the WorldMark portfolio. We expect to start sales on this product in the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the financials. Tom?"

First, I have a basic business philosophy that says success is never final. The results of this quarter are an outcome of the strategic initiatives in place at each business unit and the overall company initiatives that we continue to advance and refine over time. We had a terrific quarter, as Steve said, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% ahead of first quarter 2011 and $0.04 above the top end of our guidance range, due to the strong execution at each of our business units and the benefit of share repurchases. 
Well, as you know, we are focused on growing our free cash flow and deploying it effectively to enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow increased to $193 million or $1.30 per share for the first 3 months in 2012, compared with $185 million or $1.03 per share during the same period in 2011. 
For the year, we expect that our available cash flow, which includes proceeds from our debt offerings, will be approximately $1 billion. We repurchased 3.6 million shares of stock in the first quarter of 2012, spending $150 million. 
Year-to-date through yesterday's market close, we have purchased a total of 4.4 million shares for $190 million. We continue to believe that share repurchase offers a compelling return. And with the $750 million increase, as of market close yesterday, we have $940 million available in our share repurchase program. 
Our capital allocation policy has been consistent since our launch as a public company in August 2006. First, we'll use our cash to invest in our businesses up to the point that the return is compelling. Second, we'll pursue accretive fee-for-service acquisitions in our core businesses such Hotel and Vacation Rental. And then finally, we'll distribute cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Now before we get to our operating performance for the quarter, let's review our recent capital markets activity. We completed a number of transactions and pushed out terms on our unsecured debt financings at record low interest rates. We believe that these actions strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position, while maintaining an overall investment-grade credit profile. 
So first, we completed a $650 million tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2014 and 2016. Our 2014 notes carried a coupon rate of 9 and 7/8, and we were able to bring down our notes coming due in 2016 from $800 million to $357 million. 
These notes were replaced with the issuance of $950 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 5 and 10 years, with a weighted-average coupon of 3.84%. We also reduced our revolver borrowings by approximately $170 million. The combined impact of these transactions increased our unsecured debt outstanding by over $125 million. Now that's consistent with our plan to maintain leverage as our EBITDA increases. 
We will use the extra funds for our strategic initiatives and share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation policy. The debt repurchase resulted in a pretax charge of $106 million, which has been excluded from our first quarter 2012 adjusted results. 
In addition, even with our $125 million increase in debt, our net interest expense will decrease by approximately $10 million in 2012 or $13 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to the ABS markets. Last month, we announced a $450 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 87.5% and a weighted average coupon of 3%, another record low. As expected, the advanced rate was lower than our 2011 transactions, as a direct result of our decision to opt for a lower overall coupon rate. 
Had we opted to issue a BB tranche, similar to our deals in 2011, our advance rate would have been higher, but so would our overall coupon rate. We believe we've hit the sweet spot of the current ABS markets, combining a record low coupon with a slightly lower but still very attractive advanced rate. 
Now moving to the operational performance for the quarter, let's begin the segment review with our Hotel group. Revenues were up 24% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase reflects RevPAR improvement, incremental revenue from the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando, and higher revenue from licensing fees charged to the company's Vacation Ownership business. The revenue also includes -- the revenue increase also includes a $10 million increase reporting clarification [ph], which had no impact on EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 23%, largely reflecting RevPAR increases, the recently opened Orlando Hotel and incremental intersegment licensing fees offset by higher marketing costs. 
Systemwide RevPAR increased 7% in the first quarter, but domestic RevPAR improved 9%, reflecting roughly equal gains domestically in both occupancy and average daily rate. 
International RevPAR was up 3%, led by favorable performance in our Asia-Pacific region, primarily China, while European RevPAR slowed somewhat. We ended the quarter with approximately 609,300 hotels worldwide, flat compared to the same period last year. 
The pipeline at March 31 sit at nearly 108,200 rooms, up 6% over the last year. For the first quarter, we added over 220 new deals to the pipeline, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. 
Now let's take a look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. The business unit demonstrated great resiliency in the face of difficult economic environment in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Segment revenues were $361 million in the first quarter compared to $356 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding acquisition-related revenues and the impact of foreign currency, revenues were flat. Exchange revenues decreased 3% in the quarter or 2% in constant currency compared with the same period of 2011. This reflects a 2% decline in our average number of members due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement, which would have resulted in a situation that was no longer compelling for us. 
Exchange revenue per member was flat in the quarter compared with the same period in 2011. Vacation Rental revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues increased 3%. 
Organic transaction volumes in the first quarter of 2012 were up 2% compared with the first quarter of 2011, driven by the growth at our Novasol and Landal GreenParks business as well as our ResortQuest business in the U.S. This was partially offset by a decline in volume at our Hoseasons Group business in the U.K. due to weak economic conditions. 
Average net price per rental was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year. Overall, adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter compared with the same period of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, reflecting the economic challenges in Europe. 
Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared with the prior year, segment revenues increased 11%, reflecting increased VOI sales. Tours were up 8%, driven by improving efficiencies, and volume per guest was up a robust 10%, reflecting the positive impact from our credit prescreening program, improved close rates and enhanced product offerings, which drove an increase in the average amount purchased per owner. We expect VPG growth to moderate somewhat throughout the year as we lap the rollout of the credit prescreening program. 
Consistent with last year, we expect to add 27,000 new owners in 2012. In our WAAM business, commissions were up as we shifted the mix of sales to the new WAAM deals with higher commission rates. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 was $103 million, up 7% compared with the first quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham brand trade name, adjusted EBITDA would have been double-digit at 11%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Delinquency and default rates in the portfolio continue to improve although at a slower rate than we would like. Write-offs during the first quarter were $80 million, down from $85 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $96 million compared with $79 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales but also the limited improvement in portfolio performance. On a relative to sales basis, the provision was flat compared to last year. 
Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year. Now let me spend a few moments on guidance. Assuming no additional debt transactions, we expect our interest expense to decline for the full year from $135 million to $140 million, to $120 million to $125 million, reflecting our first quarter capital market transactions. 
As a result of this lower interest expense and first quarter share repurchases only, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.85 to $3, to $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 149 million shares, down from our original guidance of 153 million shares. 
Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond March 31. Our 2012 EBITDA, revenue and driver guidance remain unchanged. 
Finally, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.82 to $0.85 per share based on a diluted share count of 148 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

So I was hoping you can help us understand the drivers behind that. I know that the $28 million to $32 million, that's a net number, net of recoveries. So I guess my question is, what's driving that? Is that more recoveries? Or is it really that the cost of timeshare to be built? Is that coming down? Are things being built out more cheaply? Or is it a combination of 2?

We haven't done very many of them. We do them on a regular basis, so we are providing some development advances, but nothing that's so meaningful that we've called it out. A while ago, we said that we were setting aside like $200 million dollars for these type of mezzanine and development advances, just to kind of throw a number out there, but we haven't come close to using anywhere near that over the last couple of years. And I don't know what it will come to look like in the future. We feel like we've got great momentum with the Wyndham brand right now. We're seeing a lot more opportunities than we ever saw before to bring them in.

We know that our timeshare resorts are slightly more occupied in 2011 than they were in 2012, and that trend seems to be working in our favor. More people in our timeshare resorts mean there are more people for us to talk to about adding more product to their portfolio so -- buying more of our points. So there is a benefit to it. Steve, it's an insightful question, but I can't kind of tease apart the pieces because we've got a lot of things moving to try to drive efficiency in our sales process. We are not pushing timeshare harder though to kind of part of your point. It's not like we have the accelerator down on full on the timeshare sales. As we've said, we'd like to keep that to a mid-single-digit grower.  Now we've been beating that continually because this is a horse that's running very fast and efficiently, and we're not going to stop it or slow it down, but we're not feeding it any more capital. So the horse is running at a high speed without requiring any more capital. We’re happy with that. And a part of it is because of what you're talking about, greater travel trends. More people traveling to Orlando mean there's more people that we can meet at our marketing offsite offices to bring them in to take tours. But we limit the number of tours, so I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming factor. So kind of a long answer to a short question, but there's a lot involved in that dynamic that you identified."

The booking windows have gotten shorter and shorter in Europe like they've gotten in the U.S., basically driven by technology. Because so much information is available now, people wait later to make their bookings. And so we don't have the great visibility into the summer yet. But the shoulder season is good. It's up -- it's actually ahead of last year. U.K., definitely -- just to give a little bit more color. U.K. definitely the most challenged of the markets over there.

I'm pleased to report that we had another great quarter as we continue to execute at a high level and an uncertain global economic environment. Second quarter revenues increased by over 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 10%. Adjusted EPS was up 36% and came in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range.
Wyndham Hotel group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth. I'm also pleased with the efforts of our Wyndham exchange and rental teams, which was in line with our expectations, producing stable results despite the economic challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. 
We continue to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. So far this year, we spend nearly $17 million on dividends and $400 million on share repurchases. Our second quarter weighted average diluted share count decreased by $23 million from the same period last year. 
Our inception as a private company on August 1, 2006 through yesterday, we repurchased 73.8 million shares at an average price of $32.60 per share. 
Equally important for long-term shareholder value is our ongoing commitment to invest in our business to drive earnings growth and increased cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million assumes CapEx of approximately $200 million, about half of which is used to fund growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business, rci.com and Vacation Rentals reservation and website integration in our exchange and rentals business and Voyager, a program to optimize our reservation system in our Vacation Ownership business. 
We also continue to selectively evaluate the potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they're strategically and economically compelling. 
Now moving to our business unit review.  The Wyndham Hotel group had another great quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and domestic RevPAR gains of nearly 8%. We made some significant development headway in the second quarter, many deal with Hospitality Properties Trust or HPT, a 20 Hotel portfolio comprising 3,000 rooms throughout the U.S. All of the properties will be rebranded as Wyndham hotels, with the remaining 16 properties be rebranded Hawthorn Suites. The conversions are scheduled to occur next week, providing growth for 2 of our brands and adding 20 properties for our managed portfolio. We are pleased to partner with HPT and hope to work more closely with them in the years to come. We look forward to updating you on similar deals going forward.
We are aggressively pursuing many tracks to grow the total number of hotel rooms in our system, including investing in our brand's market position, focusing on multi-deal contracts both for conversion and new construction and increasing retention of our existing franchisees. 
Essential to all of our strategies is improving our system contribution and the resulting value propositions to our franchisees. We will achieve this primarily through the Apollo initiatives, which we have spoken about before. We made significant progress over the past 2 years with one of our key Apollo initiatives, brand.com. Revenue and room nights across the brand portfolio are up approximately 20% from this channel year-to-date, in part due to improved content and web functionality. 
On the international front, over the next 5 years, we expect annual system size growth of 8% in EMEA, 15% in Latin America and our highest growth market will be APAC, where we expect our system size to almost double by 2016. This is from an exceptionally strong base in the region, particularly in China where we have close to 60,000 rooms. The long term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. We are also seeking to grow in India and other countries such as Singapore and Thailand on an opportunistic basis.
Of course, brand equity is the foundation for growth. We are specially pleased with our ranking this year in Consumer Reports Annual Travel issue. From Microtel and Wingate will rank #1 in their segments. In the budget segment, Microtel top the list for the third time and was joined in the top 5 by Super 8 and Days In. 
Now moving to Wyndham exchange and rental. In constant currency, rental revenues in Europe for the quarter were flat compared with the second quarter of last year. This was a significant accomplishment given the tough macroeconomic conditions. Year-to-date, European vacation rental revenues increased by 1%. As I said, before, we assembled a collection of the best vacation rental product in the right locations, which provide great value to a variety of consumer segments throughout the many different European markets in which we operate. 
We continue to be confident with the resiliency of this business because of several factors: The outstanding value proposition of our products, the strength of our brands and our management teams, the concentration of our fee-to-markets in northern European economies, our ability to retain homeowners and attract homes owners who are looking for rental income, in fact, many of our properties are drive to destinations and the operating flexibility of our mostly fee-for-service business model. 
In total, approximately 95% of our European vacation rental volume comes from our Landal GreenParks, Whole Seasons and Novasol brands. Each brand is a market leader and the majority of the consumers are driving to the product. Nearly 90% of Landal consumers are from the Netherlands and Germany, while Novasol generates 80% of its customers from Germany and Scandinavia. While British Whole Seasons cottage and parts business, over 95% of customers are from the U.K. 
Our Vacation Rentals are an outstanding value and represents an affordable family vacation option. To put this value proposition in perspective, in 2011, our European vacation rental business had an average daily rate of $140. This is for inventory that is predominantly single-family homes with multiple bedrooms, living space and full kitchens. This can vary compares to the same $140 average daily rate for a single hotel room in Europe.
In the technology side in Europe, we launched a new integrated reservation platform for our U.K. cottage in Parks brands, enabling greater efficiency in our internal process, as well as our ability to drive inventory utilization. 
Beyond Europe in the second quarter, our North American rental teams continue their strategic focus on innovation, with key accomplishments including the consolidation of 23 separate ResortQuest websites into a single enhanced platform under the Wyndham Vacation Rentals brand, Umbrella. 
For RCI, our business development teams have added over 75 resorts to our system through midyear. We announced several outstanding new affiliations, including the Bahama Residence Club, which will provide RCI members with access to more than 300 luxury Caribbean units, managed by such world-class brands as Rosewood and Mondreon.
In the technology front, we completed another successful release of rci.com, which included an upgrade to an innovative click-to-chat functionality with multiple language support. From when we started the project in the first quarter of 2008 to the end of 2012, we expect our migration to online transactions to improve our exchange and rentals margin by over 225 basis points. Enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members with greater functionality and better online content. The result is that online transactions in the second quarter were 41% of total transactions compared with 13% when we began the project 4 years ago. 
Finally, let's turn to Vacation Ownership. WVO continue to achieve stellar results, with revenue increasing 5% and EBITDA increasing 15%. Courville and volume per guest remains strong, aided by our credit prescreening tool. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our focus on free cash flow. A first step was establishing the Wyndham vacation -- to the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM, which positions us to offer turnkey solutions for developers or banks holding inventory, which we sell for a fee through our industry-leading sales and marketing channels. 
In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced WAAM 2.0, where we not only sell third-party inventory, but also offer consumer loans. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capitalized operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal late last year and began sales in the second quarter of 2012. Tom will walk you through the accounting on this later. 
Finally, regarding our corporate matter. As you may know, we are in litigation with the FTC regarding Wyndham hotel's data security and privacy practices in relation to data breaches that occurred from 2008 to 2010, which eliminated the amount of consumer information that some Wyndham hotels and resorts branded properties may have been accessed. 
Let me first say that we've cooperate fully with the FTC in its investigation of these data breaches and that safeguarding consumer information is a priority for us. We believe the FTC's claims are without merit, and we will vigorously defend our position. Regardless, we did not believe that the outcome of the litigation will have a material effect on our company. 
Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a special anniversary. Next week, we will celebrate the 6 anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I'd like to take a moment to evaluate our performance for shareholders over those years. 
Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $2.7 billion to our shareholders through the end of the second quarter. A cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 29% reduction in our share count. And our total return to shareholders, including dividends, has been 81% compared with 21% for the S&P 500. With never being satisfied we still have good opportunities to build on this accomplishments. Tom?"
31063165,209942307,330048,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Let me start with a brief comments on the overall quarterly results and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance. As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue t",1717,"Thank you, Steve. Let me start with a brief comments on the overall quarterly results and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance. 
As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, stronger operational execution at each of our business units and disciplined capital allocation. Overall, our second quarter results again were strong, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% about the same period in 2011 for the second quarter in a row, and $0.02 above the top of top-end of our guidance range. These results reflect the solid performance in our Lodging and Vacation Ownership businesses and a meaningful impact from our ongoing share repurchase program. 
We continue to generate high levels of free cash flow and consistent with our capital allocation strategy, return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while actively seeking value-enhancing acquisitions in our core businesses. 
In the first 6 months of 2012, free cash flow increased to $567 million or $3.83 per share, compared with $544 million or $3.13 per share during the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of $51 million of VAT refund received last year.
We expect that our available cash for the year, which includes net proceeds from AVS financings and assumes will calibrate leverage to our increased EBITDA, will be approximately $1 billion. 
With our strong free cash flow, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock in the second quarter of 2012 for a total of $190 million. Taking into account the additional 1.1 million shares purchased thus far during quarter 3, we have $733 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's start with Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 23% and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% compared with the second quarter of 2011, reflecting an increase in franchise royalties and higher interest segment fees for the use of the Wyndham brand. Excluding the inner segment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. Revenue increase also included $10 million of reporting reclassifications and $11 million of incremental global franchise conference fees, both of which were fully offset by expenses.
And that RevPAR improved by 8% in the second quarter, while system-wide RevPAR increased 5%. North American RevPAR improvement was driven primarily by an increase in the average daily rate. Positive trend and pricing power in our segments. This bodes well for continued Lodging recovery. International RevPAR was up 2% in constant currency. 
The system size was essentially unchanged, with gross openings of 13,500 and terminations of 16,400. Openings were in line with expectations, while terminations were higher than expected as a result of some proactive steps on our part to adjust underperforming franchisees. Note that we expect 3,022 rooms from the HPT transaction that Steve mentioned earlier enter the system on August 1. Net overall pipeline activity is up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. 
Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Again, this quarter, our exchange and rentals business demonstrated solid performance in the face of a difficult European macroeconomic environment and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. As Steve articulated, we have great confidence in both our exchange and rentals businesses based on the quality of the management teams but, product offerings and our mostly fee-for-service model. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, revenues for the quarter were flat compared to the same period 2011. Excluding acquisitions in foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, flat if you exclude a $4 million claim settlement related to the gulf oil spill. 
The constant currency second quarter vacation exchange revenues were flat. Exchange revenue per member increased by 2% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher exchange fees. Average number of members declined 2% in the quarter due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012. 
Vacation rental revenues were down $10 million for the quarter, unfavorably impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. If you are to exclude the impact from acquisition and the net effect of foreign currency, vacation rental revenues were flat. Transaction volumes were down 3% due to weak economic conditions in Europe, offset by a 4% increase in the average net price per rental, primarily driven by a higher yield that our whole seasons in the U.K. and Landal GreenParks business in Holland. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. The business again delivered another outstanding quarter. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased by $29 million or 5%, primarily due to the positive impacts of higher VPG and increased tour flow. Year-over-year gross VOI sales increased by $48 million or 12%. Year-to-date, we have brought 13,500 new owners into the system, an increase of 10% over the same period in 2011 and consistent with our annual goal of 27,000 new owners.
WAAM 1.0 volume was $18 million for the quarter. In addition, as Steve mentioned earlier, we began selling WAAM 2.0 products in June, with volume of $12 million by quarter end. As a reminder, the accounting for WAAM 2.0 transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet in a just-in-time basis. So we'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Note that at the end of the second quarter, approximately $60 million of inventory on the balance sheet was related to WAAM 2.0. 
WAAM 2.0 enables us to capture attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. Combined WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0  revenues showed a 58% increase over the same period of 2011. Consistent with our commitment to provide timely disclosures, we have added to break out of WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0 to Tables 3 and Table 9 of our press release.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $150 million, up 15% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if you were to exclude the higher interest segment licensing fees paid for the use of the Wyndham brand name, adjusted EBITDA increases 19%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year, right of a string the second quarter were $77 million, slightly up from the $75 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $100 million compared with $80 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and limited improvement in portfolio performance. Now while the portfolio remains strong overall, we had hoped to see more improvement in performance by now. 
If you look closely at the limited improvement in portfolio performance over the past few months and attributable primarily to the face and strength of the economic recovery. While there's nothing that we can do about the economy, we have to dramatically improved our buyer profile. In addition, we believe there are 2 other factors at play here. First, recent portfolio performance has been affected by an organized third-party scam or fraudulent representatives who are calling our customers and encouraging them to default their loans. We will work with authorities in these parties have been indicted. We believe this issue is now under control. Second, we are seeing an impact from some owners holding balances higher than historical norms. Typically loan performance diminishes as loan balances increase, and these loans are affecting overall portfolio performance. We are putting plans in place to mitigate the effect of these very manageable issues, and we'll keep you updated as we progress.
ABS capital markets remain robust. On July 19, we close the $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 90% in a weighted average coupon of 2.66%, another great execution. We couldn't be happier with the results. Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations. 
Having completed our 5-year plan review process, we are solidly on course with our long term goals. We are committed to EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, with high single to low double-digit growth in the Hotel group and mid-single-digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We remain committed to an investment grade profile, which will enable us to increase debt by $300 million for everyone $100 million that we add in EBITDA. The result is $1 billion of available cash to deploy each year to increase shareholder value. 
2 years ago, we shared at the deployment of that cash through M&A and share repurchase with the result in compound annual EPS growth of between 17% and 21% over the subsequent 5 year period. We were well on our way to achieving and exceeding that goal. 
And finally, I would like to spend a few moments on guidance. Full year revenue guidance is unchanged. We are, however, raising of the low end of EBITDA guidance with the new range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. 
In the business units, we expect ownership and launching revenues and adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of their respective ranges. We expect Exchange and Rentals revenues to be at the low end of its range, and adjusted EBITDA to be at the midpoint of its range. 
Also, we expect corporate expenses to be at the high end of the numeric range, while the depreciation, amortization will be at the low end of the numeric range. 
Business unit driver guidance remains unchanged. We are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.10 to $3.20. Our prior guidance was $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 147 million shares. Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond June 30, while some analyst estimates factor-in estimated repurchases in the second half of the year. 
In the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $1.7 to $1.10. This is below the consensus, reflecting differences in both share repurchases assumptions and seasonality between the third and fourth quarters. However, our guidance for the second half of the year is consistent with these expectations. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve"

I know that you mentioned to me that that business actually has held up very well. I was wondering again sort of through quarter whether there was any change there and especially of the European side. And, I guess, I would note that it does look like the average price per vacation rental and vacation rental transactions did look like it declined a little bit. And then separately maybe for Tom on the securitization market, it seems been strong. Is that helping, I'm sure other timeshare development accelerate their sales, which could then boost the old RCA membership business?"

Again, looking within the quarter, we think was your first question, did we see any trending? Within markets, we do see trending every month and every week. And that's because of weather. I mean the weather has been miserable. For those who watch the British Open recently, the announcer just kept talking about how miserable the weather has been over there. And that -- we never complained about the weather, but that doesn't have any impacts. So when you see trending, the economy has something to do with it, but the weather does as well because these people are driving to these locations. So do we see any trending? Steve, I wouldn't say there was any trending that I would say was meaningful. We saw pockets that were stronger as the period went on. We saw pockets that are a little bit weaker. But nothing that I would say was given us any reason to pause frankly. And with respect to the pricing over there, I think if you take out the FX impact and you actually see that the average place increased about 4%. So that business definitely is being impacted by a foreign currency translation. We feel really good about how those brands performed over there. The management did a terrific job. We didn't panic and try to drop price at all. They held price in the transaction volume picked up and we ended up the quarter very strong. And I will make one comment Steve, I don't know if was on your question or not, but you did ask me in the last quarter, looking into the -- because we have pretty good booking visibility into the summer for the rental business, and we feel it's pretty consistent with what we've seen so far that we're not going to see a huge uptick that were not seeing any decline that we think is meaningful. I think we'll be stable in that business just as we've been calling for all year long."

We do have national attrition which are properties that are just leaving the system for whatever reason. They're being taken out hotel stock in the marketplace or they're going through a significant repositioning of themselves. But there's also a significant amount of what we consider to be attrition that is kind of self-inflicted. We're knocking properties out because their qualities not keeping up or they're not paying, and that has always been the case. There's been a higher level of self-inflicted attrition, where we're making the decision to kick people out over the last several years, frankly not just the last couple of quarters, last several years as the economy has been so difficult for the hotel owners and they have not been investing in our properties. Now we're hopeful that we will see a turn on that. As we reported last quarter, I think the quarter before, we started to see some improvement in the receivables from our hotel franchisees. So we're optimistic that there will be an improvement of that. The good news is the ads have been very healthy. We've been adding a lot of properties. The problem is we've been taking out a lot, and that's been leaving us relatively flat. We feel that based on our pipeline and what we see as visibility for the second half of the year, they will be able to get to that growth range that we have designated."

I'm pleased to report we had another great quarter as we continue to execute at a high level in an uncertain global economic environment. Second quarter revenues increased by over 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 10%. Adjusted EPS was up 36% and came in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range.
Wyndham Hotel Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth. I'm also pleased with the efforts of our Wyndham Exchange and Rental teams, which was in line with our expectations, producing stable results despite the economic challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. 
We continue to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. So far this year, we've spent nearly $70 million [ph] on dividends and $400 million on share repurchases. Our second quarter weighted average diluted share count decreased by $23 million from the same period last year. From our inception as a private company on August 1, 2006 through yesterday, we repurchased 73.8 million shares at an average price of $32.60 per share. 
Equally important for long-term shareholder value is our ongoing commitment to invest in our business to drive earnings growth and increased cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million assumes CapEx of approximately $200 million, about half of which is used to fund growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business; rci.com and Vacation Rentals reservation and website integration in our Exchange and Rental business; and Voyager, a program to optimize our reservation system in our Vacation Ownership business. We also continued to selectively evaluate the potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they're strategically and economically compelling. 
Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had another great quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and domestic RevPAR gains of nearly 8%. We made some significant development headway in the second quarter, many a [ph] deal with Hospitality Properties Trust or HPT, a 20-hotel portfolio comprising 3,000 rooms throughout the U.S. All of the properties will be rebranded as Wyndham Hotels, with the remaining 16 properties to be rebranded Hawthorn Suites. The conversions are scheduled to occur next week, providing growth for 2 of our brands and adding 20 properties to our managed portfolio. We are pleased to partner with HPT and hope to work more closely with them in the years to come. We look forward to updating you on similar deals going forward.
We are aggressively pursuing many tracks to grow the total number of hotel rooms in our system, including investing in our brand's market position, focusing on multi-deal contracts, both for conversion and new construction, and increasing retention of our existing franchisees. Essential to all of our strategies is improving our system contribution and the resulting value proposition to our franchisees. We will achieve this primarily through the Apollo initiatives, which we have spoken about before. We've made significant progress over the past 2 years with one of our key Apollo initiatives, brand.com. Revenue and room nights across the brand portfolio are up approximately 20% from this channel year-to-date, in part due to improved content and web functionality. 
On the international front, over the next 4 years, we -- excuse me, over the next 5 years, we expect annual system size growth of 8% in EMEA, 15% in Latin America, and our highest growth market will be APAC, where we expect our system size to almost double by 2016. This is from an exceptionally strong base in the region, particularly in China where we have close to 60,000 rooms. The long term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. We are also seeking to grow in India and other countries such as Singapore and Thailand on an opportunistic basis.
Of course, brand equity is the foundation for growth. We are especially pleased with our rankings this year in Consumer Reports' annual travel issue. From Microtel and Wingate, we're ranked #1 in their segments. In the budget segment, Microtel topped the list for the third time and was joined in the top 5 by Super 8 and Days Inn. 
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rental. In constant currency, rental revenues in Europe for the quarter were flat compared with the second quarter of last year. This was a significant accomplishment given the tough macroeconomic conditions. Year-to-date, European Vacation Rental revenues increased by 1%. As I said before, we've assembled a collection of the best vacation rental product in the right locations, which provide great value to a variety of consumer segments throughout the many different European markets in which we operate. 
We continue to be confident with the resiliency of this business because of several factors: the outstanding value proposition of our products; the strength of our brands and our management teams; the concentration of our feeder markets in northern European economies; our ability to retain homeowners and attract homes -- homeowners who are looking to -- for rental income, in fact, many of our properties are drive-to destinations; and the operating flexibility of our mostly fee-for-service business model. 
In total, approximately 95% of our European Vacation Rental volume comes from our Landal GreenParks, Hoseasons and Novasol brands. Each brand is a market leader, and the majority of the consumers are driving to the product. Nearly 90% of Landal consumers are from the Netherlands and Germany, while Novasol generates 80% of its customers from Germany and Scandinavia. In our British Hoseason cottage and parks business, over 95% of customers are from the U.K. 
Our Vacation Rentals are an outstanding value and represent an affordable family vacation option. To put this value proposition in perspective, in 2011, our European Vacation Rental business had an average daily rate of $140. This is for the inventory that is predominantly single-family homes with multiple bedrooms, living space and full kitchens. This compares to the same $140 average daily rate for a single hotel room in Europe.
In the technology side in Europe, we launched a new integrated reservation platform for our U.K. cottage and parks brands, enabling greater efficiency in our internal process, as well as our ability to drive inventory utilization. 
Beyond Europe, in the second quarter, our North America Rental teams continued their strategic focus on innovation, with key accomplishments including the consolidation of 23 separate ResortQuest websites into a single enhanced platform under the Wyndham Vacation Rentals brand umbrella. 
In RCI, our business development teams have added over 75 resorts to our system through midyear. We announced several outstanding new affiliations, including the Baha Mar Residence Club, which will provide RCI members with access to more than 300 luxury Caribbean units, managed by such world-class brands as Rosewood and Mondrian.
In the technology front, we completed another successful release of rci.com, which included an upgrade to an innovative click-to-chat functionality with multiple language support. From when we started the project in the first quarter of 2008 to the end of 2012, we expect our migration to online transactions to improve our Exchange and Rentals margin by over 225 basis points. Enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members with greater functionality and better online content. The result is that online transactions in the second quarter were 41% of total transactions compared with 13% when we began the project 4 years ago. 
Finally, let's turn to Vacation Ownership. WVO continued to achieve stellar results, with revenue increasing 5% and EBITDA increasing 15%. Tour flow and volume per guest remained strong, aided by our credit prescreening tool. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our focus on free cash flow. Our first step was establishing the Wyndham vacation -- the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM, which positions us to offer turnkey solutions for developers' or banks' holding inventory, which we sell for a fee through our industry-leading sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced WAAM 2.0, where we not only sell third-party inventory, but also offer consumer loans. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capital aid operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal late last year and began sales in the second quarter of 2012. Tom will walk you through the accounting on this later. 
Finally, regarding a corporate matter. As you may know, we are in litigation with the FTC regarding Wyndham Hotel's data security and privacy practices in relation to data breaches that occurred from 2008 to 2010, in which a limited amount of consumer information at some Wyndham Hotels and Resort branded properties may have been accessed. Let me first say that we've cooperated fully with the FTC in its investigation of these data breaches and that safeguarding consumer information is a priority for us. We believe the FTC's claims are without merit, and we will vigorously defend our position. Regardless, we do not believe that the outcome of the litigation will have a material effect on our company. 
But before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a special anniversary. Next week, we will celebrate the 6th year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I'd like to take a moment to evaluate our performance for shareholders over those years. 
Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $2.7 billion to our shareholders through the end of the second quarter. A cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 29% reduction in our share count. And our total return to shareholders including dividends has been 81% compared with 21% for the S&P 500. We're never being satisfied. We know we still have great opportunities to build on these accomplishments. Tom?"

Let me start with brief comments on the overall quarterly results, and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance. As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue to",1719,"Thank you, Steve. Let me start with brief comments on the overall quarterly results, and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance. 
As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, stronger operational execution at each of our business units and disciplined capital allocation. Overall, our second quarter results, again, were strong, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% above the same period in 2011 for the second quarter in a row and $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect solid performance in our Lodging and Vacation Ownership businesses and a meaningful impact from our ongoing share repurchase program. 
We continue to generate high levels of free cash flow and, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while actively seeking value-enhancing acquisitions in our core businesses. In the first 6 months of 2012, free cash flow increased to $567 million or $3.83 per share, compared with $544 million or $3.13 per share during the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of $51 million of VAT refund received last year. We expect that our available cash for the year, which includes net proceeds from ABS financings and assumes we'll calibrate leverage to our increased EBITDA, will be approximately $1 billion. [ph] 
With our strong free cash flow, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock in the second quarter of 2012 for a total of $190 million. Taking into account the additional 1.1 million shares purchased thus far during quarter 3, we have $733 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's start with Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 23% and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% compared with the second quarter of 2011, reflecting an increase in franchise royalties and higher intersegment fees for the use of the Wyndham brand. Excluding the intersegment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. The revenue increase also included $10 million of reporting reclassifications and $11 million of incremental global franchise conference fees, both of which were fully offset by expenses.
Domestic RevPAR improved by 8% in the second quarter, while systemwide RevPAR increased 5%. North American RevPAR improvement was driven primarily by an increase in the average daily rate, further evidence of a positive trend in pricing power in our segments. This bodes well for continued Lodging recovery. Internationally, RevPAR was up 2% in constant currency. 
The system size was essentially unchanged, with gross openings of 15,500 and terminations of 16,400. Openings were in line with expectations, while terminations were higher than expected as a result of some proactive steps on our part to adjust underperforming franchisees. Note that we expect 3,022 rooms from the HPT transaction that Steve mentioned earlier to enter the system on August 1. Net overall pipeline activity is up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. 
Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Again, this quarter, our Exchange and Rentals business demonstrated solid performance in the face of a difficult European macroeconomic environment and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. As Steve articulated, we have great confidence in both our Exchange and Rental businesses based on the quality of the management teams, product offerings and our mostly fee-for-service business models. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, revenues for the quarter were flat compared to the same period 2011. Excluding acquisitions in foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, but flat if you exclude a $4 million claim settlement related to the Gulf oil spill. 
The constant currency second quarter Vacation Exchange revenues were flat. Exchange revenue per member increased by 2% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher Exchange fees. Average number of members declined 2% in the quarter due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012. 
Vacation Rental revenues were down $10 million for the quarter, unfavorably impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. If you are to exclude the impact from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues were flat. Transaction volumes were down 3% due to weak economic conditions in Europe, offset by a 4% increase in the average net price per rental, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Hoseasons Group in the U.K. and Landal GreenParks business in Holland. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. The business again delivered another outstanding quarter. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased by $29 million or 5%, primarily due to the positive impacts of higher VPG and increased tour flow. Year-over-year gross VOI sales increased by $48 million or 12%. Year-to-date, we have brought 13,500 new owners into the system, an increase of 10% over the same period in 2011 and consistent with our annual goal of 27,000 new owners.
WAAM 1.0 volume was $18 million for the quarter. In addition, as Steve mentioned earlier, we began selling WAAM 2.0 products in June, with volume of $12 million by quarter end. As a reminder, the accounting for WAAM 2.0 transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet in a just-in-time basis. So we'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Note that at the end of the second quarter, approximately $60 million of inventory on the balance sheet was related to WAAM 2.0. 
WAAM 2.0 enables us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. Combined WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0  revenues showed a 58% increase over the same period of 2011. Consistent with our commitment to provide timely disclosures, we have added the break out of WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0 to Tables 3 and Table 9 of our press release.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $150 million, up 15% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham brand name, adjusted EBITDA actually increases 19%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Writeoffs during the second quarter were $77 million, slightly up from the $75 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $100 million compared with $80 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and limited improvement in portfolio performance. 
Now while the portfolio remains strong overall, we had hoped to see more improvement in performance by now. If we looked closely at the limited improvement in portfolio performance over the past few months and attribute it primarily to the pace and strength of the economic recovery. But while there's nothing that we can do about the economy, we have dramatically improved our buyer profile. In addition, we believe there are 2 other factors at play here: first, recent portfolio performance has been affected by an organized third-party scam or fraudulent representatives who are calling our customers and encouraging them to default on their loans. We have worked with authorities, and these parties have been indicted. We believe this issue is now under control. Second, we are seeing an impact from some owners holding balances higher than historic norms. Typically, loan performance diminishes as loan balances increase. And these loans are affecting overall portfolio performance. We are putting plans in place to mitigate the effect of these very manageable issues, and we'll keep you updated as we progress.
ABS capital markets remain robust. On July 19, we closed a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 90% and a weighted average coupon of 2.66%, another great execution. We couldn't be happier with the results. 
Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations. 
Having completed our 5-year plan review process, we are solidly on course with our long term goals. We are committed to EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, with high single to low double-digit growth in the Hotel Group and mid-single-digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We remain committed to an investment grade profile, which will enable us to increase debt by $300 million for every $100 million that we add in EBITDA. The result is $1 billion of available cash to deploy each year to increase shareholder value. 2 years ago, we shared that the deployment of that cash through M&A and share repurchase would result in compound annual EPS growth of between 17% and 21% over the subsequent 5-year period. Well, we're well on our way to achieving and exceeding that goal. 
Now finally, I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. Full year revenue guidance is unchanged. We are, however, raising the lower end of EBITDA guidance with a new range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. In the business units, we expect Vacation Ownership and Lodging revenues and adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of their respective ranges. We expect Exchange and Rentals revenues to be at the low end of its range and adjusted EBITDA to be at the midpoint of its range. Also, we expect corporate expense to be at the high end of the numeric range, while depreciation and amortization will be at the low end of the numeric range. 
Business unit driver guidance remains unchanged. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.10 to $3.20. Our prior guidance was $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on the expected diluted share count of 147 million shares. Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond June 30, while some analysts' estimates factor in estimated repurchases in the second half of the year. 
In the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $1.07 to $1.10. This is below the consensus, reflecting differences in both share repurchase assumptions and seasonality between the third and fourth quarters. However, our guidance for the second half of the year is consistent with these expectations. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Well, I'll let Tom address the ABS part of the question. I'll start to tackle the European Rental question. Again, looking within the quarter, because think it was your first question, did we see any trending? Within markets, we do see trending every month and every week, and that's because of weather. I mean, the weather has been miserable. For those who watched the British Open recently, the announcers just kept talking about how miserable the weather has been over there. And that -- we never complained about the weather, but that does have an impact. So when you see trending, the economy has something to do with it, but the weather does as well because people are driving to these locations. So do we see any trending? Steve, I wouldn't say there was any trending that I would say was meaningful. We saw pockets that were stronger as the period went on. We saw pockets that were a little bit weaker. But nothing that I would say was giving us any reason to pause, frankly. And with respect to the pricing over there, I think if you take out the FX impact, you'll actually see that the average price increased about 4%. So that business definitely is being impacted by foreign currency translation. We feel really good about how those brands performed over there. The management did a terrific job. We didn't panic and try to drop price at all. They held price, and the transaction volume picked up and we ended up the quarter very strong. And I will make one comment, Steve, because I don't know if was on your question or not, but you did ask me the last quarter, looking into the -- because we have pretty good booking visibility into this summer for the Rental business, and we feel it's pretty consistent with what we've seen so far that we're not going to see a huge uptick, but we're not seeing any decline that we think is meaningful.

I'm pleased to report we had another great quarter as we continue to execute at a high level in an uncertain global economic environment. Second quarter revenues increased by over 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up ov",1660,"Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we had another great quarter as we continue to execute at a high level in an uncertain global economic environment. Second quarter revenues increased by over 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 10%. Adjusted EPS was up 36% and came in $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range.
Wyndham Hotel Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership each delivered double-digit EBITDA growth. I'm also pleased with the efforts of our Wyndham Exchange and Rental teams, which was in line with our expectations, producing stable results despite the economic challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. 
We continue to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. So far this year, we've spent nearly $70 million [ph] on dividends and $400 million on share repurchases. Our second quarter weighted average diluted share count decreased by $23 million from the same period last year. From our inception as a public company on August 1, 2006 through yesterday, we repurchased 73.8 million shares at an average price of $32.60 per share. 
Equally important for long-term shareholder value is our ongoing commitment to invest in our business to drive earnings growth and increased cash flow in the years to come. Our baseline sustainable free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $700 million assumes CapEx of approximately $200 million, about half of which is used to fund growth projects such as Apollo and our hotel business; rci.com and Vacation Rentals reservation and website integration in our Exchange and Rental business; and Voyager, a program to optimize our reservation system in our Vacation Ownership business. We also continued to selectively evaluate the potential acquisitions, which we will only pursue if they're strategically and economically compelling. 
Now moving to our business unit review. The Wyndham Hotel Group had another great quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% and domestic RevPAR gains of nearly 8%. We made some significant development headway in the second quarter, planning a deal with Hospitality Properties Trust or HPT, a 20-hotel portfolio comprising 3,000 rooms throughout the U.S. All of the properties will be rebranded as Wyndham Hotels, with the remaining 16 properties to be rebranded Hawthorn Suites. The conversions are scheduled to occur next week, providing growth for 2 of our brands and adding 20 properties to our managed portfolio. We are pleased to partner with HPT and hope to work more closely with them in the years to come. We look forward to updating you on similar deals going forward.
We are aggressively pursuing many tracks to grow the total number of hotel rooms in our system, including investing in our brand's market position, focusing on multi-deal contracts, both for conversion and new construction, and increasing retention of our existing franchisees. Essential to all of our strategies is improving our system contribution and the resulting value proposition to our franchisees. We will achieve this primarily through the Apollo initiatives, which we have spoken about before. We've made significant progress over the past 2 years with one of our key Apollo initiatives, brand.com. Revenue and room nights across the brand portfolio are up approximately 20% from this channel year-to-date, in part due to improved content and web functionality. 
On the international front, over the next 4 years, we -- excuse me, over the next 5 years, we expect annual system size growth of 8% in EMEA, 15% in Latin America, and our highest growth market will be APAC, where we expect our system size to almost double by 2016. This is from an exceptionally strong base in the region, particularly in China where we have close to 60,000 rooms. The long term vision is to have a footprint in China that rivals our presence in the U.S. We are also seeking to grow in India and other countries such as Singapore and Thailand on an opportunistic basis.
Of course, brand equity is the foundation for growth. We are especially pleased with our rankings this year in Consumer Reports' annual travel issue. From Microtel and Wingate, we're ranked #1 in their segments. In the budget segment, Microtel topped the list for the third time and was joined in the top 5 by Super 8 and Days Inn. 
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rental. In constant currency, rental revenues in Europe for the quarter were flat compared with the second quarter of last year. This was a significant accomplishment given the tough macroeconomic conditions. Year-to-date, European Vacation Rental revenues increased by 1%. As I said before, we've assembled a collection of the best vacation rental product in the right locations, which provide great value to a variety of consumer segments throughout the many different European markets in which we operate. 
We continue to be confident with the resiliency of this business because of several factors: the outstanding value proposition of our products; the strength of our brands and our management teams; the concentration of our feeder markets in northern European economies; our ability to retain homeowners and attract homes -- for homeowners who are looking to -- for rental income, in fact, many of our properties are drive-to destinations; and the operating flexibility of our mostly fee-for-service business model. 
In total, approximately 95% of our European Vacation Rental volume comes from our Landal GreenParks, Hoseasons and Novasol brands. Each brand is a market leader, and the majority of the consumers are driving to the product. Nearly 90% of Landal consumers are from the Netherlands and Germany, while Novasol generates 80% of its customers from Germany and Scandinavia. In our British Hoseason cottage and parks business, over 95% of customers are from the U.K. 
Our Vacation Rentals are an outstanding value and represent an affordable family vacation option. To put this value proposition in perspective, in 2011, our European Vacation Rental business had an average daily rate of $140. This is for the inventory that is predominantly single-family homes with multiple bedrooms, living space and full kitchens. This compares to the same $140 average daily rate for a single hotel room in Europe.
In the technology side in Europe, we launched a new integrated reservation platform for our U.K. cottage and parks brands, enabling greater efficiency in our internal process, as well as our ability to drive inventory utilization. 
Beyond Europe, in the second quarter, our North America Rental teams continued their strategic focus on innovation, with key accomplishments including the consolidation of 23 separate ResortQuest websites into a single enhanced platform under the Wyndham Vacation Rentals brand umbrella. 
In RCI, our business development teams have added over 75 resorts to our system through midyear. We announced several outstanding new affiliations, including the Baha Mar Residence Club, which will provide RCI members with access to more than 300 luxury Caribbean units, managed by such world-class brands as Rosewood and Mondrian.
In the technology front, we completed another successful release of rci.com, which included an upgrade to an innovative click-to-chat functionality with multiple language support. From when we started the project in the first quarter of 2008 to the end of 2012, we expect our migration to online transactions to improve our Exchange and Rentals margin by over 225 basis points. Enhanced online experience also increases the overall value proposition to our members with greater functionality and better online content. The result is that online transactions in the second quarter were 41% of total transactions compared with 13% when we began the project 4 years ago. 
Finally, let's turn to Vacation Ownership. WVO continued to achieve stellar results, with revenue increasing 5% and EBITDA increasing 15%. Tour flow and volume per guest remained strong, aided by our credit prescreening tool. In addition to achieving significant efficiencies, the team has continued to refine its business model to support our focus on free cash flow. Our first step was establishing the Wyndham vacation -- the Wyndham Asset Affiliation Model or WAAM, which positions us to offer turnkey solutions for developers' or banks' holding inventory, which we sell for a fee through our industry-leading sales and marketing channels. In 2011, with healthy conditions in the ABS market, we introduced WAAM 2.0, where we not only sell third-party inventory, but also offer consumer loans. Our goal is to capture the attractive spreads available through financing and preserve our capital lite operating philosophy. We signed our first WAAM 2.0 deal late last year and began sales in the second quarter of 2012. Tom will walk you through the accounting on this later. 
Finally, regarding a corporate matter. As you may know, we are in litigation with the FTC regarding Wyndham Hotel's data security and privacy practices in relation to data breaches that occurred from 2008 to 2010, in which a limited amount of consumer information at some Wyndham Hotels and Resort branded properties may have been accessed. Let me first say that we've cooperated fully with the FTC in its investigation of these data breaches and that safeguarding consumer information is a priority for us. We believe the FTC's claims are without merit, and we will vigorously defend our position. Regardless, we do not believe that the outcome of the litigation will have a material effect on our company. 
But before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to note a special anniversary. Next week, we will celebrate the 6th year anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. I'd like to take a moment to evaluate our performance for shareholders over those years. 
Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $2.7 billion to our shareholders through the end of the second quarter. A cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 29% reduction in our share count. And our total return to shareholders including dividends has been 81% compared with 21% for the S&P 500. We're never being satisfied. We know we still have great opportunities to build on these accomplishments. Tom?"
31063165,209942307,330516,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2012",2012-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Let me start with brief comments on the overall quarterly results, and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance. As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue to",1717,"Thank you, Steve. Let me start with brief comments on the overall quarterly results, and then provide some detail into business unit performance and guidance. 
As we've said in the past, our results are the outcome of sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, stronger operational execution at each of our business units and disciplined capital allocation. Overall, our second quarter results, again, were strong, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 36% above the same period in 2011 for the second quarter in a row and $0.02 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect solid performance in our Lodging and Vacation Ownership businesses and a meaningful impact from our ongoing share repurchase program. 
We continue to generate high levels of free cash flow and, consistent with our capital allocation strategy, return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while actively seeking value-enhancing acquisitions in our core businesses. In the first 6 months of 2012, free cash flow increased to $567 million or $3.83 per share, compared with $544 million or $3.13 per share during the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of $51 million of VAT refund received last year. We expect that our available cash for the year, which includes net proceeds from ABS financings and assumes we'll calibrate leverage to our increased EBITDA, will be approximately $1 billion. [ph] 
With our strong free cash flow, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock in the second quarter of 2012 for a total of $190 million. Taking into account the additional 1.1 million shares purchased thus far during quarter 3, we have $733 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
Now moving to operating performance for the quarter. Let's start with Wyndham Hotel Group. Revenues were up 23% and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% compared with the second quarter of 2011, reflecting an increase in franchise royalties and higher intersegment fees for the use of the Wyndham brand. Excluding the intersegment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. The revenue increase also included $10 million of reporting reclassifications and $11 million of incremental global franchise conference fees, both of which were fully offset by expenses.
Domestic RevPAR improved by 8% in the second quarter, while systemwide RevPAR increased 5%. North American RevPAR improvement was driven primarily by an increase in the average daily rate, further evidence of a positive trend in pricing power in our segments. This bodes well for continued Lodging recovery. Internationally, RevPAR was up 2% in constant currency. 
The system size was essentially unchanged, with gross openings of 15,500 and terminations of 16,400. Openings were in line with expectations, while terminations were higher than expected as a result of some proactive steps on our part to address underperforming franchisees. Note that we expect 3,022 rooms from the HPT transaction that Steve mentioned earlier to enter the system on August 1. Net overall pipeline activity is up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. 
Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. Again, this quarter, our Exchange and Rentals business demonstrated solid performance in the face of a difficult European macroeconomic environment and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. As Steve articulated, we have great confidence in both our Exchange and Rental businesses based on the quality of the management teams, product offerings and our mostly fee-for-service business models. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, revenues for the quarter were flat compared to the same period 2011. Excluding acquisitions in foreign currency, adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, but flat if you exclude a $4 million claim settlement related to the Gulf oil spill. 
The constant currency second quarter Vacation Exchange revenues were flat. Exchange revenue per member increased by 2% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher Exchange fees. Average number of members declined 2% in the quarter due to the expected nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012. 
Vacation Rental revenues were down $10 million for the quarter, unfavorably impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. If you are to exclude the impact from acquisitions and the net effect of foreign currency, Vacation Rental revenues were flat. Transaction volumes were down 3% due to weak economic conditions in Europe, offset by a 4% increase in the average net price per rental, primarily driven by a higher yield at our Hoseasons Group in the U.K. and Landal GreenParks business in Holland. 
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. The business again delivered another outstanding quarter. Compared to the prior year, segment revenues increased by $29 million or 5%, primarily due to the positive impacts of higher VPG and increased tour flow. Year-over-year gross VOI sales increased by $48 million or 12%. Year-to-date, we have brought 13,500 new owners into the system, an increase of 10% over the same period in 2011 and consistent with our annual goal of 27,000 new owners.
WAAM 1.0 volume was $18 million for the quarter. In addition, as Steve mentioned earlier, we began selling WAAM 2.0 products in June, with volume of $12 million by quarter end. As a reminder, the accounting for WAAM 2.0 transactions will run inventory through our balance sheet in a just-in-time basis. So we'll record the inventory on the balance sheet at registration and pay for the inventory shortly after each sales transaction. Note that at the end of the second quarter, approximately $60 million of inventory on the balance sheet was related to WAAM 2.0. 
WAAM 2.0 enables us to capture the attractive consumer finance EBITDA, while optimizing the balance sheet and cash flow. Combined WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0 revenues showed a 58% increase over the same period of 2011. Consistent with our commitment to provide timely disclosures, we have added the break out of WAAM 1.0 and WAAM 2.0 to Tables 3 and Table 9 of our press release.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $150 million, up 15% compared with the second quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects the strong increase in VOI sales. Now if we were to exclude the higher intersegment licensing fee paid for the use of the Wyndham brand name, adjusted EBITDA actually increases 19%. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Writeoffs during the second quarter were $77 million, slightly up from the $75 million a year ago. The provision for loan losses was $100 million compared with $80 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and limited improvement in portfolio performance. 
Now while the portfolio remains strong overall, we had hoped to see more improvement in performance by now. We've looked closely at the limited improvement in portfolio performance over the past few months and attribute it primarily to the pace and strength of the economic recovery. But while there's nothing that we can do about the economy, we have dramatically improved our buyer profile. In addition, we believe there are 2 other factors at play here: first, recent portfolio performance has been affected by an organized third-party scam where fraudulent representatives were calling our customers and encouraging them to default on their loans. We have worked with authorities, and these parties have been indicted. We believe this issue is now under control. Second, we are seeing an impact from some owners holding balances higher than historic norms. Typically, loan performance diminishes as loan balances increase. And these loans are affecting overall portfolio performance. We are putting plans in place to mitigate the effect of these very manageable issues, and we'll keep you updated as we progress.
ABS capital markets remain robust. On July 19, we closed a $300 million timeshare securitization with an advanced rate of 90% and a weighted average coupon of 2.66%, another great execution. We couldn't be happier with the results. 
Finally, corporate expenses, as well as interest expense were in line with our expectations. 
Having completed our 5-year plan review process, we are solidly on course with our long term goals. We are committed to EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, with high single to low double-digit growth in the Hotel Group and mid-single-digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We remain committed to an investment grade profile, which will enable us to increase debt by $300 million for every $100 million that we add in EBITDA. The result is $1 billion of available cash to deploy each year to increase shareholder value. 2 years ago, we shared that the deployment of that cash through M&A and share repurchase would result in compound annual EPS growth of between 17% and 21% over the subsequent 5-year period. Well, we're well on our way to achieving and exceeding that goal. 
Now finally, I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. Full year revenue guidance is unchanged. We are, however, raising the lower end of EBITDA guidance with a new range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. In the business units, we expect Vacation Ownership and Lodging revenues and adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of their respective ranges. We expect Exchange and Rentals revenues to be at the low end of its range and adjusted EBITDA to be at the midpoint of its range. Also, we expect corporate expense to be at the high end of the numeric range, while depreciation and amortization will be at the low end of the numeric range. 
Business unit driver guidance remains unchanged. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.10 to $3.20. Our prior guidance was $3 to $3.15. The new adjusted EPS guidance is based on the expected diluted share count of 147 million shares. Remember that our earnings per share guidance excludes any share repurchase beyond June 30, while some analysts' estimates factor in estimated repurchases in the second half of the year. 
In the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $1.07 to $1.10. This is below the consensus, reflecting differences in both share repurchase assumptions and seasonality between the third and fourth quarters. However, our guidance for the second half of the year is consistent with Street expectations. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Well, I'll let Tom address the ABS part of the question. I'll start to tackle the European Rental question. Again, looking within the quarter, because I think it was your first question, did we see any trending? Within markets, we do see trending every month and every week, and that's because of weather. I mean, the weather has been miserable. For those who watched the British Open recently, the announcers just kept talking about how miserable the weather has been over there. And that -- we never complained about the weather, but that does have an impact. So when you see trending, the economy has something to do with it, but the weather does as well because people are driving to these locations. So do we see any trending? Steve, I wouldn't say there was any trending that I would say was meaningful. We saw pockets that were stronger as the period went on. We saw pockets that were a little bit weaker. But nothing that I would say was giving us any reason to pause, frankly. And with respect to the pricing over there, I think if you take out the FX impact, you'll actually see that the average price increased about 4%. So that business definitely is being impacted by foreign currency translation. We feel really good about how those brands performed over there. The management did a terrific job. We didn't panic and try to drop price at all. They held price, and the transaction volume picked up and we ended up the quarter very strong. And I will make one comment, Steve, because I don't know if was on your question or not, but you did ask me the last quarter, looking into the -- because we have pretty good booking visibility into this summer for the Rental business, and we feel it's pretty consistent with what we've seen so far that we're not going to see a huge uptick, but we're not seeing any decline that we think is meaningful.

We've done that in some of our new construction product, the Wingates that we've brought on. So we do it on a selective basis, but to become a general lender to the industry, it's just not our business. We're not wired or set up to do that."

The third quarter results reflect continued strong operations, as well as our ongoing commitment to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. While there are some noise related to FX in the numbers these quarters, especially in Exchange and Rental, in the constant currency basis, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 6% and adjusted earnings per share increased 24%. 
Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from domestic RevPAR increases, Wyndham Exchange and Rental continued to deliver solid results despite the economic turmoil in Europe and our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, continued to join tour flow and VPG growth, while delivering on our new owners goals.
In terms of our capital allocation, in addition to 2 tuck-in acquisitions we completed in the quarter, we used $133 million to purchase 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased 10.9 million shares for $522 million. This reflects our consistently strong cash flow and our confidence in the company's prospects. We continue to believe that our stock is a great investment.
The capital allocation philosophy is consistent and is built to drive shareholder value. We would invest in our core businesses, pay dividends, repurchase shares and do opportunistic accretive acquisitions. Now moving to our business unit review.
In the Hotel group, industry fundamentals continue to improve, albeit at a slower pace. Our RevPAR recovery seems to be moderating, we believe development opportunities are expanding. This bodes well for room growth as we go forward.
With our stronger brands, we are exceptionally well-positioned to capture franchise and management opportunities, giving owners the ability to choose the right flag to best maximize their assets. For example, in India, we led with Ramada, a established international brand, and then introduced the Wyndham, Days Inn and Howard Johnson brands. In China, we began in the 90s with Days Inn and Howard Johnson master franchises and added Super 8, again a master franchise and then Ramada as a direct franchising in 2004. Since then we have introduced Ramada and Encore and TRYP and Wyndham, resulting in a total presence of over 63,000 rooms. 
Looking at our recent opportunities, I just returned from a 7-day trip to Brazil and Uruguay to visit the large customers and prospects for both our RCI and hotel businesses. There's strong hotel and timeshare growth in Brazil right now, and our participation in that growth is another great example of why brand footprint creates enhanced development opportunities. 
We are in Brazil with our TRYP by Wyndham Grand, and we have seen great demand for our other offerings including Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Wyndham. Developers understand the value of our distribution capabilities, as well as the opportunity of our multiple brand strategy and they are eager to partner with us.
Building alliances with multiunit developers has proven successful in growing international regions. Also in the Hotel group, we continue to make excellent progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives, aimed to improve the value proposition to our franchisees by maximizing our system contribution. 
In August, we relaunched the Wyndham Hotel and resorts website, completing the most complex project of our brand.com initiative. We have now completely revamped 13 brand websites, significantly enhancing features, functionality and content for over 7,000 properties. Room nights resulting from brand.com initiative are up 17% versus prior year on both the year-to-date and the quarterly basis. 
Another phase of Apollo, we are embracing the significant shift to mobile devices by improving our click-to-chat functionality that simplifies the booking process and enhances the consumer experience.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rental. During the seasonally largest quarter of the year, the team continue to do a great job, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in broader timeshare industry. 4 of our 5 European rental businesses had increases in transaction volume without significant discounting. This speaks to our leadership in the industry and our ability to grow transactions. 
This is how our service rental model works. All of our properties are backed by the Wyndham service commitment, giving both owners and consumers peace of mind in their rental experience. We provided our owners and guest with a high level of service, marketing, managing their calendar, handing the booking and payment process, providing check-in and checkout services and maintaining quality standards through property inspections. This is very different from the listings model, which typically provides only online marketing dividend on the field from perspective guest, update and maintain their availability calendars, provide key holding, check-in and checkout services to guest, address service and property issues for guest during their stay, and ultimately, handle the collections process. We have over 40 years of experience in vacation rental and follow disciplined approach to developing new markets.
Development model in Europe was designed to minimize risk in the early stages and maximize profit once the market is ready. Initially, we analyzed the market and establish a network with local tourist organizations to help develop demand. We then test our brand in the market in a small scale. We begin property recruitment efforts through our partnership with third parties in the market such as travel agents, with minimal internal cost and risk. Once critical mass has been reached, we will make a full-scale entry to realize the potential of the market.
This is a attested improvement approach, and Croatia is a great example. We entered in Croatia in 2004 and so less than 200 weeks. In 2012, we're the market leader and we have already sold over 30,000 weeks for September. The key to our strategy to Europe and in the U.S. is applying best practices across our businesses and leveraging our core competencies in marketing and analytics.
We also supplement growth through M&A. For example, in August, we continue to expand our vacation rental business in the United States with the acquisition of a leading vacation rental company located at the main entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. This is America's busiest national Park attracted over 9 million visitors each year. We think the acquisition is a great addition to our portfolio.
Moving to the Exchange business, we've just completed the latest release of rci.com, which delivered several new advancements, including web enablement of our points exchange transactions on mobile devices, the ability to cross-sell using predictive modeling to provide offers uniquely tailored to our members needs and wants and the introduction of first fully transactional and translated Chinese website in the global vacation exchange industry. This is the final major release of our successful 4-year rci.com mission, which has greatly enhanced the value we bring to our members, as well as our efficiency.
Rci.com has launched several industry first, including RCI TV, enhanced search, RCI Platinum, trading power transparency, combining deposits and change back. We are on-track to reduce call volume by over 30% from the inception of the project through year end 2012, and we expect a total reduction of almost 40% by 2015. We've driven online web share from 13% to currently over 40% and it's still climbing. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a busy and productive quarter. In September, we acquired Shell Vacations, which brought us approximately 150,000 owners and 19 managed resorts in North America. WVO will now operate Shell Vacations club, leading points based club system, featuring a wide variety of member benefits and travel options. 
As Tom will discuss, this tuck-in acquisition has a healthy rate of return. It is immediately accretive to earnings and will generate meaningful cash flow. With strong fee-for-service revenues, the acquisition is consistent with our capital light strategy. We look forward to building upon those many achievements and continuing the growth that is highly successful vacation club by providing outstanding quality, value and customer care.
In timeshare, businesses attract -- it is a business that has great returns, high customer satisfaction and a great future. Interestingly, the demographic is broadening. Recent buyers are younger and the ownership base has shifted slightly in terms of marital status, with the lower percentage of married owners and a higher percentage of singles. According to recently released biannual consumer survey, the typical timeshare owner today has medium household income of $74,000. 89% own their primary residence, 64% do not have children at home and 58% are college graduates with over 1/3 of those owners have graduate degrees. The results also showed that 83% of timeshare owners user experience is good to excellent.
Timeshare owners love the product for a variety of reasons, including resort locations, saving money on future vacations, the overall flexibility of the product including the opportunity to exchange and the discipline of taking vacations every year. Clearly, timeshare offers an attractive value proposition for consumers. This both bodes well for our own timeshare business and also for RCI.
Finally, as you saw from the press release, we are giving a first view of our 2013 outlook. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth is consistent with our long-term strategy. Our Investor theme has been excellent execution and powerful cash flow data drive dependable growth. 3 years ago, we laid out a plan that resulted in EPS growth of 17% to 20% over the following 5 years, with the proper allocation of our strong and sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We are well on our way to achieving that plan and much more. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Overall, our third quarter results were solid, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 20% above the same period in 2011 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range.

Overall, our third quarter results were solid, with adjusted earnings per share coming in 20% above the same period in 2011 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect the sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, strong operational execution in all of our businesses and the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Through the first 9 months of 2012, we generated $682 million or $4.61 per share of free cash flow, compared with $636 million or $3.74 per share during the same period in 2011. And that excludes the impact of a $67 million benefit from a VAT refund and related interest income received late last year.
We used the majority of our year-to-date cash flow to repurchase shares. We repurchased $133 million in the third quarter for a 9-month total repurchase of $473 million, plus an additional $49 million on October.
As Steve mentioned and consistent with our capital allocation strategy, on September 13, we acquired Shell Vacations ownership club and property management group. The purchase price was $96 million net of cash, plus $157 million of debt, primarily related to consumer loan receivables. 
As tuck-in acquisition, we'll increase our Vacation Ownership fee-for-service property management EBITDA by approximately 10%. From an earnings perspective, the deal will be minimally accretive on an adjusted basis into fourth quarter, and we expect it to add a few pennies to our 2013 EPS.
On the balance sheet, you'll see an increase of approximately $126 million in consumer finance receivables and an increase, an inventory of about $41 million related to the acquisition. We expect after-tax unlevered returns of close to 20%, which, of course, is above our hurdle rate.
As you saw from the press release and as Steve mentioned, currency had a significant effect on the results in the third quarter. And we evaluate business unit performance, we look at the results in local currency and exclude the impact of foreign exchange. In accordance with GAAP, our reported numbers include this effect, so we are meaningful as I'll highlight results in constant currency.
In Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues were up 12% and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% compared with the third quarter of 2011. Attributable to domestic RevPAR gains, our Wyndham Grand hotel in Orlando and higher interest segment fees. Excluding the higher interest segment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased by 21%. System-wide RevPAR improved by 5% in the third quarter, driven equally by increases in the average daily rate and occupancy. System-wide RevPAR increased 2% with a 5% decline in international RevPAR, offsetting the stronger domestic results. In constant currency, system-wide RevPAR is up 3%.
Now the decline in the international RevPAR reflects a mix effect, driven by the growth in Asia, our lowest RevPAR region. Over the past year, we have increased the number of hotels in our Asia-Pacific region by 26%. This rapid growth has a diluted impact on system-wide RevPAR due to Asia Pacific's relevantly low RevPAR compared to North America and other international regions. 
Compounding the effect, our lower RevPAR brands, specifically Super 8, are growing more rapidly than our higher RevPAR brands in China. This creates an interesting dynamic, persistent growth can reduce RevPAR while increasing earnings. Further the point, on a reported basis, RevPAR Asia Pacific was down 9%, however, same-store RevPAR was up 1%. Excluding the mix effect, same-store international RevPAR was up by 2% in constant currency. System-wide was up 1% year-over-year with net openings of 11,500 rooms, partially driven by multiunit deals, such as the recent Hospitality Properties Trust transaction, which consisted of 20 properties and 3,000 rooms throughout the United States. 
As Steve mentioned earlier, emerging markets such as Brazil and China are driving international room growth, which now accounts for nearly 20% of the portfolio, compared with 26% during the same period in 2011.
Overall, pipeline activity is down 5% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily related to the openings in our Asia-Pacific regions. Our overall development efforts remain on-track. 
Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, which Steve said, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry, the business had another solid quarter. Excluding the effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were flat compared to the same period in 2011. 
In constant currency, third quarter vacation exchange revenues were flat. The average number of members declined 2%, reflecting the non-renewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012, while exchange revenue per member increased by 1% compared to the same period last year. 
Looking at rentals, excluding the net effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, third quarter 2012 revenues, compared with the same period in 2011, were flat. Transaction volumes were up 3%, primarily driven by better penetration in recently developed Novasol markets and improved results in our Hoseasons Group business despite continued softness in the U.K. market. These gains were offset by a 2% decline in the average net price per vacation rental, reflecting a mix shift to lower-priced markets.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This a business delivered another strong quarter completed the prior year, revenues increased by $49 million or 9%, primarily due to positive VOI results. Year-over-year, growth VOI increased by $47 million or 10%. The improvement reflects a 5% increase in both VPG and tour flow. The VPG increase was attributable to both higher pricing due to better yield management and improved closed rates, resulting in part from our credit prescreening program. Tour flow reflects a focus on marketing programs directed to new owner generation.
Year-to-date, we have brought almost 22,000 new owners into the system, an increase of 5% over the same period in 2011, and we are on-track for our annual goal of 27,000 new owners. 
Total gross VOI sales from WAAM increased to $62 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared with $38 million in the prior year, a 63% increase. This growth reflects sales of the second phase of one of our initial WAAM projects in the Orlando. The first phase launched 2 two years ago was the WAAM 1.0. This new phase is WAAM 2.0. We believe this demonstrates both the success of our overall WAAM program and developers interest in various WAAM models. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year, right also during the third quarter improved somewhat to $71 million, down from $73 million the prior year. The provision for loan losses $124 million compared with $96 million in the third quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and challenges in portfolio performance, which we discussed with you last quarter. This challenges reflects higher default levels due to the larger loan balances and some third-party fraud affecting loan defaults. Remediation plans are in place and we are monitoring the situation closely. We expect to provisions of moderate going forward, and we will keep you updated on our progress.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $155 million, up 4% compared with the third quarter of 2011. The increase primarily reflects the revenue increases, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses related to the increase in VOI sales and higher interest segment licensing fees for use of the Wyndham brand trade name. Now excluding these higher fees, adjusted EBITDA for WVO is up 7%.
Now on a corporate financing front, recently launched a new commercial paper program. This program, which is already in use, allows us to borrow short-term funds at even lower rates than our revolving credit facility. Overall debt levels will be unaffected by this facility. 
As Steve noted, our long-term corporate goals remain unchanged. We are targeting an annual EBITDA growth of 6%to 8%, high-single to low double-digit growth in our Hotel group and mid-single-digit growth in the Exchange and Rental group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We will continue to manage our balance sheet magics metrics consistent with the investment grade profile, which enable  us to increase debt by $300 million, $100 million that we add in EBITDA. 
No I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full-year revenue guidance range to $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. We are also narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.20 per share. 
The new EPS guidance is based on than expected diluted share count of 146 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 147 million shares. This new guidance on reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter and excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately $608 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Now let's touch on a few modifications regarding final 2012 driver guidance. For the full-year, we expect RevPAR to come in at the lower end of our guidance range, while tours and VPG will come in at the upper end of our guidance ranges. 
Our 2013 outlook reflects continued momentum in the businesses. We expect revenues of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000, EBITDA of $1,125,000,000 to $1,150,000,000, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. The share count assumption includes our share repurchase through September 30, 2012. Also assume that our 2013 EPS guidance is higher depreciation and amortization expense based on the Shell acquisition, as well as a some capital projects and IT initiatives being put into service. We'll give you, of course, full guidance on our February call.
Finally, we expect free cash flow of between $600 million and $700 million in 2013, and available cash of close to $1 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

So we hope that the tightening of those underwriting standards will help us to both retain momentum in VPG, while dealing with some of the large balance loans situation. As it relates to the second factor, which is the disorganized productivity, we started some months ago to pursue very aggressive legal tactics with some of these third parties. We feel like it's a bit like a guacamole situation, but we think that we've addressed some of the major sources of this productivity in a pretty significant way. So we expect to see an improvement in that area, probably more rapidly within the next few months, we expect to see some improvement."

There will be some optics in our balance sheet that would look no different on the WAAM 2.0. Think of WAAM 2.0 as like just-in-time inventory model, where it will go, inventory will appear on our balance sheet, there will be a cash expenditure for that inventory. When we sell a WAAM 2.0 ownership right, we will almost simultaneously pay for the inventory and provide the inventory to the buyer. So it's a much more efficient cash flow model, some of the optics in the balance sheet and we'll start to get into it more as becomes a bigger part of our business. It will be a bit different. The revenue classification will be gross VOI, it won't be commissioned. So you will see the commission line on our financial statements start to wane a bit. But from a margin perspective, from a margin perspective, it's going to be include, of course, the interest income that we get from WAAM 2.0 is whole different this category so the margin that we VOI margin that we get will be comparable but the interest income, of course, will add an incremental EBITDA that they will receive WAAM 1.0 participants."

The way we build our pipeline for deals as we look at our sales plan, what we expect to do over the coming years and we back into what inventory we need and what locations. So I think I mentioned in the last call that we will look at 150 deals this year, we're only going to do a couple of them because they're exactly what we want. But that doesn't mean that half of them didn't make sense and couldn't it be done in the future. So there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity out here. I think that this WAAM 2.0 or whatever our next generation will be and more constantly, we're constantly tweaking and improving this process. This group down in Orlando and our real estate team here in are incredibly innovative and come up with new ways of approaching this. So stay tuned. I'm sure we'll be talking about other ways that we find access inventory that is on a capital-light way that can improve our cash flow and the dynamic of the business."

The third quarter results reflect continued strong operations, as well as our ongoing commitment to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. While there's some noise related to FX in the numbers this quarter",1598,"Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results reflect continued strong operations, as well as our ongoing commitment to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. While there's some noise related to FX in the numbers this quarter, especially in Exchange and Rentals, on a constant currency basis, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 6% and adjusted earnings per share increased 24%. 
Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from domestic RevPAR increases. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals continued to deliver solid results despite the economic turmoil in Europe, and our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, continued to drive tour flow and VPG growth while delivering on our new owner goals.
In terms of our capital allocation, in addition to 2 tuck-in acquisitions we completed in the quarter, we used $133 million to purchase 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased 10.9 million shares for $522 million. This reflects our consistently strong cash flow and our confidence in the company's prospects. We continue to believe that our stock is a great investment. Our capital allocation philosophy is consistent and is built to drive shareholder value. We will invest in our core businesses, pay dividends, repurchase shares and do opportunistic accretive acquisitions. 
Now moving to our business unit review. With the Hotel group, industry fundamentals continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace. While RevPAR recovery seems to be moderating, we believe development opportunities are expanding. This bodes well for room growth as we go forward. With our strong array of brands, we are exceptionally well positioned to capture franchise and management opportunities, giving owners the ability to choose the right flag to best maximize their assets. 
For example, in India, we led with Ramada, an established international brand, and then introduced the Wyndham, Days Inn and Howard Johnson brands. In China, we began in the '90s with Days Inn and Howard Johnson master franchises and added Super 8, again a master franchise, and then Ramada as a direct franchise in 2004. Since then, we have introduced Ramada Encore, TRYP and Wyndham, resulting in a total presence of over 63,000 rooms. 
Looking at more recent opportunities. I just returned from a 7-day trip to Brazil and Uruguay to visit the large customers and prospects for both our RCI and hotel businesses. There is strong hotel and timeshare growth in Brazil right now, and our participation in that growth is another great example of wide-brand footprint creates enhanced development opportunities. We are in Brazil with our TRYP by Wyndham brand and have seen great demand for our other offerings, including Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Wyndham. 
Developers understand the value of our distribution capabilities, as well as the opportunity of our multiple brand strategy, and they are eager to partner with us. Building strategic alliances with multiunit developers has proven successful in growing international regions. Also, in the Hotel group, we continue to make excellent progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives that aim to improve the value proposition to our franchisees by maximizing our system contribution. 
In August, we relaunched the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts website, completing the most complex project of our brand.com initiative. We have now completely revamped 13 brand websites, significantly enhancing features, functionality and content for over 7,000 properties. Room nights resulting from brand.com initiative are up 17% versus prior year on both a year-to-date and a quarterly basis. With another phase of Apollo, we are embracing the significant shift to mobile devices by improving our click-to-chat functionality that simplifies the booking process and enhances the consumer experience.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. During the seasonally largest quarter of the year, the team continued to do a great job, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in broader timeshare industry. 4 of our 5 European rental businesses had increases in transaction volume without significant discounting. This speaks to our leadership in the industry and our ability to grow transactions. 
Here's how our service rental model works. All of our properties are backed by the Wyndham service commitment, giving both owners and consumers peace of mind in their rental experience. We provide our owners and guest with a high level of service, marketing, managing their calendar, handling the booking and payment process, providing check-in and checkout services and maintaining quality standards through property inspections. 
This is very different from the listings model, which typically provides only online marketing, leaving it to the owner to field inquiries from prospective guest, update and maintain their availability calendars, provide key holding, check-in and checkout services to guests, address service and property issues for guests during their stay and ultimately, handle the collection process. We have over 40 years experience of vacation rental and follow a disciplined approach to developing new markets.
The development model in Europe was designed to minimize risk in the early stages and maximize profit once the market is ready. Initially, we analyze the market and establish a network with local tourist organizations to help develop demand. We then test our brand in the market on a small scale. We begin property recruitment efforts through partnership with third parties in the market, such as travel agents, with minimal internal cost and risk. Once critical mass has been reached, we will make a full-scale entry to realize the potential of the market.
This is a tested and proven approach, and Croatia is a great example. We entered Croatia in 2004, and so less than 200 weeks. In 2012, we're the market leader, and we have already sold over 30,000 weeks through September. The key to our strategy in Europe and in the U.S. is applying best practices across our businesses and leveraging our core competencies in marketing and analytics.
We also supplement growth through M&A. For example, in August, we continue to expand our vacation rental business in the United States with the acquisition of a leading vacation rental company located at the main entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. This is America's busiest national park, attracting over 9 million visitors each year. We think the acquisition is a great addition to our portfolio.
Moving to the Exchange business. We've just completed the latest release of rci.com, which delivered several new advancements, including web enablement of our points exchange transactions on mobile devices, the ability of -- to cross-sell products using predictive modeling to provide offers uniquely tailored to our members needs and wants and the introduction of the first fully transactional and translated Chinese website in the global vacation exchange industry. This is the final major release of our successful 4-year rci.com mission, which has greatly enhanced the value we bring to our members, as well as our efficiency.
rci.com has launched several industry-firsts, including RCI TV, enhanced search, RCI Platinum, trading power transparency, combining deposits and change back. We are on track to reduce call volume by over 30% from the inception of the project through year-end 2012, and we expect a total reduction of almost 40% by 2015. We've driven online web share from 13% to currently over 40%, and it's still climbing. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a busy and productive quarter. In September, we acquired Shell Vacations, which brought us approximately 115,000 owners and 19 managed resorts in North America. WVO will now operate Shell Vacation Club, a leading points-based club system, featuring a wide variety of member benefits and travel options. 
As Tom will discuss, this tuck-in acquisition has a healthy rate of return, is immediately accretive to earnings and will generate meaningful cash flow. With strong fee-for-service revenues, the acquisition was consistent with our capital-light strategy. We look forward to building upon Shell's many achievements and continuing the growth of this highly successful vacation club by providing outstanding quality, value and customer care.
The timeshare business is attractive because it is a business that has great returns, high customer satisfaction and a great future. Interestingly, the demographic is broadening. Recent buyers are younger, and the ownership base has shifted slightly in terms of marital status with a lower percentage of married owners and a higher percentage of singles. 
According to ARDA's recently released biannual consumer survey, the typical timeshare owner today has medium household income of $74,000, 89% own their primary residence, 64% do not have children at home and 58% are college graduates with over 1/3 of those owners have graduate degrees. The ARDA results also showed that 83% of timeshare owners say their experience is good to excellent.
Timeshare owners love the product for a variety of reasons, including resort locations; saving money on future vacations; the overall flexibility of the product, including the opportunity to exchange; and the discipline of taking vacations every year. Clearly, timeshare offers an attractive value proposition for consumers. This bodes well for our own timeshare business and also, for RCI.
Finally, as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first view of our 2013 outlook. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth is consistent with our long-term strategy. Our investor theme has been excellent execution and powerful cash flow drive dependable growth. Three years ago, we laid out a plan that resulted in EPS growth of 17% to 20% over the following 5 years with the proper allocation of our strong and sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We are well on our way to achieving that plan and much more. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
31063165,222400075,368903,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Overall, our third quarter results were solid with adjusted earnings per share coming in 20% above the same period in 2011 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect the sound strategies that we continue to adv",1673,"Thanks, Steve. Overall, our third quarter results were solid with adjusted earnings per share coming in 20% above the same period in 2011 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect the sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, strong operational execution in all of our businesses and the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Through the first 9 months of 2012, we generated $682 million or $4.61 per share of free cash flow compared with $636 million or $3.74 per share during the same period in 2011. That excludes the impact of a $67 million benefit from a VAT refund and related interest income received late last year. We used the majority of our year-to-date cash flow to repurchase shares. We repurchased $133 million in the third quarter for a 9-month total repurchase of $473 million, plus an additional $49 million in October.
As Steve mentioned and consistent with our capital allocation strategy, on September 13, we acquired Shell Vacation ownership club and property management group. The purchase price was $96 million net of cash, plus $157 million of debt primarily related to consumer loan receivables. As tuck-in acquisition, we'll increase our vacation ownership fee-for-service property management EBITDA by approximately 10%. 
From an earnings perspective, the deal will be minimally accretive on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to add a few pennies to our 2013 EPS. On the balance sheet, you'll see an increase of approximately $126 million in consumer finance receivables and an increase in inventory of about $41 million related to the acquisition. We expect after-tax unlevered returns of close to 20%, which, of course, is above our hurdle rate.
As you saw from the press release and as Steve mentioned, currency had a significant effect on the results in the third quarter. When we evaluate business unit performance, we look at the results in local currency and exclude the impact of foreign exchange. In accordance with GAAP, our reported numbers include this effect, so were meaningful. I shall highlight results in constant currency.
At Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues were up 12% and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% compared with the third quarter of 2011, attributable to domestic RevPAR gains, our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and higher intersegment fees. Excluding the higher intersegment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased by 21%. domestic RevPAR improved by 5% in the third quarter, driven equally by increases in the average daily rate and occupancy. Systemwide RevPar increased 2% with a 5% decline in international RevPAR offsetting the stronger domestic results. in constant currency, systemwide RevPAR is up 3%.
Now the decline in the international RevPAR reflects a mix effect, driven by the growth in Asia, our lowest RevPAR region. Over the past year, we have increased the number of hotels in our Asia-Pacific region by 26%. This rapid growth has a diluted impact on systemwide RevPAR due to Asia Pacific's relatively low RevPAR compared to North America and other international regions. Compounding the effect, our lower RevPAR brands, specifically Super 8, are growing more rapidly than our higher RevPAR brands in China. This creates an interesting dynamic. Persistent growth can reduce RevPAR while increasing earnings. 
Further to the point, on a reported basis, RevPAR in Asia Pacific was down 9%. However, same-store RevPAR was up 1%. Excluding the mix effect, same-store international RevPAR was up by 2% in constant currency. System size was up 1% year-over-year with net openings of 11,500 rooms, partially driven by multiunit deals, such as the recent Hospitality Properties Trust transaction, which consisted of 20 properties and 3,000 rooms throughout the United States. 
As Steve mentioned earlier, emerging markets, such as Brazil and China, are driving international room growth, which now accounts for nearly 28% of the portfolio, compared with 26% during the same period in 2011. Overall, pipeline activity is down 5% both year-over-year and sequentially primarily related to the openings in our Asia-Pacific region. Our overall development efforts remain on track. 
Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. As Steve said, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry, the business had another solid quarter. Excluding the effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were flat compared to the same period in 2011. In constant currency, third quarter vacation exchange revenues were flat. The average number of members declined 2%, reflecting the nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012, while exchange revenue per member increased by 1% compared with the same period last year. 
Looking at rentals. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, third quarter 2012 revenues compared with the same period in 2011 were flat. Transaction volumes were up 3% primarily driven by better penetration in recently developed Novasol markets and improved results in our Hoseasons Group business despite continued softness in the U.K. market. These gains were offset by a 2% decline in the average net price per vacation rental, reflecting a mix shift to lower-priced markets.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered another strong quarter. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased by $49 million or 9% primarily due to positive VOI results. Year-over-year, gross VOI increased by $47 million or 10%. The improvement reflects a 5% increase in both VPG and tour flow. VPG increase was attributable to both higher pricing due to better yield management and improved close rates, resulting in part from our credit prescreening program. Tour flow reflects a focus on marketing programs directed to new owner generation. Year-to-date, we have brought almost 22,000 new owners into the system, an increase of 5% over the same period in 2011, and we are on track for our annual goal of 27,000 new owners. 
Total gross VOI sales from WAAM increased to $62 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the prior year, a 63% increase. This growth reflects sales of the second phase of one of our initial WAAM projects near Orlando. The first phase launched 2 years ago was the WAAM 1.0. This new phase is WAAM 2.0. We believe this demonstrates both the success of our overall WAAM program and developers' interest in various WAAM models. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Writeoffs during the third quarter improved somewhat to $71 million, down from $73 million in the prior year. The provision for loan loss was $124 million compared with $96 million in the third quarter of 2011 primarily reflecting higher sales and challenges in portfolio performance, which we discussed with you last quarter. These challenges reflect higher default levels due to larger loan balances and some third-party fraud affecting loan defaults. Remediation plans are in place, and we are monitoring the situation closely. We expect the provision to moderate going forward, and we will keep you updated on our progress.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $155 million, up 4% compared with the third quarter of 2011. The increase primarily reflects the revenue increases, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses related to the increase in VOI sales and higher intersegment licensing fees for use of the Wyndham brand trade name. Now excluding these higher fees, adjusted EBITDA for WVO was up 7%.
Now on a corporate financing front, we recently launched a new commercial paper program. This program, which is already in use, allows us to borrow short-term funds at even lower rates than our revolving credit facility. Overall debt levels will be unaffected by this facility. 
As Steve noted, our long-term corporate goals remain unchanged. We are targeting annual EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, high-single to low-double digit growth in our Hotel group and mid-single digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We will continue to manage our balance sheet metrics consistent with an investment grade profile, which enable us to increase debt by $300 million for every $100 million that we add in EBITDA. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full year revenue guidance range to $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion and our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. 
We are also narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.20 per share. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 146 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 147 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter and excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately $608 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Now let's touch on a few modifications regarding final 2012 driver guidance. For the full year, we expect RevPAR to come in at the lower end of our guidance range, while tours and VPG will come in at the upper end of our guidance ranges. 
Our 2013 outlook reflects continued momentum in the businesses. We expect revenues of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000; EBITDA of $1,125,000,000 to $1,150,000,000; and adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.60 a share, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. 
The share count assumption includes our share repurchase through September 30, 2012, also assume that our 2013 EPS guidance's higher depreciation and amortization expense based on the Shell acquisition, as well as a some capital projects and IT initiatives being put into service. We'll give you, of course, full guidance on our February call. Finally, we expect free cash flow of between $600 million and $700 million in 2013 and available cash of close to $1 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

And our team in Las Vegas and -- our teams in Las Vegas and Orlando have worked on tightening up some of the underwriting standards on how we lend out money and to whom we'll lend money. So we hope that the tightening of those underwriting standards will help us to both retain momentum in VPG, while dealing with some of the large balance loan situation. As it relates to the second factor, which is this organized fraud activity, we have started some months ago to pursue very aggressive legal tactics with some of these third parties. We feel like it's a bit like a whack-a-mole situation. But we think that we've addressed some of the major sources of this fraud activity in a pretty significant way. So we expect to see improvement in that area, probably more rapidly. Within the next few months, we expect to see some improvement."

There will be some optics on our balance sheet that look a little different. On the WAAM 2.0, think of WAAM 2.0 as like a just-in-time inventory model, where as it will go, inventory will appear on our balance sheet. There won't be a cash expenditure for that inventory. When we sell a WAAM 2.0 ownership right, we will almost simultaneously pay for the inventory and provide the inventory to the buyer. So it's a much more efficient cash flow model, some of the optics on balance sheet, and we'll start to get into it more as it becomes a bigger part of our business. It will be a bit different. The revenue classification will be gross VOI. It won't be commissioned. So you'll see the commission line on our financial statements start to wane a bit. But from a margin perspective, it's going to be improved, of course. The interest income that we get on WAAM 2.0 is a whole different business category, so the margin that we -- the VOI margin that we get will be comparable but the interest income, of course, will add incremental EBITDA that we won't have received had be only been a WAAM 1.0 participant."

Less strong was in the -- on the East Coast and towards the Northeast. So I think there were maybe shifts in some leisure travel during the quarter versus the quarter last year. But it wasn't massive, and it was very hard to tell what is specifically related to our Apollo initiatives. We know that we saw increases of the bookings through our websites. That definitely has picked up. But we don't know how many of those we would've gotten on the call center. We don't know how many of those would have been drive up, so its a little bit difficult to tell with specificity. But I think the biggest parameter is what we hear from our franchisees.

There's factors that are not as readily predictable as in the U.S. that we're trying to monitor closely, plus the fact that we do have master franchisees over there, which gives us less control on the timing, a little more subject to their availability to get those properties open and in the system. So there -- it's mostly that but -- mostly those 2 factors, but the fact is that we have been talking all year that we would see an increase in rooms by the end of the year in part because we saw these HPT transaction coming. But also, there are a number of other opportunities that we're looking at that are large bulk conversions. As I said, I think RevPAR may be moderating. It's still growing, but it may be moderating a little bit. But we definitely see the growth when room opportunity is improving, and so we will be aggressively pursuing that."

Our third quarter results reflect continued strong operations, as well as our ongoing commitment to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. While there's some noise related to FX in the numbers this quarter",1605,"Thanks, Margo, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued strong operations, as well as our ongoing commitment to deploy capital to increase shareholder value. While there's some noise related to FX in the numbers this quarter, especially in Exchange and Rentals, on a constant currency basis, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 24%. 
Each of our business units exceeded our expectations. The Wyndham Hotel Group benefited from domestic RevPAR increases. Wyndham Exchange and Rentals continued to deliver solid results despite the economic turmoil in Europe. And our timeshare business, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, continued to drive tour flow and VPG growth while delivering on our new owner goals.
In terms of our capital allocation, in addition to 2 tuck-in acquisitions we completed in the quarter, we used $133 million to purchase 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased 10.9 million shares for $522 million. This reflects our consistently strong cash flow and our confidence in the company's prospects. We continue to believe that our stock is a great investment. Our capital allocation philosophy is consistent and is built to drive shareholder value. We will invest in our core businesses, pay dividends, repurchase shares and do opportunistic accretive acquisitions. 
Now moving to our business unit review. At the Hotel group, industry fundamentals continue to improve, albeit at a slower pace. While RevPAR recovery seems to be moderating, we believe development opportunities are expanding. This bodes well for room growth as we go forward. With our strong array of brands, we are exceptionally well positioned to capture franchise and management opportunities, giving owners the ability to choose the right flag to best maximize their assets. 
For example, in India, we led with Ramada, an established international brand, and then introduced the Wyndham, Days Inn and Howard Johnson brands. In China, we began in the '90s with Days Inn and Howard Johnson master franchises and added Super 8, again a master franchise, and then Ramada as a direct franchise in 2004. Since then, we have introduced Ramada Encore, TRYP and Wyndham, resulting in a total presence of over 63,000 rooms. 
Looking at more recent opportunities. I just returned from a 7-day trip to Brazil and Uruguay to visit the large customers and prospects for both our RCI and hotel businesses. There is strong hotel and timeshare growth in Brazil right now, and our participation in that growth is another great example of how wide brand footprint creates enhanced development opportunities. We are in Brazil with our TRYP by Wyndham brand and have seen great demand for our other offerings, including Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Wyndham. 
Developers understand the value of our distribution capabilities, as well as the opportunity of our multiple brand strategy, and they are eager to partner with us. Building strategic alliances with multiunit developers has proven successful in growing international regions. Also, in the Hotel group, we continue to make excellent progress on Apollo, our series of technology and business initiatives that aim to improve the value proposition to our franchisees by maximizing our system contribution. 
In August, we relaunched the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts website, completing the most complex project of our brand.com initiative. We have now completely revamped 13 brand websites, significantly enhancing features, functionality and content for over 7,000 properties. Room nights resulting from brand.com initiative are up 17% versus prior year on both a year-to-date and a quarterly basis. In another phase of Apollo, we are embracing the significant shift to mobile devices by improving our click-to-chat functionality, which simplifies the booking process and enhances the consumer experience.
Now moving to Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. During the seasonally largest quarter of the year, the team continued to do a great job, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry. Four of our 5 European rental businesses had increases in transaction volume without significant discounting. This speaks to our leadership in the industry and our ability to grow transactions. 
Here's how our service rental model works. All of our properties are backed by the Wyndham service commitment, giving both owners and consumers peace of mind in their rental experience. We provide our owners and guests with a high level of service, from marketing to managing their calendar, handling the booking and payment process, providing check-in and checkout services and maintaining quality standards through property inspections. 
This is very different from the listings model, which typically provides only online marketing, leaving it to the owner to field inquiries from prospective guests; update and maintain their availability calendars; provide key holding, check-in and checkout services to guests; address service and property issues for guests during their stay; and ultimately, handle the collection process. We have over 40 years’ experience in vacation rental and follow a disciplined approach to developing new markets.
The development model in Europe was designed to minimize risk in the early stages and maximize profit once the market is ready. Initially, we analyze the market and establish a network with local tourist organizations to help develop demand. We then test our brand in the market on a small scale. We begin property recruitment efforts through partnership with third parties in the market, such as travel agents, with minimal internal cost and risk. Once critical mass has been reached, we will make a full-scale entry to realize the potential of the market.
This is a tested and proven approach, and Croatia is a great example. We entered Croatia in 2004 and sold less than 200 weeks. In 2012, we're the market leader, and we have already sold over 30,000 weeks through September. The key to our strategy in Europe and in the U.S. is applying best practices across our businesses and leveraging our core competencies in marketing and analytics.
We also supplement growth through M&A. For example, in August, we continue to expand our vacation rental business in the United States with the acquisition of a leading vacation rental company located at the main entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. This is America's busiest national park, attracting over 9 million visitors each year. We think the acquisition is a great addition to our portfolio.
Moving to the Exchange business. We've just completed the latest release of rci.com, which delivered several new advancements, including web enablement of our points exchange transactions on mobile devices, the ability of -- to cross-sell products using predictive modeling to provide offers uniquely tailored to our members’ needs and wants and the introduction of the first fully transactional and translated Chinese website in the global vacation exchange industry. This is the final major release of our successful 4-year rci.com mission, which has greatly enhanced the value we bring to our members, as well as our efficiency.
rci.com has launched several industry firsts, including RCI TV, enhanced search, RCI Platinum, trading power transparency, combining deposits and change back. We are on track to reduce call volume by over 30% from the inception of the project through year-end 2012, and we expect a total reduction of almost 40% by 2015. We've driven online web share from 13% to currently over 40%, and it's still climbing. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a busy and productive quarter. In September, we acquired Shell Vacations, which brought us approximately 115,000 owners and 19 managed resorts in North America. WVO will now operate Shell Vacation Club, a leading points-based club system, featuring a wide variety of member benefits and travel options. 
As Tom will discuss, this tuck-in acquisition has a healthy rate of return, is immediately accretive to earnings and will generate meaningful cash flow. With strong fee-for-service revenues, the acquisition was consistent with our capital-light strategy. We look forward to building upon Shell's many achievements and continuing the growth of its highly successful vacation club by providing outstanding quality, value and customer care.
The timeshare business is attractive because it is a business that has great returns, high customer satisfaction and a great future. Interestingly, the demographic is broadening. Recent buyers are younger, and the ownership base has shifted slightly in terms of marital status with a lower percentage of married owners and a higher percentage of singles. 
According to ARDA's recently released biannual consumer survey, the typical timeshare owner today has medium household income of $74,000. 89% own their primary residence. 64% do not have children at home, and 58% are college graduates with over 1/3 of those owners have graduate degrees. The ARDA results also show that 83% of timeshare owners say their experience is good to excellent.
Timeshare owners love the product for a variety of reasons, including resort locations; saving money on future vacations; the overall flexibility of the product, including the opportunity to exchange; and the discipline of taking vacations every year. Clearly, timeshare offers an attractive value proposition for consumers. This bodes well for our own timeshare business and also for RCI.
Finally, as you saw from the press release, we have given you the first view of our 2013 outlook. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth is consistent with our long-term strategy. Our investor theme has been, “Excellent execution and powerful cash flow drive dependable growth.” Two years ago, we laid out a plan that resulted in EPS growth of 17% to 20% over the following 5 years with the proper allocation of our strong and sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We are well on our way to achieving that plan and much more. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
31063165,222400075,368999,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2012",2012-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

These results reflect the sound strategies that we continue to adv",1676,"Thanks, Steve. Overall, our third quarter results were solid with adjusted earnings per share coming in 20% above the same period in 2011 and $0.03 above the top end of our guidance range. These results reflect the sound strategies that we continue to advance and refine over time, strong operational execution in all of our businesses and the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.
Through the first 9 months of 2012, we generated $682 million or $4.61 per share of free cash flow compared with $636 million or $3.74 per share during the same period in 2011. Now, that excludes the impact of a $67 million benefit from a VAT refund and related interest income received late last year. We used the majority of our year-to-date cash flow to repurchase shares. We repurchased $133 million in the third quarter for a 9-month total repurchase of $473 million, plus an additional $49 million in October.
As Steve mentioned and consistent with our capital allocation strategy, on September 13, we acquired Shell Vacation ownership club and property management group. The purchase price was $96 million net of cash, plus $157 million of debt primarily related to consumer loan receivables. This tuck-in acquisition will increase our vacation ownership fee-for-service property management EBITDA by approximately 10%. 
From an earnings perspective, the deal will be minimally accretive on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to add a few pennies to our 2013 EPS. On the balance sheet, you'll see an increase of approximately $126 million in consumer finance receivables and an increase in inventory of about $41 million related to the acquisition. We expect after-tax unlevered returns of close to 20%, which, of course, is above our hurdle rate.
As you saw from the press release and as Steve mentioned, currency had a significant effect on the results in the third quarter. When we evaluate business unit performance, we look at the results in local currency and exclude the impact of foreign exchange. In accordance with GAAP, our reported numbers include this effect, so where meaningful, I shall highlight results in constant currency.
At Wyndham Hotel Group, revenues were up 12%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 28% compared with the third quarter of 2011, attributable to domestic RevPAR gains, our Wyndham Grand Hotel in Orlando and higher intersegment fees. Excluding the higher intersegment fees, adjusted EBITDA increased by 21%. Domestic RevPAR improved by 5% in the third quarter, driven equally by increases in the average daily rate and occupancy. Systemwide RevPar increased 2% with a 5% decline in international RevPAR offsetting the stronger domestic results. In constant currency, systemwide RevPAR is up 3%.
Now the decline in the international RevPAR reflects a mix effect, driven by the growth in Asia, our lowest RevPAR region. Over the past year, we have increased the number of hotels in our Asia-Pacific region by 26%. This rapid growth has a dilutive impact on systemwide RevPAR due to Asia Pacific's relatively low RevPAR compared to North America and other international regions. Compounding the effect, our lower RevPAR brands, specifically Super 8, are growing more rapidly than our higher RevPAR brands in China. This creates an interesting dynamic where system growth can reduce RevPAR while increasing earnings. 
To further the point, on a reported basis, RevPAR in Asia Pacific was down 9%. However, same-store RevPAR was up 1%. Excluding the mix effect, same-store international RevPAR was up by 2% in constant currency. System size was up 1% year-over-year with net openings of 11,500 rooms, partially driven by multiunit deals, such as the recent Hospitality Properties Trust transaction, which consisted of 20 properties and 3,000 rooms throughout the United States. 
As Steve mentioned earlier, emerging markets, such as Brazil and China, are driving international room growth, which now accounts for nearly 28% of the portfolio, compared with 26% during the same period in 2011. Overall, pipeline activity is down 5%, both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily related to the openings in our Asia-Pacific region. Our overall development efforts remain on track. 
Now let's look at Wyndham Exchange and Rentals. As Steve said, despite the challenges in Europe and limited growth in the broader timeshare industry, the business had another solid quarter. Excluding the effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were flat compared to the same period in 2011. In constant currency, third quarter vacation exchange revenues were flat. The average number of members declined 2%, reflecting the nonrenewal of an affiliation agreement at the beginning of 2012, while exchange revenue per member increased by 1% compared with the same period last year. 
Looking at rentals. Excluding the net effect of foreign currency and acquisitions, third quarter 2012 revenues compared with the same period in 2011 were flat. Transaction volumes were up 3%, primarily driven by better penetration in recently developed Novasol markets and improved results in our Hoseasons Group business despite continued softness in the U.K. market. These gains were offset by a 2% decline in the average net price per vacation rental, reflecting a mix shift to lower-priced markets.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. This business delivered another strong quarter. Compared to the prior year, revenues increased by $49 million or 9%, primarily due to positive VOI results. Year-over-year, gross VOI increased by $47 million or 10%. The improvement reflects a 5% increase in both VPG and tour flow. The VPG increase was attributable to both higher pricing due to better yield management and improved close rates, resulting in part from our credit prescreening program. Tour flow reflects a focus on marketing programs directed to new owner generation. Year-to-date, we have brought almost 22,000 new owners into the system, an increase of 5% over the same period in 2011, and we are on track for our annual goal of 27,000 new owners. 
Total gross VOI sales from WAAM increased to $62 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the prior year, a 63% increase. This growth reflects sales of the second phase of one of our initial WAAM projects near Orlando. The first phase, launched 2 years ago, was the WAAM 1.0. This new phase is WAAM 2.0. We believe this demonstrates both the success of our overall WAAM program and developers' interest in various WAAM models. 
Consumer finance revenue was flat versus the same period last year. Write-offs during the third quarter improved somewhat to $71 million, down from $73 million in the prior year. The provision for loan loss was $124 million compared with $96 million in the third quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting higher sales and challenges in portfolio performance, which we discussed with you last quarter. These challenges reflect higher default levels due to larger loan balances and some third-party fraud affecting loan defaults. Remediation plans are in place, and we are monitoring the situation closely. We expect the provision to moderate going forward, and we will keep you updated on our progress.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $155 million, up 4% compared with the third quarter of 2011. The increase primarily reflects the revenue increases, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses related to the increase in VOI sales and higher intersegment licensing fees for use of the Wyndham brand trade name. Now excluding these higher fees, adjusted EBITDA for WVO was up 7%.
Now on a corporate financing front, we recently launched a new commercial paper program. This program, which is already in use, allows us to borrow short-term funds at even lower rates than our revolving credit facility. Overall debt levels will be unaffected by this facility. 
As Steve noted, our long-term corporate goals remain unchanged. We are targeting annual EBITDA growth of 6% to 8%, high-single to low-double digit growth in our Hotel group and mid-single digit growth in the Exchange and Rentals group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. We expect sustainable annual free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million. We will continue to manage our balance sheet metrics consistent with an investment grade profile, which enable us to increase debt by $300 million for every $100 million that we add in EBITDA. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. As you saw from the press release, we are narrowing our full year revenue guidance range to $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion and our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1,045,000,000 to $1,055,000,000. 
We are also narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.20 per share. The new EPS guidance is based on an expected diluted share count of 146 million shares, down from our most recent guidance of 147 million shares. This new guidance reflects the benefit of our share repurchase program through the third quarter and excludes any further share repurchases. We currently have approximately $608 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Now let's touch on a few modifications regarding final 2012 driver guidance. For the full year, we expect RevPAR to come in at the lower end of our guidance range, while tours and VPG will come in at the upper end of our guidance ranges. 
Our 2013 outlook reflects continued momentum in the businesses. We expect revenues of $4.9 billion to $5,050,000,000; EBITDA of $1,125,000,000 to $1,150,000,000; and adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.60 a share, assuming a diluted share count of 143 million shares. 
The share count assumption includes our share repurchase through September 30, 2012. Also assume that our 2013 EPS guidance's higher depreciation and amortization expense based on the Shell acquisition, as well as a some capital projects and IT initiatives being put into service. We'll give you, of course, full guidance on our February call. Finally, we expect free cash flow of between $600 million and $700 million in 2013 and available cash of close to $1 billion. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve."

And our team in Las Vegas and -- our teams in Las Vegas and Orlando have worked on tightening up some of the underwriting standards on how we lend out money and to whom we'll lend money. So we hope that the tightening of those underwriting standards will help us to both retain momentum in VPG, while dealing with some of the large balance loan situation. As it relates to the second factor, which is this organized fraud activity, we had started some months ago to pursue very aggressive legal tactics with some of these third parties. We feel like it's a bit like a whack-a-mole situation. But we think that we've addressed some of the major sources of this fraud activity in a pretty significant way. So we expect to see improvement in that area, probably more rapidly. Within the next few months, we expect to see some improvement."

When we sell a WAAM 2.0 ownership right, we will almost simultaneously pay for the inventory and provide the inventory to the buyer. So it's a much more efficient cash flow model. Some of the optics on balance sheet -- and we'll start to get into it more as it becomes a bigger part of our business -- will be a bit different. The revenue classification will be gross VOI. It won't be commissions. So you'll see the commission line on our financial statements start to wane a bit. But from a margin perspective, it's going to be improved, of course. The interest income that we get on WAAM 2.0 is a whole different business category, so the margin that we -- the VOI margin that we get will be comparable, but the interest income, of course, will add incremental EBITDA that we wouldn’t have received had be only been a WAAM 1.0 participant."

The third quarter is obviously a huge quarter for us because it's the big leisure travel quarter.

Less strong was in the -- on the East Coast and towards the Northeast. So I think there were maybe shifts in some leisure travel during the quarter versus the quarter last year. But it wasn't massive, and it was very hard to tell what is specifically related to our Apollo initiatives. We know that we saw increases of the bookings through our websites. That definitely has picked up. But we don't know how many of those we would've gotten on the call center. We don't know how many of those would have been drive up, so it’s a little bit difficult to tell with specificity. But I think the biggest barometer is what we hear from our franchisees. And we just had Howard Johnson franchisees in here yesterday, and there was good enthusiasm with the group. So I think they're seeing the results of some of these initiatives we're putting out. The TripAdvisor on our websites, as well as the various initiatives we've taken with Apollo."

Occupancy, ADR, that’s all in the tables to the earnings. But I think they're relatively equal.

So it wasn’t like we were up 25% somewhere. There were just some areas that were stronger, and that may reflect, frankly, weakness in 2011 that now is recovering and showing better in 2012. I think in the Pacific Northwest, that is one of the factors influencing it was that was weakened in 2011. So I don't think there's -- I mean, I'm trying to give you a little bit of that color, but I don't think there's a lot more that would be insightful for you.

I mean, mobile is becoming a bigger and bigger portion of the booking machine. And what we did was -- what I spoke about was we added a click-to-chat feature, an easier-to-use click-to-chat feature, it was always kind of there, but it was clunky, to our mobile sites. What we're trying to encourage people to do is we're making it easier for them to contact us and book their room. If you go to our mobile sites right now, Super 8, Days Inn, whatever you might want to look at, there's a very easy express check-in button on the site where you can book based on the location you're at right now. It'll bring up the closest properties, and you can book it with basically one click and let people know that you're coming. So we're just trying to make it easier. Our travelers are largely car-bound travelers domestically, and we just want to make it as easy as possible. So when you pull over to the side of the road to look at your mobile phone and book your reservation, that it’s as easy as possible and you can get back on the road."

But the -- I would be willing to bet $1 that it's a younger demographic that's on the mobile phones than is on the reservations line. And we know that, I guess, another factor is that, I think I said this last quarter, that like 2 -- almost 2/3 of the bookings that we do are done on the day of arrival, and many of it is done within 5 miles of the hotel. So that's for the mobile bookings. So the mobile is the most immediate type of booking rather than just driving up to the hotel. So the immediacy is there, and my guess is it's probably a younger demo than you'd see in the normal either online or reservations booking.
And thanks, all of you, for spending time with us. We appreciate the opportunity to share the results and look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter. Thank you."
