Late yesterday, we announced record setting net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter of a dollar per share reflecting a 69% improvement over the $0.59 per share reported for the 2010 fourth quarter. For the year, we announced record earnings of $3.33 per share, a 55% increase compared to $2.15 per share for 2010. Our record fourth quarter and year earnings were the result of strong demand for inland tank barge service, modest earnings contribution from our coastal marine tank barge business, strong earnings from our land-based diesel engine service business and improved earnings from our heritage marine diesel engine service business.

I will speak briefly about K-Sea’s results, our coastal tank barge operation. And I am going to turn the call over to Greg Binion who will update you on our inland marine transportation and diesel engine service markets.

With respect to K-Sea, K-Sea’s operating results were as expected for both fourth quarter and the year. Fourth quarter is generally a more difficult quarter for coastal business due to some seasonality in the cargos, we carry principally the refined products and either the closure or a reduction in demand in Alaska and on the Great Lakes, as poor weather conditions affect those operations.

In addition, the fourth quarter included a $1,250,000 severance charge associated with integrating K-Sea’s back office into Kirby’s.

For the fourth quarter, K-Sea’s equipment utilization was approximately 75% to 80% with respect to pricing. Contracts in this market that renewed during the fourth quarter were basically flat and spot contracts improved in the low-to-mid single digit range year-over-year.

During the fourth quarter, approximately 60% of K-Sea’s revenues were under term contract and 40% were in the spot market.

Time charters in this coastal business represent approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts for the quarter. With refined product demand tying K-Sea more to the US economy than our inland operation, K-Sea’s equipment utilization levels and pricing environment remains below our inland transportation business.

As we continue to fine tune K-Sea’s cost structure, the US economy improves and industry capacity is removed from service, coastwise utilization rates should improve as well as K-Sea’s profitability. I will come back at the end of this call and talk about the full and first quarter outlook for 2012 and let me turn the call now over to Greg.

During the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector continued its strong performance with utilization rates and favorable pricing trends. Low price natural gas continue to positively impact the global",2023,"Thank you, Joe and good morning to all. During the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector continued its strong performance with utilization rates and favorable pricing trends. Low price natural gas continue to positively impact the global competitiveness of the US petrochemical industry. The feedstock advantage provided continued strong volumes of domestically produced petrochemicals for domestic consumption and exportation.

Kirby’s black oil fleet continues to see strong demand driven by stable refinery output and the movement of crude from the Midwest of the Gulf Coast and also out of South Texas. Our refined products demand remain positive benefitting from the Midwest to Gulf Coast movements of ethanol and our agricultural demand was also brisk benefitting both from domestic lead produced and imported ag products. Consequently during the 2011 fourth quarter Kirby’s petrochemical and black oil inland fleets achieved utilization rates in the low to mid 90% range.

Revenue from our long-term contracts that is one year in duration or longer remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and our freight business continued at about 55% and 45% respectively 

Turning now to inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts which renewed during the fourth quarter achieved rate increases in the mid single-digit range when compared with the 2010 fourth quarter. Spot contract pricing which includes the price of fuel saw rate increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared with the 2011 third quarter. Our multi-year contracts have annual escalations based on labor and producer price index. Some of these are adjusted each January and the adjustment effective on January 1, 2012 provided rate increases in the 2% range.

During 2011, we continue to invest in our inland fleet, both in terms of the new construction and upgrading existing barges. This reduces maintenance cost in out-of-service days and improves the reliability of our fleet and our service to our customers. If we roll forward to the end of 2012 and exclude our non-certificated fleet which moves primarily fertilizer solutions, our average inland tank barge fleet age will be about 16.5 years old.

During 2011, we took delivery of 30,000 barrel tank barges and two new pressure barges totaling approximately 1.1 million barrels of capacity. During 2011, we retired 66 tank barges totaling 1.25 million barrels of capacity. We also added 20 tank barges with the purchase of the ship bunkering operation of Enterprise in February of 2011 adding approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity. So net net, during 2011 our active inland tank barge fleet capacity increased by about 250,000 barrels.

As of December 31, 2011 we operated 819 tank barges with a capacity of 16.2 million barrels. We also took delivery of one 2000 horsepower inland towboat in the 2011 fourth quarter.For 2012 our construction program will consist of 25,000 to 30,000 barrels inland tank barges and 30 new 10,000 barrels inland tank barges with the total capacity of approximately one million barrels. We are also building five canal towboats for 2012 delivery. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats is approximately $100 million, the majority of which will be expended in 2012. We will also continue to retire our older inland tank barges during 2012.In the 2012 fourth quarter, we also expect to take delivery of two new offshore articulated, dry cargo barges and tug units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million. During 2011 we did make progress payments on these two units totaling $33 million and the balance will be paid in 2012.For 2011 we estimate the industry placed into service approximately 160 inland tank barges, 40 of which were Kirbys. We estimate that a 100 to 125 were retired from service, the majority of which were 35 years or older. Due to improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil products barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment, we estimate that approximately 235 inland tank barges were on order industry-wide for delivery throughout 2012, 55 of these are Kirbys. Short to medium term we don't see this as a problem for the industry as we believe that increased market volumes and fleet retirements will keep supply and demand in relative balance.

Turning now to our diesel engine services segment; our April 15 acquisition of United had a positive impact on Kirby’s fourth quarter and the full year financial results. United contributed approximately 75% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue for the fourth quarter. United's operating margin was in the low double-digit range.With continued exploration and development of the nation’s shale formations, United’s revenue and operating margins were better than expected. Manufacturing and servicing of hydraulic fracturing equipment and the sale of land base transmissions and diesel engines remains robust.Finally our legacy diesel engine services segment, which evolves in green market also improved, as well as our power generation market with engine generator set upgrades, parts and services all being stable. The Gulf Coast oil service market was similar to the third quarter with lower than historical levels of drilling rigs working in the gulf in the resulting competitive environment for service work.I will now turn this call over to David.David Grzebinski</TAG>

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, I will talk about margin and then provide a few more other financial details. Continued strong performance in our inland transportation sector and the purchase of K-Sea effective July 1st resulted in Kirby’s margin transportation revenues being 44% above and operating income 48% above the 2010 fourth quarter.The marine segments operating margin was 21.8% compared with 21.2% for the 2010 fourth quarter. Without the severance charge at K-Sea, operating margins would have been 22.2% for the fourth quarter.As Greg noted, during the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector had continued high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range, with some softness in November, but a fairly strong rebound in December. So our legacy marine transportation sector maintained its strong operating margins in the mid-20% range during the fourth quarter.K-Sea, which contributed approximately 20% of fourth quarter’s marine transportation segment’s revenues, they contributed to our fourth quarter operating income with margins in the low single-digit range.With the acquisition of United, our diesel engine services revenues increased to $215 million in the quarter from $54 million a year-ago and operating income was $23 million compared with $7 million for last year’s fourth quarter. The segment operating margins were 10.6% compared with 12.8% for the 2010 fourth quarter. However, without the earn-out adjustment, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute, operating margins would have been approximately 12%.United’s strong performance continued in both the service and manufacturing sectors and their operating margins were in the low double-digits, which is higher than historically United operating margins and this is driven by higher volume leverage, which basically flowed through to the bottom-line.On the cash flow side, we continue to generate significant cash during 2011. Our EBITDA was 436 million for the year. Our capital spending for 2011 was $226 million and consisted of $115 million for new inland tank barges and tow boats, $33 million in progress payments for the two new offshore dry-bulk barge and tug units that Greg mentioned and then $78 million primarily for capital upgrades to existing inland and coast-wise equipment. Capital expenditures for K-Sea and the United were minimal.Our capital spending guidance for 2012 is currently in the range of $255 million to $265 million and that includes approximately $100 million for the construction of new equipment and approximately $70 million in progress payments of the two dry-bulk units that Greg noted. The balance is for upgrades to existing marine equipment and some small spending in the diesel engine services facilities area.As of December 31st we had $95 million outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility, which included the $42.7 million acquisition of the Seaboats fleet that we completed in late fourth quarter. This morning our revolver's outstanding balance was $73 million.Now, I would like to talk about the earn-out. As you know, we have this earn-out in place as part of our acquisition of the United Holdings. The former owners received $270 million on closing, but can receive an additional $15 million payable in 2014 if certain financial targets are met during 2011, 2012 and 2013. A fair value estimate of the amount we think we will have to pay under this arrangement is determined each quarter and held as a contingent liability on our balance sheet. Any changes to the estimate we believe we will pay runs through the income statements. If we increased our estimate of the payout we would increase the contingent liability and it would lower our earnings.Conversely, if lower the estimate we would reduces the liability, thereby increasing our earnings. During the fourth quarter we booked $3.7 million or $0.04 per share in expense as our estimate if the amount we would have to pay increased. For the year 2011 we booked a total of $6.3 million or $0.07 per share in expenses. As there are two full years remaining for the earn-out period you can understand that we maybe required to make further adjustment either up or down to this contingent liability. We have consequently excluded any potential changes to the earn-out contingent liability from our guidance.Joe will share our outlook and guidance shortly. I will now turn the call back to Joe.Joe PyneThank you, David. There is certainly still some uncertainty in the US and world economies and this uncertainty is reflected somewhat in our 2004 guidance. Our 2012 year guidance range is $3.85 to $4.05 per share. This compares with the $3.33 per share, which we just reported for the 2011 year. Our 2012 low end guidance of $3.85 assumes that our inland and costal marine transportation equipment utilization and pricing will consistent with the 2011 second half and that our diesel engine service land based market will not be as strong as it was in 2011 with some second half softness in the manufacturing of principally hydraulic fracking units.

The high-end guidance of $4.05 per share assumes both marine transportation markets will improve modestly with corresponding higher term and spot contract pricing. On the diesel engine service side, our high end guidance assumes that our land-based market will be similar to what it was in 2011 with continued strong manufacturing and remanufacturing of hydraulic fracking equipment, as well as some modest improvement in our marine power generation and Gulf Coast oil service markets.

There has been much market discussion about the rapid expansion of fracking units in the oil and gas business and the effect of the natural gas prices on the need for drilling and fracturing equipment. We have had no customer cancelations and our 2012 backlog is about the same as it was this time last year.

Moving to the first quarter guidance of $0.86 to $0.93 per share; in our marine transportation segment we are forecasting that both our inland and coast-wise overall equipment utilization levels and pricing will remain relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. Weather issues and lock delays will impact the first quarter.

During January, we experienced of course some of these delays. The first quarter will also be negatively affected by a major maintenance issue with one of the key locks on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway which causes the lock to be deactivated for short periods of time.

In summary, 2011 was a terrific year for Kirby with record revenues, earnings and cash flow and of course we recorded the record results. Significant acquisitions completed in 2011 were positive in the marine transportation and diesel engine areas and the markets are complimentary to our legacy market and we believe position us well for continued growth.

Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow is excellent. Our two businesses which are in more challenging markets are coastal business and our legacy diesel engine business should improve as capacity tightens and volumes expand with respect to the coastal trade and drilling activity increases in the Gulf of Mexico with respect to our legacy diesel engine business.

Operator, that’s all of our prepared remarks. We’re now ready to take questions.

And then when you read your commentary about the assumptions in the high and the low end of your range, that would seem to match up with the higher end of the range.

So my question is the ordering for the fracking equipment, how did that progressed through the fourth quarter from beginning to end and so far earlier this year and do you feel that maybe your customers are a little bit more reluctant to order than six months ago as pressure pumping margins may have decreased?

You know, the order pattern tends to be back-end loaded in the year. So you know, you work on your backlog through the first two quarters and then you build the back-up in the last two quarters. So far, as Joe indicated, the backlog’s approximately where it was at the beginning of last year. What we don’t know is what the strength of the year will be going forward, obviously, the low natural gas prices is impacting gas directed fracturing, but a lot of our customers are moving their equipment to more oil directed as you would expect; we’re just a little cautious on how that might play out through the remainder of the year.

We talk a lot about United and pressure pumping, but really one of the big for us that United has had over the last year or so is to be able to diversify its product offering and we are now at a point where really we would extend that product offering so we can provide all the equipment needed by frac operation. So of course pressure pumps, so we also offer blenders, cementers, hydration units and transfer pumps and recently added the capability to provide our customers with the data van.

So, and one of the things that we’ve seen is interest in addition to what Dave has talked about an interest in the pressure pumping equipment; we’ve also seen some expanded interest in these other non-pressure pumping products. So we are excited about the diversification and the capability to provide our customers with a complete suite of frac equipment.

The other thing that we’ve been working on is the thing that really brought us to United in the first place and that is centered around the service component of the business as it relates to remanufacturing ability; you think about the frac market there is somewhere in the 7,000 frac pumps that are out there operating in very harsh conditions everyday. And so we’ve been trying to position ourselves as one of the premier remanufacturers of this equipment as you can remanufacture and make like new a frac pump for roughly 60% to 70% of the cost of new.

As we go into 2012 this interest in remanufacturing is really strengthening as our customers, the operators of these fleets have been able to grow their fleet size to the point where they can take some capacity out and afford to have it offline and do this process which you know takes several weeks. And also they have established their capital budgets to accommodate this remanufacturing of frac fleets.

We did a small number of test units last year which were successful and we’ve got a more of that program as we go into 2012. And we have in place the marketing effort, the process for accomplishing this efficiently, the supply chain in place and then the people with the skill-sets required to deliver to our customers.

And to that finally I would say that the facility that we have where we really focus our manufacturing is flexible and allows us to do a mix of both new and remanufacturing pressure pumping units and also to build these non-pressure pumping also related products.

However we think there will be some continued movement of crude oil by barge as barges are much more flexible and as we feel to develop, they do have different types of crude oil that are produced and so as a result of that, you need flexibility to move those different types of crudes to the refineries that can run them most efficiently.

When we announced the acquisition, we said that we would save in 2011 on an annualized basis, about $7 million and that would add to the earnings of K-Sea. As we move through it and you heard some of the severance charges that we outlined this quarter. We think the annualized savings going forward is about on the order of $10 million, which is probably a little better than we expected in terms of earnings contribution from K-Sea. I think what we need to watch here is how the market develops, the US economy is still fairly weak and refined products demand is still weak and we’ve got to see that come back before we get significant accretion, but it will be a positive contributor to our earnings in 2012 this year.

So, I guess, the main part of my question here is, when you think about the rationality of natural gas prices over the next 12 to 18 months and maybe moving back higher if we see production come in, at what point, do you think domestically our petrochemical producers begin to lose their feedstock advantage and you see some pullback in [group] capacity expansion.

Jack and another component to that is probably even more important than the actual price of natural gas is the differential between crude oil and natural gas and historically it was between six and seven times. So you can multiply 250 times 7 and you can see the crude oil would be very, very low for petrochemical manufacturing complexes around the world, but a large number of them were based on liquid feedstock slates where the US manufacturing capacity was really based on cheap natural gas and people worried about that when gas back in the early 2000s spiked upto to high single digits, low double-digit numbers and it’s really apparent that that we have got plenty of gas and that that is not going to happen for a while. And it also doesn’t look like crude oil is going to come down in value to the point where it goes back to its historical relationship. So we are not really worried about that and I think that based on that, you are beginning to see chemical companies talk about investments in North America and there’s been lots of noise and they have been already decisions to add additional capacity.

Clearly we are getting volume leverage. We haven't taken costs out of United and in fact they've been expanding because they've ramping up their capacity. So what we've really seeing is just that fixed cost spread as the volume of both manufactured equipment and service-related items and parts goes through the organization and more of it is just falling to the bottom line because the G&A cost aren’t going up in line with that as they exercise the leverage.Now I guess the second part of the question was, will margins drop, go back to a more normal range and I would say that it’s depended on the volume. It will scale up and down with volume. Clearly if volume comes down we will address the cost structure but right now things are pretty much right-sized for where we are in.

But there are some that are pretty close, that are smaller bolt-on that are very likely to occur. Also, there is the interesting news recently, where a methanol producer has decided to move some assets that are down in Chile to the Geismar area for activation in the US market and participation in the low-cost natural gas.

And then there has been some restarts of some places that have been idle and thought might never come back online, but they have around methanol and the production also of ammonia. So there is a - and then I guess and end up with, there has also been some interest in gas-to-liquids projects. There is two that are currently being studied for the Gulf Coast at this point in time as well.

And then, on the refining side, there has also been some in defense line addition capacity adds along the Gulf Coast to take advantage of all the infrastructure that’s available here and the refinery interplay that occurs as people trade and move intermediates between refineries to optimize the refinery runs. So there is a lot of activity on the Gulf Coast and we think it’s all beneficial for us long-term.

But there is other things that we can help K-Sea do. You know, Kirby is the largest mover of chemicals in the waterway system. There are chemicals that move offshore and we think that through our relationships with these major chemical manufacturers that we can put them in position to move chemicals which is going to help them. But also believe that the combined Kirby with K-Sea, is even bigger piece of the market and the relationships that we have with those existing customers can be levered to position K-Sea for potentially more cargos than they could buy themselves. So I think all of that is going to be positive-ish and going to take a little while the work is way through.

And you still have unemployment that is, I guess, this morning it was 8.3% after adding 250,000 jobs and after 1.2 million people dropped out of the work force. That’s pretty negative. The GDP was a little better in the fourth quarter, but it’s expected to moderate. That’s the kind of thing that we’re talking about when I talked about the outlook. There is still a lot of uncertainty out there. But, even with all of that, I don’t think that we’re concerned in that legacy marine business that it’s in trouble at all. I think, that we stayed pretty busy throughout the quarter. Some slight weakness maybe in November, but it came back strong in December. Low inventory levels, not restocking is positive for us and it actually creates more consistent demand when you stock up it, it creates some short-term demand, which I think collapsed, so we’re not sure that the environment that you just described is negative at all as we kind of understand our business and how it services those customers.

Late yesterday, we announced record setting net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter of a dollar per share reflecting a 69% improvement over the $0.59 per share reported for the 2010 fourth quarter. For the year, we announced record earnings of $3.33 per share, a 55% increase compared to $2.15 per share for 2010. Our record fourth quarter and year earnings were the result of strong demand for inland tank barge service, modest earnings contribution from our coastal marine tank barge business, strong earnings from our land-based diesel engine service business and improved earnings from our heritage marine diesel engine service business.
I will speak briefly about K-Sea’s results, our coastal tank barge operation. And I am going to turn the call over to Greg Binion who will update you on our inland marine transportation and diesel engine service markets.
With respect to K-Sea, K-Sea’s operating results were as expected for both fourth quarter and the year. Fourth quarter is generally a more difficult quarter for coastal business due to some seasonality in the cargos, we carry, principally the refined products and either the closure or a reduction in demand in Alaska and on the Great Lakes, as poor weather conditions affect those operations.
In addition, the fourth quarter included a $1,250,000 severance charge associated with integrating K-Sea’s back office into Kirby’s.
For the fourth quarter, K-Sea’s equipment utilization was approximately 75% to 80% with respect to pricing. Contracts in this market that renewed during the fourth quarter were basically flat and spot contracts improved in the low-to-mid single digit range year-over-year.
During the fourth quarter, approximately 60% of K-Sea’s revenues were under term contract and 40% were in the spot market.
Time charters in this coastal business represent approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts for the quarter. With refined product demand tying K-Sea more to the US economy than our inland operation, K-Sea’s equipment utilization levels and pricing environment remains below our inland transportation business.
As we continue to fine tune K-Sea’s cost structure, the US economy improves and industry capacity is removed from service, coastwise utilization rates should improve as well as K-Sea’s profitability. I will come back at the end of this call and talk about the full year and first quarter outlook for 2012 and let me turn the call now over to Greg."

During the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector continued its strong performance with high utilization rates and favorable pricing trends. Low price natural gas continued to positively impact the global competitiveness of the US petrochemical industry. The feedstock advantage provided continued strong volumes of domestically produced petrochemicals for domestic consumption and exportation.
Kirby’s black oil fleet continues to see strong demand driven by stable refinery output and the movement of crude from the Midwest of the Gulf Coast and also out of South Texas. Our refined products demand remain positive benefitting from the Midwest to Gulf Coast movements of ethanol and our agricultural demand was also brisk benefitting both from domestic lead produced and imported ag products. Consequently during the 2011 fourth quarter Kirby’s petrochemical and black oil inland fleets achieved utilization rates in the low to mid 90% range.
Revenue from our long-term contracts that is one year in duration or longer remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and our freight business continued at about 55% and 45% respectively 
Turning now to inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts which renewed during the fourth quarter achieved rate increases in the mid single-digit range when compared with the 2010 fourth quarter. Spot contract pricing which includes the price of fuel saw rate increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared with the 2011 third quarter. Our multi-year contracts have annual escalations based on labor and producer price index. Some of these are adjusted each January and the adjustment effective on January 1, 2012 provided rate increases in the 2% range.
During 2011, we continue to invest in our inland fleet, both in terms of the new construction and upgrading existing barges. This reduces maintenance cost and out-of-service days and improves the reliability of our fleet and our service to our customers. If we roll forward to the end of 2012 and exclude our non-certificated fleet which moves primarily fertilizer solutions, our average inland tank barge fleet age will be about 16.5 years old.
During 2011, we took delivery of 38 new 30,000 barrel tank barges and two new pressure barges totaling approximately 1.1 million barrels of capacity. During 2011, we retired 66 tank barges totaling 1.25 million barrels of capacity. We also added 20 tank barges with the purchase of the ship bunkering operation of Enterprise in February of 2011 adding approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity. So net net, during 2011 our active inland tank barge fleet capacity increased by about 250,000 barrels.
As of December 31, 2011 we operated 819 tank barges with a capacity of 16.2 million barrels. We also took delivery of one 2000 horsepower inland towboat in the 2011 fourth quarter. For 2012 our construction program will consist of 25, 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 30 new 10,000 barrels inland tank barges with the total capacity of approximately one million barrels. We are also building five canal towboats for 2012 delivery. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats is approximately $100 million, the majority of which will be expended in 2012. We will also continue to retire our older inland tank barges during 2012. In the 2012 fourth quarter, we also expect to take delivery of two new offshore articulated, dry cargo barge and tug units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million. During 2011 we did make progress payments on these two units totaling $33 million and the balance will be paid in 2012. For 2011 we estimate the industry placed into service approximately 160 inland tank barges, 40 of which were Kirbys. We estimate that a 100 to 125 were retired from service, the majority of which were 35 years or older. Due to improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil products barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment, we estimate that approximately 235 inland tank barges were on order industry-wide for delivery throughout 2012, 55 of these are Kirbys. Short to medium term we don't see this as a problem for the industry as we believe that increased market volumes and fleet retirements will keep supply and demand in relative balance.
Turning now to our diesel engine services segment; our April 15 acquisition of United had a positive impact on Kirby’s fourth quarter and the full year financial results. United contributed approximately 75% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue for the fourth quarter. United's operating margin was in the low double-digit range. With continued exploration and development of the nation’s shale formations, United’s revenue and operating margins were better than expected. Manufacturing and servicing of hydraulic fracturing equipment and the sale of land base transmissions and diesel engines remains robust. Finally our legacy diesel engine services segment, which involves the marine market also improved, as well as our power generation market with engine generator set upgrades, parts and services all being stable. The Gulf Coast oil service market was similar to the third quarter with lower than historical levels of drilling rigs working in the gulf in the resulting competitive environment for service work. I will now turn this call over to David."

Good morning, I will talk about margins and then provide a few more other financial details. Continued strong performance in our inland transportation sector and the purchase of K-Sea effective July 1st resulted in Kirby’s marine transportation revenues being 44% above and operating income 48% above the 2010 fourth quarter. The marine segments operating margin was 21.8% compared with 21.2% for the 2010 fourth quarter. Without the severance charge at K-Sea, operating margins would have been 22.2% for the fourth quarter. As Greg noted, during the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector had continued high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range, with some softness in November, but a fairly strong rebound in December. So our legacy marine transportation sector maintained its strong operating margins in the mid-20% range during the fourth quarter. K-Sea, which contributed approximately 20% of fourth quarter’s marine transportation segment’s revenues, they contributed to our fourth quarter operating income with margins in the low single-digit range. With the acquisition of United, our diesel engine services revenues increased to $215 million in the quarter from $54 million a year-ago and operating income was $23 million compared with $7 million for last year’s fourth quarter. The segment operating margins were 10.6% compared with 12.8% for the 2010 fourth quarter. However, without the earn-out adjustment, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute, operating margins would have been approximately 12%. United’s strong performance continued in both the service and manufacturing sectors and their operating margins were in the low double-digits, which is higher than historical United operating margins and this is driven by higher volume leverage, which basically flowed through to the bottom-line. On the cash flow side, we continued to generate significant cash during 2011. Our EBITDA was 436 million for the year. Our capital spending for 2011 was $226 million and consisted of $115 million for new inland tank barges and tow boats, $33 million in progress payments for the two new offshore dry-bulk barge and tug units that Greg mentioned and then $78 million primarily for capital upgrades to existing inland and coast-wise equipment. Capital expenditures for K-Sea and the United were minimal. Our capital spending guidance for 2012 is currently in the range of $255 million to $265 million and that includes approximately $100 million for the construction of new equipment and approximately $70 million in progress payments for the two dry-bulk units that Greg noted. The balance is for upgrades to existing marine equipment and some small spending in the diesel engine services facilities area. As of December 31st we had $95 million outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility, which included the $42.7 million acquisition of the Seaboats fleet that we completed in the late fourth quarter. This morning our revolver's outstanding balance was $73 million. Now, I would like to talk about the earn-out. As you know, we have this earn-out in place as part of our acquisition of the United Holdings. The former owners received $270 million on closing, but can receive an additional $50 million payable in 2014 if certain financial targets are met during 2011, 2012 and 2013. The fair value estimate of the amount we think we will have to pay under this arrangement is determined each quarter and held as a contingent liability on our balance sheet. Any changes to the estimate we believe we will pay runs through the income statement. If we increased our estimate of the payout we would increase the contingent liability and it would lower our earnings. Conversely, if we lower the estimate we would reduce the liability, thereby increasing our earnings. During the fourth quarter we booked $3.7 million or $0.04 per share in expense as our estimate of the amount we would have to pay increased. For the year 2011 we booked a total of $6.3 million or $0.07 per share in expense. As there are two full years remaining for the earn-out period you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustment either up or down to this contingent liability. We have consequently excluded any potential changes to the earn-out contingent liability from our guidance. Joe will share our outlook and guidance shortly. I will now turn the call back to Joe."

There is certainly still some uncertainty in the US and world economies and this uncertainty is reflected somewhat in our 2012 guidance. Our 2012 year guidance range is $3.85 to $4.05 per share.

There is certainly still some uncertainty in the US and world economies and this uncertainty is reflected somewhat in our 2012 guidance. Our 2012 year guidance range is $3.85 to $4.05 per share. This compares with the $3.33 per share, which we just reported for the 2011 year. Our 2012 low end guidance of $3.85 assumes that our inland and costal marine transportation equipment utilization and pricing will be consistent with the 2011 second half and that our diesel engine service land based market will not be as strong as it was in 2011 with some second half softness in the manufacturing of principally hydraulic fracking units.
The high-end guidance of $4.05 per share assumes both marine transportation markets will improve modestly with corresponding higher term and spot contract pricing. On the diesel engine service side, our high end guidance assumes that our land-based market will be similar to what it was in 2011 with continued strong manufacturing and remanufacturing of hydraulic fracking equipment, as well as some modest improvement in our marine power generation and Gulf Coast oil service markets.
There has been much market discussion about the rapid expansion of fracking units in the oil and gas business and the effect of low natural gas prices on the need for drilling and fracturing equipment. We have had no customer cancelations and our 2012 backlog is about the same as it was this time last year.
Moving to the first quarter guidance of $0.86 to $0.93 per share; in our marine transportation segment we are forecasting that both our inland and coast-wise overall equipment utilization levels and pricing will remain relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. Weather issues and lock delays will impact the first quarter.
During January, we experienced of course some of these delays. The first quarter will also be negatively affected by a major maintenance issue with one of the key locks on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway which causes the lock to be deactivated for short periods of time.
In summary, 2011 was a terrific year for Kirby with record revenues, earnings and cash flow and of course we recorded the record results. Significant acquisitions completed in 2011 were positive in the marine transportation and diesel engine areas and the markets are complimentary to our legacy market and we believe position us well for continued growth.
Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow is excellent. Our two businesses which are in more challenging markets are coastal business and our legacy diesel engine business should improve as capacity tightens and volumes expand with respect to the coastal trade and drilling activity increases in the Gulf of Mexico with respect to our legacy diesel engine business.

So my question is the ordering for the fracking equipment, how did that progressed through the fourth quarter from beginning to end and so far earlier this year and do you feel that maybe your customers are a little bit more reluctant to order than six months ago as pressure pumping margins may have decreased?"

You know, the order pattern tends to be back-end loaded in the year. So you know, you work on your backlog through the first two quarters and then you build it back-up in the last two quarters. So far, as Joe indicated, the backlog’s approximately where it was at the beginning of last year. What we don’t know is what the strength of the year will be going forward, obviously, the low natural gas price is impacting gas directed fracturing, but a lot of our customers are moving their equipment to more oil directed as you would expect; we’re just a little cautious on how that might play out through the remainder of the year."

We talk a lot about United and pressure pumping, but really one of the big thrusts that United has had over the last year or so is to be able to diversify its product offering and we are now to the point where really we’ve expanded that product offering so we can provide all the equipment needed by a frac operation. So of course pressure pumps, so we also offer blenders, cementers, hydration units and transfer pumps and recently added the capability to provide our customers with a data van.
So, and one of the things that we’ve seen is interest in addition to what Dave has talked about an interest in the pressure pumping equipment; we’ve also seen some expanded interest in these other non-pressure pumping products. So we are excited about the diversification and the capability to provide our customers with a complete suite of frac equipment.
The other thing that we’ve been working on is the thing that really brought us to United in the first place and that is centered around the service component of the business as it relates to remanufacturing ability; you think about the frac market there is somewhere in the 7,000 frac pumps that are out there operating in very harsh conditions every day. And so we’ve been trying to position ourselves as one of the premier remanufacturers of this equipment as you can remanufacture and make like new a frac pump for roughly 60% to 70% of the cost of new.
As we go into 2012 this interest in remanufacturing is really strengthening as our customers, the operators of these fleets have been able to grow their fleet size to the point where they can take some capacity out and afford to have it offline and do this process which you know takes several weeks. And also they’ve had to established their capital budgets to accommodate this remanufacturing of frac fleets.
We did a small number of test units last year which were successful and we’ve got a more robust program as we go into 2012. And we have in place the marketing effort, the process for accomplishing this efficiently, the supply chain in place and then the people with the skill-sets required to deliver to our customers.
And to that finally I would say that the facility that we have where we really focus our manufacturing is flexible and allows us to do a mix of both new and remanufacturing pressure pumping units and also to build these non-pressure pumping also related products."

Jack and another component to that is probably even more important than the actual price of natural gas is the differential between crude oil and natural gas and historically it was between six and seven times. So you can multiply 250 times 7 and you can see the crude oil would be very, very low for petrochemical manufacturing complexes around the world, but a large number of them were based on liquid feedstock slates where the US manufacturing capacity was really based on cheap natural gas and people worried about that when gas back in the early 2000s spiked up to high single digits, low double-digit numbers and it’s really apparent that that we have got plenty of gas and that that is not going to happen for a while. And it also doesn’t look like crude oil is going to come down in value to the point where it goes back to its historical relationship. So we are not really worried about that and I think that based on that, you are beginning to see chemical companies talk about investments in North America and there’s been lots of noise and there have been already decisions to add additional capacity."

I am just trying to get a better sense for the margin at engine services. United was a mid to high single-digit margin business and I understand that Dave said that you are getting volume leverage there now from manufacturing, but the margin must have really expanded for the overall segment to come out at about 12%.

Clearly we are getting volume leverage. We haven't taken costs out of United and in fact they've been expanding because they've been ramping up their capacity. So what we've really seen is just that fixed cost spread as the volume of both manufactured equipment and service-related items and parts goes through their organization and more of it is just falling to the bottom line because the G&A cost aren’t going up in line with that as they exercise the leverage. Now I guess the second part of the question was, will margins drop, go back to a more normal range and I would say that it’s dependent on the volume. It will scale up and down with volume. Clearly if volume comes down we will address the cost structure but right now things are pretty much right-sized for where we are at."

And then, on the refining side, there has also been some in defense line addition capacity adds along the Gulf Coast to take advantage of all the infrastructure that’s available here and the refinery interplay that occurs as people trade and move intermediates between refineries to optimize the refinery runs.

And that's because you still have a very weak economy. And you still have unemployment that is, I guess, this morning it was 8.3% after adding 250,000 jobs and after 1.2 million people dropped out of the work force. That’s pretty negative. The GDP was a little better in the fourth quarter, but it’s expected to moderate. That’s the kind of thing that we’re talking about when I talked about the outlook. There is still a lot of uncertainty out there. But, even with all of that, I don’t think that we’re concerned in that legacy marine business that it’s in trouble at all. I think, that we stayed pretty busy throughout the quarter. Some slight weakness maybe in November, but it came back strong in December. Low inventory levels, not restocking is positive for us in that it actually creates more consistent demand when you stock up it, it creates some short-term demand, which then collapses, so we’re not sure that the environment that you just described is negative at all as we kind of understand our business and how it services those customers."

Late yesterday, we announced record setting net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter of a dollar per share reflecting a 69% improvement over the $0.59 per share reported for the 2010 fourth quarter. For the year, we announced record earnings of $3.33 per share, a 55% increase compared to $2.15 per share for 2010. Our record fourth quarter and year earnings were the result of strong demand for inland tank barge service, modest earnings contribution from our coastal marine tank barge business, strong earnings from our land-based diesel engine service business and improved earnings from our heritage marine diesel engine service business.
I will speak briefly about K-Sea’s results, our coastal tank barge operation. And I am going to turn the call over to Greg Binion who will update you on our inland marine transportation and diesel engine service markets.
With respect to K-Sea, K-Sea’s operating results were as expected for both fourth quarter and the year. Fourth quarter is generally a more difficult quarter for coastal business due to some seasonality in the cargos, we carry, principally the refined products and either the closure or a reduction in demand in Alaska and on the Great Lakes, as poor weather conditions affect those operations.
In addition, the fourth quarter included a $1,250,000 severance charge associated with integrating K-Sea’s back office into Kirby’s.
For the fourth quarter, K-Sea’s equipment utilization was approximately 75% to 80% with respect to pricing. Contracts in this market that renewed during the fourth quarter were basically flat and spot contracts improved in the low-to-mid single digit range year-over-year.
During the fourth quarter, approximately 60% of K-Sea’s revenues were under term contract and 40% were in the spot market.
Time charters in this coastal business represent approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts for the quarter. With refined product demand tying K-Sea more to the US economy than our inland operation, K-Sea’s equipment utilization levels and pricing environment remains below our inland transportation business.
As we continue to fine tune K-Sea’s cost structure, the US economy improves and industry capacity is removed from service, coastwise utilization rates should improve as well as K-Sea’s profitability. I will come back at the end of this call and talk about the full year and first quarter outlook for 2012 and let me turn the call now over to Greg."
283986,145779835,264354,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2012",2012-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to all. During the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector continued its strong performance with high utilization rates and favorable pricing trends. Low price natural gas continued to positively impact the",865,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to all. During the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector continued its strong performance with high utilization rates and favorable pricing trends. Low price natural gas continued to positively impact the global competitiveness of the US petrochemical industry. The feedstock advantage provided continued strong volumes of domestically produced petrochemicals for domestic consumption and exportation.
Kirby’s black oil fleet continues to see strong demand driven by stable refinery output and the movement of crude from the Midwest of the Gulf Coast and also out of South Texas. Our refined products demand remain positive benefitting from the Midwest to Gulf Coast movements of ethanol and our agricultural demand was also brisk benefitting both from domestic lead produced and imported ag products. Consequently during the 2011 fourth quarter Kirby’s petrochemical and black oil inland fleets achieved utilization rates in the low to mid 90% range.
Revenue from our long-term contracts that is one year in duration or longer remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and our freight business continued at about 55% and 45% respectively 
Turning now to inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts which renewed during the fourth quarter achieved rate increases in the mid single-digit range when compared with the 2010 fourth quarter. Spot contract pricing which includes the price of fuel saw rate increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared with the 2011 third quarter. Our multi-year contracts have annual escalations based on labor and producer price index. Some of these are adjusted each January and the adjustment effective on January 1, 2012 provided rate increases in the 2% range.
During 2011, we continue to invest in our inland fleet, both in terms of the new construction and upgrading existing barges. This reduces maintenance cost and out-of-service days and improves the reliability of our fleet and our service to our customers. If we roll forward to the end of 2012 and exclude our non-certificated fleet which moves primarily fertilizer solutions, our average inland tank barge fleet age will be about 16.5 years old.
During 2011, we took delivery of 38 new 30,000 barrel tank barges and two new pressure barges totaling approximately 1.1 million barrels of capacity. During 2011, we retired 66 tank barges totaling 1.25 million barrels of capacity. We also added 20 tank barges with the purchase of the ship bunkering operation of Enterprise in February of 2011 adding approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity. So net net, during 2011 our active inland tank barge fleet capacity increased by about 250,000 barrels.
As of December 31, 2011 we operated 819 tank barges with a capacity of 16.2 million barrels. We also took delivery of one 2000 horsepower inland towboat in the 2011 fourth quarter. For 2012 our construction program will consist of 25, 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 30 new 10,000 barrels inland tank barges with the total capacity of approximately one million barrels. We are also building five canal towboats for 2012 delivery. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats is approximately $100 million, the majority of which will be expended in 2012. We will also continue to retire our older inland tank barges during 2012. In the 2012 fourth quarter, we also expect to take delivery of two new offshore articulated, dry cargo barge and tug units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million. During 2011 we did make progress payments on these two units totaling $33 million and the balance will be paid in 2012. For 2011 we estimate the industry placed into service approximately 160 inland tank barges, 40 of which were Kirbys. We estimate that a 100 to 125 were retired from service, the majority of which were 35 years or older. Due to improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil products barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment, we estimate that approximately 235 inland tank barges were on order industry-wide for delivery throughout 2012, 55 of these are Kirbys. Short to medium term we don't see this as a problem for the industry as we believe that increased market volumes and fleet retirements will keep supply and demand in relative balance.
Turning now to our diesel engine services segment; our April 15 acquisition of United had a positive impact on Kirby’s fourth quarter and the full year financial results. United contributed approximately 75% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue for the fourth quarter. United's operating margin was in the low double-digit range. With continued exploration and development of the nation’s shale formations, United’s revenue and operating margins were better than expected. Manufacturing and servicing of hydraulic fracturing equipment and the sale of land base transmissions and diesel engines remains robust. Finally our legacy diesel engine services segment, which involves the marine market also improved, as well as our power generation market with engine generator set upgrades, parts and services all being stable. The Gulf Coast oil service market was similar to the third quarter with lower than historical levels of drilling rigs working in the gulf in the resulting competitive environment for service work. I will now turn this call over to David."

Good morning, I will talk about margins and then provide a few more other financial details.

Good morning, I will talk about margins and then provide a few more other financial details. Continued strong performance in our inland transportation sector and the purchase of K-Sea effective July 1st resulted in Kirby’s marine transportation revenues being 44% above and operating income 48% above the 2010 fourth quarter. 
The marine segments operating margin was 21.8% compared with 21.2% for the 2010 fourth quarter. Without the severance charge at K-Sea, operating margins would have been 22.2% for the fourth quarter. As Greg noted, during the fourth quarter, our inland marine transportation sector had continued high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range, with some softness in November, but a fairly strong rebound in December. So our legacy marine transportation sector maintained its strong operating margins in the mid-20% range during the fourth quarter. K-Sea, which contributed approximately 20% of fourth quarter’s marine transportation segment’s revenues, they contributed to our fourth quarter operating income with margins in the low single-digit range. 
With the acquisition of United, our diesel engine services revenues increased to $215 million in the quarter from $54 million a year-ago and operating income was $23 million compared with $7 million for last year’s fourth quarter. The segment operating margins were 10.6% compared with 12.8% for the 2010 fourth quarter. However, without the earn-out adjustment, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute, operating margins would have been approximately 12%. 
United’s strong performance continued in both the service and manufacturing sectors and their operating margins were in the low double-digits, which is higher than historical United operating margins and this is driven by higher volume leverage, which basically flowed through to the bottom-line. On the cash flow side, we continued to generate significant cash during 2011. Our EBITDA was 436 million for the year. Our capital spending for 2011 was $226 million and consisted of $115 million for new inland tank barges and tow boats, $33 million in progress payments for the two new offshore dry-bulk barge and tug units that Greg mentioned and then $78 million primarily for capital upgrades to existing inland and coast-wise equipment. 
Capital expenditures for K-Sea and the United were minimal. Our capital spending guidance for 2012 is currently in the range of $255 million to $265 million and that includes approximately $100 million for the construction of new equipment and approximately $70 million in progress payments for the two dry-bulk units that Greg noted. The balance is for upgrades to existing marine equipment and some small spending in the diesel engine services facilities area. 
As of December 31st we had $95 million outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility, which included the $42.7 million acquisition of the Seaboats fleet that we completed in the late fourth quarter. This morning our revolver's outstanding balance was $73 million. 
Now, I would like to talk about the earn-out. As you know, we have this earn-out in place as part of our acquisition of the United Holdings. The former owners received $270 million on closing, but can receive an additional $50 million payable in 2014 if certain financial targets are met during 2011, 2012 and 2013. The fair value estimate of the amount we think we will have to pay under this arrangement is determined each quarter and held as a contingent liability on our balance sheet. 
Any changes to the estimate we believe we will pay runs through the income statement. If we increased our estimate of the payout we would increase the contingent liability and it would lower our earnings. Conversely, if we lower the estimate we would reduce the liability, thereby increasing our earnings. During the fourth quarter we booked $3.7 million or $0.04 per share in expense as our estimate of the amount we would have to pay increased. 
For the year 2011 we booked a total of $6.3 million or $0.07 per share in expense. As there are two full years remaining for the earn-out period you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustment either up or down to this contingent liability. We have consequently excluded any potential changes to the earn-out contingent liability from our guidance. Joe will share our outlook and guidance shortly. I will now turn the call back to Joe."

There is certainly still some uncertainty in the US and world economies and this uncertainty is reflected somewhat in our 2012 guidance. Our 2012 year guidance range is $3.85 to $4.05 per share.

There is certainly still some uncertainty in the US and world economies and this uncertainty is reflected somewhat in our 2012 guidance. Our 2012 year guidance range is $3.85 to $4.05 per share. This compares with the $3.33 per share, which we just reported for the 2011 year. Our 2012 low end guidance of $3.85 assumes that our inland and costal marine transportation equipment utilization and pricing will be consistent with the 2011 second half and that our diesel engine service land based market will not be as strong as it was in 2011 with some second half softness in the manufacturing of principally hydraulic frac-ing units.
The high-end guidance of $4.05 per share assumes both marine transportation markets will improve modestly with corresponding higher term and spot contract pricing. On the diesel engine service side, our high end guidance assumes that our land-based market will be similar to what it was in 2011 with continued strong manufacturing and remanufacturing of hydraulic frac-ing equipment, as well as some modest improvement in our marine power generation and Gulf Coast oil service markets.
There has been much market discussion about the rapid expansion of frac-ing units in the oil and gas business and the effect of low natural gas prices on the need for drilling and fracturing equipment. We have had no customer cancelations and our 2012 backlog is about the same as it was this time last year.
Moving to the first quarter guidance of $0.86 to $0.93 per share; in our marine transportation segment we are forecasting that both our inland and coast-wise overall equipment utilization levels and pricing will remain relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. Weather issues and lock delays will impact the first quarter.
During January, we experienced of course some of these delays. The first quarter will also be negatively affected by a major maintenance issue with one of the key locks on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway which causes the lock to be deactivated for short periods of time.
In summary, 2011 was a terrific year for Kirby with record revenues, earnings and cash flow and of course we recorded the record results. Significant acquisitions completed in 2011 were positive in the marine transportation and diesel engine areas and the markets are complementary to our legacy market and we believe position us well for continued growth.
Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow is excellent. Our two businesses which are in more challenging markets are coastal business and our legacy diesel engine business should improve as capacity tightens and volumes expand with respect to the coastal trade and drilling activity increases in the Gulf of Mexico with respect to our legacy diesel engine business.
Operator, that’s all of our prepared remarks. We’re now ready to take questions."

You know, the order pattern tends to be back-end loaded in the year. So you know, you work on your backlog through the first two quarters and then you build it back-up in the last two quarters. So far, as Joe indicated, the backlog’s approximately where it was at the beginning of last year. What we don’t know is what the strength of the year will be going forward, obviously, the low natural gas price is impacting gas directed fracturing, but a lot of our customers are moving their equipment to more oil directed as you would expect; we’re just a little cautious on how that might play out through the remainder of the year."

We talk a lot about United and pressure pumping, but really one of the big thrusts that United has had over the last year or so is to be able to diversify its product offering and we are now to the point where really we’ve expanded that product offering so we can provide all the equipment needed by a frac operation. So of course pressure pumps, so we also offer blenders, cementers, hydration units and transfer pumps and recently added the capability to provide our customers with a data van.
So, and one of the things that we’ve seen is interest in addition to what Dave has talked about an interest in the pressure pumping equipment; we’ve also seen some expanded interest in these other non-pressure pumping products. So we are excited about the diversification and the capability to provide our customers with a complete suite of frac equipment. The other thing that we’ve been working on is the thing that really brought us to United in the first place and that is centered around the service component of the business as it relates to remanufacturing ability; you think about the frac market there is somewhere in the 7,000 frac pumps that are out there operating in very harsh conditions every day. And so we’ve been trying to position ourselves as one of the premier remanufacturers of this equipment as you can remanufacture and make like new a frac pump for roughly 60% to 70% of the cost of new. As we go into 2012 this interest in remanufacturing is really strengthening as our customers, the operators of these fleets have been able to grow their fleet size to the point where they can take some capacity out and afford to have it offline and do this process which you know takes several weeks. And also they’ve had to established their capital budgets to accommodate this remanufacturing of frac fleets.
We did a small number of test units last year which were successful and we’ve got a more robust program as we go into 2012. And we have in place the marketing effort, the process for accomplishing this efficiently, the supply chain in place and then the people with the skill-sets required to deliver to our customers. And to that finally I would say that the facility that we have where we really focus our manufacturing is flexible and allows us to do a mix of both new and remanufacturing pressure pumping units and also to build these non-pressure pumping also related products."

Jack and another component to that is probably even more important than the actual price of natural gas is the differential between crude oil and natural gas and historically it was between six and seven times. So you can multiply 250 times 7 and you can see the crude oil would be very, very low for petrochemical manufacturing complexes around the world, but a large number of them were based on liquid feedstock slates where the US manufacturing capacity was really based on cheap natural gas and people worried about that when gas back in the early 2000s spiked up to high single digits, low double-digit numbers and it’s really apparent that that we have got plenty of gas and that that is not going to happen for a while. And it also doesn’t look like crude oil is going to come down in value to the point where it goes back to its historical relationship. So we are not really worried about that and I think that based on that, you are beginning to see chemical companies talk about investments in North America and there’s been lots of noise and there have been already decisions to add additional capacity."

I think what the chemical companies are saying is that it’s going to be modest growth and listening to the Class I railroads, I think they are also saying that and that's kind of what we are saying that chemical capacity is going to be growing modestly until more facilities come online. And that's because you still have a very weak economy. And you still have unemployment that is, I guess, this morning it was 8.3% after adding 250,000 jobs and after 1.2 million people dropped out of the work force. That’s pretty negative. The GDP was a little better in the fourth quarter, but it’s expected to moderate. That’s the kind of thing that we’re talking about when I talked about the outlook. There is still a lot of uncertainty out there. But, even with all of that, I don’t think that we’re concerned in that legacy marine business that it’s in trouble at all. I think, that we stayed pretty busy throughout the quarter. Some slight weakness maybe in November, but it came back strong in December. Low inventory levels, not restocking is positive for us in that it actually creates more consistent demand when you stock up it, it creates some short-term demand, which then collapses, so we’re not sure that the environment that you just described is negative at all as we kind of understand our business and how it services those customers."

Late yesterday afternoon we announced net earnings for the 2012 first quarter of $0.91 per share, reflecting a 52% improvement over the $0.60 per share reported for the same period last year. Our first quarter earnings guidance was $0.86 to $0.93 per share. In our first quarter results, there were two charges that were not included in our guidance range: a $4.2 million before tax charge, or $0.05 a share, which was the earn-out charge pertaining to the United acquisition; and a $2.4 million before tax, or $0.03 per share, severance charge associated with the integration of K-Sea into Kirby. David’s going to talk about both these charges in more detail later in the call.
Our record first quarter earnings were the result of a continued strong demand for our inland tank barge business, a strong performance from our land-based Diesel Engine Service business and improved earnings from our legacy Marine Diesel Engine Service business. Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was about as expected given the seasonality of this business and some continued overcapacity in the coastal tank barge fleet.
In April we changed the name of K-Sea Transportation to Kirby Offshore Marine, more fully integrated our coastal operation into the Kirby family of marine transportation companies. With this renaming, we have begun the process of rebranding equipment, the organization and the service. Jim Farley was named President of Kirby Offshore Marine, having previously served as the Executive Vice President of Operations for Kirby Inland Marine. David Grzebinski will serve as Kirby Offshore Marine’s Chairman as well as Kirby Corporation’s CFO. I look forward to working with both Jim and David as we more fully integrate Kirby Offshore Marine into our marine transportation business.
Our focus is to continue to enhance this service model with the objective of providing our customers the best and safest service in the industry.
Now our legacy inland tank barge business is performing well with favorable pricing trends. We anticipate this sector to remain positive based on the favorable outlook of the U.S. petrochemical and refining industry.
For the Diesel Engine segment, our legacy business is improving due to the overall health of it inland marine transportation customers and an improved Gulf of Mexico oil service market. For our land-based Diesel Engine Service business, with the current low price of natural gas incentive to drill for natural gas has declined but the incentive to find crude oil remains very positive due to the current high price of crude oil. This business is seeing a natural rotation away from natural gas to oil exploration. As this rotation occurs, there has been a pause in new orders for the oil service equipment as the market assesses its requirements. We are using this pause to further develop the service opportunities in this business.
When we purchased United it was our objective to apply a very good, well-tested marine diesel engine service model to land-based diesel engines. It is our intention to continue to build oil service equipment, but to more heavily focus on servicing this equipment rather than manufacturing it. Later in the call Greg will share with you some encouraging comments regarding remanufacturing service opportunities. Then I’ll come back at the end of the call and talk about the second quarter as well as the full year outlook.
Now I’m going to turn the call over to David, who will speak briefly about Kirby Offshore Marine’s markets and then Greg will update you on our inland tank barge business and the Diesel Engine Service markets.

Kirby Offshore Marine’s operating results, including the severance charge, were a bit above break even for the first quarter. As we have mentioned before, the fourth and first quarters are more difficult for our coastal operation due to seasonality. The closure or a significant reduction in demand in Alaska and on the Great Lakes, as well as poor operating efficiency caused by winter weather conditions. Also during the first quarter unseasonably mild weather in New York and the Northeast market negatively impacted demand for distillate products, particularly heating oil, which resulted in lower equipment utilization and rates in the New York and Northeast market.
As Joe mentioned, in the 2012 first quarter we took a $2.4 million or $0.03 per share charge related to severance which was for the integration of Kirby Offshore Marine’s administrative functions into Kirby. We have made the decisions and taken the steps, some of them painful from a personnel standpoint, to fully integrate Kirby Offshore Marine into the Kirby Marine family. As part of this integration, we will be closing our East Brunswick New Jersey office and consolidating our East Coast operations into our existing Staten Island, New York operations facility.
For the first quarter Kirby Offshore Marine’s equipment utilization rate was in the 75% to 80% range. With respect to pricing, contracts that renewed during the first quarter and spot contracts were basically flat. Approximately 60% of Kirby Offshore Marine’s revenues were under term contract and 40% were spot. Time charters represented approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts during the quarter.
As we have stated before, our coastal operations primarily transport refined products, tying it more to the U.S. economy, which is a contrast to our inland fleet, which is seeing strong leverage from the chemical market. Offshore marine equipment utilization levels in pricing are weaker than in our inland transportation business. As we continue to fine tune our coastal operations, reduce costs and seek additional coastal transportation opportunities with our existing inland marine customers, our profitability will improve. Furthermore, as the U.S. economy improves and the industry’s single hold tank barges, which currently comprised approximately 8% of the coastwise capacity, when those are removed from service between now and the end of 2014 we fully expect coastal utilization and rates to improve.
I will now turn the call over to Greg.

During the first quarter our inland marine transportation sector continued a strong performance, with high utilization rates and favorable pricing trends. The U.S. produced Petrochemicals for both domestic consumption and exportation remains strong, as U.S.-produced low price natural gas continues to provide a feed stock advantage, thereby continuing the global competitiveness of the U.S. Petrochemical industry.
Kirby’s black oil fleet continued to see strong demand, driven by a stable refinery output and the movement of crude oil from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast and from South Texas. Our refined products demand remained positive, benefiting from Midwest to Gulf Coast movements of ethanol. In the agricultural chemical market the traditional spring fill started early, transporting both domestically produced and imported products. This has been driven by warmer than normal weather and low fertilizer inventories coupled with high corn prices.
Our petrochemical and black oil inland fleets operated at utilization levels in the low to mid 90% range during the first quarter. Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75%, and the mix of time charter and affreightment business continued at about 55% and 45% respectively.
Turning to the inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts that renewed during the first quarter continued to be renewed in the range of mid single-digit levels, in some cases were slightly higher when compared with the same period during 2011. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rates increase modestly when compared sequentially to the 2011 fourth quarter. Our multi-year contracts have annual increases based on labor in the producer price index and some of these are adjusted each January and the adjustments to this year, which were effective January 1, provided rate increases in the 2% range.
During the 2012 first quarter we continued to invest in our inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges, thereby reducing maintenance costs and out of service days and improving the reliability of the fleet and our customer service. We took delivery of five new 30,000 barrel tank barges totaling approximately 140,000 barrels of capacity and retired 16 tank barges and returned two charter barges, thereby reducing capacity by approximately 300,000 barrels.
So net-net during the 2012 first quarter, our inland tank barge fleet declined by 13 tank barges and our capacity decreased by approximately 160,000 barrels. As of May 31st, we operated 806 tank barges with a capacity of 16 million barrels. During the quarter we also took delivery of one 2,000 horsepower inland towboat.
For the remaining nine months of 2012, our construction program will consist of 20 new 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 30 new 10,000 barrel tank barges with the total capacity of approximately 875,000 barrels. We will also take delivery of four new additional canal towboats.
The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats remaining in our construction program is approximately $90 million, the majority of which will be expended during 2012. We will also continue to retire older barges during 2012. At the present time we anticipate that our 2012 year-end capacity to be approximately 16.5 million barrels, or about 300,000 barrels above the 16.2 million barrels that we had at the beginning of the year.
In the 2012 fourth quarter we will also take delivery of two new offshore articulated dry-bulk tug barge units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 we made progress payments on these two units totaling approximately $52 million and the balance will be paid through the remaining nine months of 2012.
Turning to our Diesel Engine Service segment. United, our land-based drilling service provider, contributed about 75% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue during the first quarter. Their operating margin was in the high single digits. The quarter benefited from the start up of remanufacturing hydraulic fracturing equipment.
We’re making good progress towards our stated objective of moving United to a business which is focused on the more stable service business. This will be accomplished by increasing our business levels in remanufacturing and to a lesser extent the parts and service and distribution business so that reman and service is the majority of what we do.
Let me express this in terms of revenue. In 2011 approximately 55% of United’s revenue was from manufacturing. Primarily the assembly of oil field service equipment. For 2012 we are forecasting that this will reverse. In about 55% to 60% of United’s revenue will be from re-manufacturing parts and service as we anticipate that the demand for reman will continue to increase as manufacturing slows later in the year.
Currently we have 27 units either in the process of being re-manufactured or in the queue to start, with commitments from our customers to send more units as capacity becomes available at our reman facility. Our vision for United is that the reman and service business forms a stable base on top of which we can layer in manufacturing business activity as the market presents the opportunity to do so.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Services segment marine market reported higher results benefiting from large overhaul projects for both domestic and international marine customers as well as the return of drilling rigs to the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. The legacy Power Generation business benefited from engine generator setup grades, service and part sales.
I will now turn the call back over to David.

Let me provide a few financial details for the quarter. Our continued strong performance in the inland transportation sector and the addition of K-Sea Transportation, now Kirby Offshore Marine, in July 1 of last year resulted in our Marine Transportation revenues being 39% above and operating income 30% above the 2011 first quarter. The Marine segment’s first quarter operating margin was 20.4% compared with 21.8% for the first quarter of 2011.
As Greg noted, during the first quarter our Inland Marine Transportation sector’s 90% to 95% equipment utilization continued along with favorable pricing. Our legacy Marine Transportation sector maintained its strong operating margin in the mid 20% range during the first quarter.
Kirby Offshore Marine contributed approximately 20% of the first quarter’s Marine Transportation revenues, but with the $2.4 million severance charge, its contribution to our first quarter operating income was only slightly positive.
With the acquisition of United in the second quarter of 2011, our Diesel Engine Services revenues increased $231 million in the first quarter from $58 million a year ago and operating income was $23.6 million compared with $6.6 million in the first quarter of last year. The segment’s operating margin was 10.2% compared with 11.5% for the 2011 first quarter. United’s performance continued to be strong as they worked through their manufacturing backlog and ramped up service and remanufacturing. United’s operating margin was in the high single-digit range for the quarter.
We continued to generate significant cash during the first quarter with EBITDA of $125 million. Our capital spending for the first quarter was $62 million and consisted of $21 million for new inland tank barges and towboats, $19 million in progress payments on the two new offshore dry-bulk barge and tug units Greg mentioned and $22 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing inland and coastwise fleet.
Our capital spending guidance for 2012 is $265 to $275 million, and it includes $110 million for construction and new equipment and approximately $70 million in progress payments for the two offshore dry bulk units. The balance would be for upgrades to existing marine equipment and some to diesel engine service facilities. As of March 31, we had $72.5 million outstanding on our $250 million revolving credit facility.
Now I want to once again talk a little bit about the earn-out that we have in place for our acquisition of United Holdings. The former owners received $271 million on closing, but can receive an additional $50 million payable in 2014 if certain financial targets are met during 2011, 2012 and 2013. The fair value estimate of the amount we think we will have to pay under this agreement is determined each quarter and held as a contingent liability on our balance sheet. Any changes to the estimate we believe we will pay runs through the income statement. If we increase our estimate of the payout we would increase the contingent liability and it would lower our earnings. Conversely, if we lower the estimate we would reduce the liability and thereby increase our earnings.
During the first quarter we booked $4.2 million or $0.05 per share in expense as our estimate of the amount we would have to pay if this earn-out increased. As there are about two full years remaining for the earn-out period, you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustments, either up or down to the contingent liability. If consequently excluded any past or potential changes to the earn-out liability from our 2012 earnings guidance.
I’ll now turn the call back to Joe.

Our 2011 second quarter results included United purchased on April 15, 2011, but did not include Kirby Offshore Marine purchased on July 1, 2011. As David explained, our 2012 second quarter guidance is before any positive or negative change to United’s multi-year contingent earn-out liability. For the year our guidance remains at the $3.85 to $4.05 per share compared to actual earnings in 2011 of $3.33 per share.
As I stated at the beginning of the call, our Inland Marine Transportation business is performing at a very high level, with favorable pricing trends, and we anticipate this performance to continue. We have 50 new barges scheduled to be delivered throughout the balance of 2012. That will further enhance our inland performance as well as profitability. As we’ve stated since the purchase of our coastal fleet in July of 2011, the coastal market is not a next quarter story, but will improve over the next couple of years. We do expect the coastal fleet will be profitable with operating margins in the high single-digit area.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service business should improve going forward with increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
Perhaps the largest variable in our guidance is United and the impact of the recent transition away from drilling for natural gas to the exploration of crude oil, and the impact this transition will have on new orders for equipment. We do anticipate a decrease in demand for new equipment, however, we believe this pause is providing an opportunity to free up some capacity for pressure pumping remanufacturing and will allow us to further developed and enhance that service model that really is our vision for the business when we bought it.

So right now what we’ve accrued for our earn-out is what we actually think will occur.
But as you know, as time goes on, you get new data points, stronger or weaker, and you factor that into your probability models. So it’s a hard way - it’s hard to predict what will happen with the earn-out but right now we think we’re appropriately accrued for the earn-out with our forward look for the next year and a half, two years.

But we still have a pretty healthy backlog that we’re running with. When I say pause, I think that the market is just kind of stepping back and assessing what the transition from principally looking for gas to principally looking for oil really means for equipment demand. And you also have some logistics challenges as you move equipment that’s working in a particular area to another area. You have to get it there. You have to get the fracking material and some fluid there. You have to arrange for water. It’s a process that’s going to take a while to settle down.
What I think is different about this point in the oil service cycle is that typically when this happens, the whole sectors collapse. Energy prices have collapsed because traditionally natural gas and crude oil traded at a ratio that was driven more by the BTUs that each produced. Here you have a decoupling of natural gas and crude oil. So you don’t have a collapse, you just have a shift from based on price. The thing that we like to say here is that capitalism works: where you think you can make money, that’s where you go. You’re struggling to make money in the gas exploration area, the crude oil is priced so that you can make a lot of money in that area. And the world has got to figure out how you get the equipment there and what it means when it gets there.
There’s a lot of talk about margins collapsing in that business. I think most businesses would love to have that kind of margin collapse. You’re going from extremely high operating margins to more traditional margins. So I’m not particularly concerned that there’s not going to be enthusiasm for doing this. You’re still making plenty of money. Just trying to re-assess what it all means.

And the thought is that some of it’s going to come up the pipeline and some of it will come up from the Gulf Coast by U.S. flag marine vessels.
That’s going to be moved principally in larger vessels than we operate. Now there are going to be some blending components that we could move and as they continue to narrow the diesel spec, there may be some diesel movements that would logically fall into smaller lots that would fit our vessels. But those kind of discussions, except on a very general, really aren’t occurring yet. I think there is more speculation about refineries closing and how that product is going to get up there than actual contractual discussions on moving it.

Very good. One of the railroads talked earlier this week when they announced earnings that they were having difficulty signing longer term contracts for crude by rail movements to justify building additional storage facilities and the like in South Texas. Are you seeing that maybe Kirby is running into more opportunities to move crude, either down in Mississippi or out of the Eagle Ford at the expense of the rails because your model may be a little bit more flexible, a little bit more able to handle things on a spot basis? Where maybe the rails aren’t as set up for that?

Where the rail play is, is out of Cushing and out of Bakken. There is some talk about moving Bakken crude to St. Louis where it would be put on barge. I think with respect to the Eagle Ford, what we’ve said about barging volumes out of the Eagle Ford is that right now you don’t have a good pipeline gathering system. They are putting in pipelines and we think that there’s always going to be barging but at some point the amount of new equipment that you’re going to put in there is going to be capped. That the excess crude oil is going to be moved by pipeline.
My guess is what you’re hearing with respect to the railroads is more what’s happening with Cushing because there’s pipelines that are planned and talked about at Cushing and also pipelines that are being put in at the Bakken. And there’s resistance to long-term agreement with railroads until you really understand what those pipelines do.

On the demand side, the economy is weak.

Late yesterday afternoon we announced net earnings for the 2012 first quarter of $0.91 per share, reflecting a 52% improvement over the $0.60 per share reported for the same period last year. Our first quarter earnings guidance was $0.86 to $0.93 per share. In our first quarter results, there were 2 charges that were not included in our guidance range: a $4.2 million before tax charge, or $0.05 a share, which was the earn-out charge pertaining to the United acquisition; and a $2.4 million before tax, or $0.03 per share, severance charge associated with the integration of K-Sea into Kirby. David’s going to talk about both these charges in more detail later in the call.
Our record first quarter earnings were the result of a continued strong demand for our inland tank barge business, a strong performance from our land-based Diesel Engine Service business and improved earnings from our legacy Marine Diesel Engine Service business. Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was about as expected given the seasonality of this business and some continued overcapacity in the coastal tank barge fleet.
In April we changed the name of K-Sea Transportation to Kirby Offshore Marine, more fully integrating our coastal operation into the Kirby family of marine transportation companies. With this renaming, we have begun the process of rebranding equipment, the organization and the service. Jim Farley was named President of Kirby Offshore Marine, having previously served as the Executive Vice President of Operations for Kirby Inland Marine. David Grzebinski will serve as Kirby Offshore Marine’s Chairman as well as Kirby Corporation’s CFO. I look forward to working with both Jim and David as we more fully integrate Kirby Offshore Marine into our marine transportation business.
Our focus is to continue to enhance this service model with the objective of providing our customers the best and safest service in the industry.
Now our legacy inland tank barge business is performing well with favorable pricing trends. We anticipate this sector to remain positive based on the favorable outlook of the U.S. petrochemical and refining industry.
For the Diesel Engine segment, our legacy business is improving due to the overall health of its inland marine transportation customers and an improved Gulf of Mexico oil service market. For our land-based Diesel Engine Service business, with the current low price of natural gas incentive to drill for natural gas has declined but the incentive to find crude oil remains very positive due to the current high price of crude oil. This business is seeing a natural rotation away from natural gas to oil exploration. As this rotation occurs, there has been a pause in new orders for the oil service equipment as the market assesses its requirements. We are using this pause to further develop the service opportunities in this business.
When we purchased United it was our objective to apply a very good, well-tested marine diesel engine service model to land-based diesel engines. It is our intention to continue to build oil service equipment, but to more heavily focus on servicing this equipment rather than manufacturing it. Later in the call Greg will share with you some encouraging comments regarding remanufacturing service opportunities. Then I’ll come back at the end of the call and talk about the second quarter as well as the full year outlook.
Now I’m going to turn the call over to David, who will speak briefly about Kirby Offshore Marine’s markets and then Greg will update you on our inland tank barge business and the Diesel Engine Service markets."

The",390,"Kirby Offshore Marine’s operating results, including the severance charge, were a bit above breakeven for the first quarter. As we have mentioned before, the fourth and first quarters are more difficult for our coastal operation due to seasonality. The closure or a significant reduction in demand in Alaska and on the Great Lakes, as well as poor operating efficiency caused by winter weather conditions. Also during the first quarter, unseasonably mild weather in New York and the Northeast market negatively impacted demand for distillate products, particularly heating oil, which resulted in lower equipment utilization and rates in the New York and Northeast market.
As Joe mentioned, in the 2012 first quarter we took a $2.4 million or $0.03 per share charge related to severance which was for the integration of Kirby Offshore Marine’s administrative functions into Kirby. We have made the decisions and taken the steps, some of them painful from a personnel standpoint, to fully integrate Kirby Offshore Marine into the Kirby Marine family. As part of this integration, we will be closing our East Brunswick New Jersey office and consolidating our East Coast operations into our existing Staten Island, New York operations facility.
For the first quarter Kirby Offshore Marine’s equipment utilization rate was in the 75% to 80% range. With respect to pricing, contracts that renewed during the first quarter and spot contracts were basically flat. Approximately 60% of Kirby Offshore Marine’s revenues were under term contract and 40% were spot. Time charters represented approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts during the quarter.
As we have stated before, our coastal operations primarily transport refined products, tying it more to the U.S. economy, which is a contrast to our inland fleet, which is seeing strong leverage from the chemical market. Offshore marine equipment utilization levels in pricing are weaker than in our inland transportation business. As we continue to fine tune our coastal operations, reduce costs and seek additional coastal transportation opportunities with our existing inland marine customers, our profitability will improve. Furthermore, as the U.S. economy improves and the industry’s single hold tank barges, which currently comprise approximately 8% of the coastwise capacity, when those are removed from service between now and the end of 2014, we fully expect coastal utilization and rates to improve.
I will now turn the call over to Greg."
283986,184271418,290523,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","During the first quarter our inland marine transportation sector continued a strong performance, with high utilization rates and favorable pricing trends.

The U.S. produced Petrochemicals for both domestic consumption and exportation remains strong, as U.S.-produced low price natural gas continues to provide a feed stock advantage, thereby continuing the global competitiveness of the U.S. Petrochemical industry.
Kirby’s black oil fleet continued to see strong demand, driven by a stable refinery output and the movement of crude oil from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast and from South Texas. Our refined products demand remained positive, benefiting from Midwest to Gulf Coast movements of ethanol. In the agricultural chemical market the traditional spring fill started early, transporting both domestically produced and imported products. This has been driven by warmer than normal weather and low fertilizer inventories coupled with high corn prices.
Our petrochemical and black oil inland fleets operated at utilization levels in the low to mid 90% range during the first quarter. Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75%, and the mix of time charter and affreightment business continued at about 55% and 45% respectively.
Turning to the inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts that renewed during the first quarter continued to be renewed in the range of mid single-digit levels, in some cases were slightly higher when compared with the same period during 2011. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rates increase modestly when compared sequentially to the 2011 fourth quarter. Our multi-year contracts have annual increases based on labor in the producer price index and some of these are adjusted each January and the adjustments to this year, which were effective January 1, provided rate increases in the 2% range.
During the 2012 first quarter we continued to invest in our inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges, thereby reducing maintenance costs and out of service days and improving the reliability of the fleet and our customer service. We took delivery of five new 30,000 barrel tank barges totaling approximately 140,000 barrels of capacity and retired 16 tank barges and returned 2 charter barges, thereby reducing capacity by approximately 300,000 barrels.
So net-net during the 2012 first quarter, our inland tank barge fleet declined by 13 tank barges and our capacity decreased by approximately 160,000 barrels. As of May 31st, we operated 806 tank barges with a capacity of 16 million barrels. During the quarter we also took delivery of one 2,000 horsepower inland towboat.
For the remaining 9 months of 2012, our construction program will consist of 20 new 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 30 new 10,000 barrel tank barges with the total capacity of approximately 875,000 barrels. We will also take delivery of 4 new additional canal towboats.
The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats remaining in our construction program is approximately $90 million, the majority of which will be expended during 2012. We will also continue to retire older barges during 2012. At the present time we anticipate that our 2012 year-end capacity to be approximately 16.5 million barrels, or about 300,000 barrels above the 16.2 million barrels that we had at the beginning of the year.
In the 2012 fourth quarter we will also take delivery of 2 new offshore articulated dry-bulk tug barge units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 we made progress payments on these 2 units totaling approximately $52 million and the balance will be paid through the remaining 9 months of 2012.
Turning to our Diesel Engine Service segment. United, our land-based drilling service provider, contributed about 75% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue during the first quarter. Their operating margin was in the high single digits. The quarter benefited from the startup of remanufacturing hydraulic fracturing equipment.
We’re making good progress towards our stated objective of moving United to a business which is focused on the more stable service business. This will be accomplished by increasing our business levels in remanufacturing and to a lesser extent the parts and service and distribution business so that reman and service is the majority of what we do.
Let me express this in terms of revenue. In 2011 approximately 55% of United’s revenue was from manufacturing. Primarily the assembly of oil field service equipment. For 2012 we are forecasting that this will reverse. In about 55% to 60% of United’s revenue will be from re-manufacturing parts and service as we anticipate that the demand for reman will continue to increase as manufacturing slows later in the year.
Currently we have 27 units either in the process of being re-manufactured or in the queue to start, with commitments from our customers to send more units as capacity becomes available at our reman facility. Our vision for United is that the reman and service business forms a stable base on top of which we can layer in manufacturing business activity as the market presents the opportunity to do so.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Services segment marine market reported higher results benefiting from large overhaul projects for both domestic and international marine customers as well as the return of drilling rigs to the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. The legacy Power Generation business benefited from engine generator setup grades, service and part sales.
I will now turn the call back over to David."

Our continued strong performance in the inland transportation sector and the addition of K-Sea Transportation, now Kirby Offshore Marine, in July 1 of last year resulted in our Marine Transportation revenues being 39% above and operating income 30% above the 2011 first quarter. The Marine segment’s first quarter operating margin was 20.4% compared with 21.8% for the first quarter of 2011.
As Greg noted, during the first quarter our Inland Marine Transportation sector’s 90% to 95% equipment utilization continued along with favorable pricing. Our legacy Marine Transportation sector maintained its strong operating margin in the mid 20% range during the first quarter.
Kirby Offshore Marine contributed approximately 20% of the first quarter’s Marine Transportation revenues, but with the $2.4 million severance charge, its contribution to our first quarter operating income was only slightly positive.
With the acquisition of United in the second quarter of 2011, our Diesel Engine Services revenues increased $231 million in the first quarter from $58 million a year ago and operating income was $23.6 million compared with $6.6 million in the first quarter of last year. The segment’s operating margin was 10.2% compared with 11.5% for the 2011 first quarter. United’s performance continued to be strong as they worked through their manufacturing backlog and ramped up service and remanufacturing. United’s operating margin was in the high single-digit range for the quarter.
We continued to generate significant cash during the first quarter with EBITDA of $125 million. Our capital spending for the first quarter was $62 million and consisted of $21 million for new inland tank barges and towboats, $19 million in progress payments on the 2 new offshore dry-bulk barge and tug units Greg mentioned and $22 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing inland and coastwise fleet.
Our capital spending guidance for 2012 is $265 to $275 million, and it includes $110 million for construction and new equipment and approximately $70 million in progress payments for the 2 offshore dry bulk units. The balance would be for upgrades to existing marine equipment and some to diesel engine service facilities. As of March 31, we had $72.5 million outstanding on our $250 million revolving credit facility.
Now I want to once again talk a little bit about the earn-out that we have in place for our acquisition of United Holdings. The former owners received $271 million on closing, but can receive an additional $50 million payable in 2014 if certain financial targets are met during 2011, 2012 and 2013. The fair value estimate of the amount we think we will have to pay under this agreement is determined each quarter and held as a contingent liability on our balance sheet. Any changes to the estimate we believe we will pay runs through the income statement. If we increase our estimate of the payout we would increase the contingent liability and it would lower our earnings. Conversely, if we lower the estimate we would reduce the liability and thereby increase our earnings.
During the first quarter we booked $4.2 million or $0.05 per share in expense as our estimate of the amount we would have to pay in this earn-out increased. As there are about 2 full years remaining for the earn-out period, you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustments, either up or down to the contingent liability. If consequently excluded any past or potential changes to the earn-out liability from our 2012 earnings guidance.
I’ll now turn the call back to Joe."

Our 2011 second quarter results included United purchased on April 15, 2011, but did not include Kirby Offshore Marine purchased on July 1, 2011. As David explained, our 2012 second quarter guidance is before any positive or negative change to United’s multi-year contingent earn-out liability. For the year our guidance remains at the $3.85 to $4.05 per share compared to actual earnings in 2011 of $3.33 per share.
As I stated at the beginning of the call, our Inland Marine Transportation business is performing at a very high level, with favorable pricing trends, and we anticipate this performance to continue. We have 50 new barges scheduled to be delivered throughout the balance of 2012. That will further enhance our inland performance as well as profitability. As we’ve stated since the purchase of our coastal fleet in July of 2011, the coastal market is not a next quarter story, but will improve over the next couple of years. We do expect the coastal fleet will be profitable with operating margins in the high single-digit area.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service business should improve going forward with increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
Perhaps the largest variable in our guidance is United and the impact of the recent transition away from drilling for natural gas to the exploration of crude oil, and the impact that this transition will have on new orders for equipment. We do anticipate a decrease in demand for new equipment, however, we believe this pause is providing an opportunity to free up some capacity for pressure pumping remanufacturing and will allow us to further developed and enhance that service model that really is our vision for the business when we bought it.

But we still have a pretty healthy backlog that we’re running with. When I say pause, I think that the market is just kind of stepping back and assessing what the transition from principally looking for gas to principally looking for oil really means for equipment demand. And you also have some logistics challenges as you move equipment that’s working in a particular area to another area. You have to get it there. You have to get the fracing material and some fluid there. You have to arrange for water. It’s a process that’s going to take a while to settle down.
What I think is different about this point in the oil service cycle is that typically when this happens, the whole sectors collapse. Energy prices have collapsed because traditionally natural gas and crude oil traded at a ratio that was driven more by the BTUs that each produced. Here you have a decoupling of natural gas and crude oil. So you don’t have a collapse, you just have a shift from based on price. The thing that we like to say here is that capitalism works: where you think you can make money, that’s where you go. You’re struggling to make money in the gas exploration area, the crude oil is priced so that you can make a lot of money in that area. And the world is trying to figure out how you get the equipment there and what it means when it gets there.
There’s a lot of talk about margins collapsing in that business. I think most businesses would love to have that kind of margin collapse. You’re going from extremely high operating margins to more traditional margins. So I’m not particularly concerned that there’s not going to be enthusiasm for doing this. You’re still making plenty of money. Just trying to re-assess what it all means."

We’re seeing some single skins being retired, so I think on the supply side of the market, it will gradually tighten up between now and the end of 2014.
On the demand side, the economy is weak. The coast wide business is largely refined products, which it’s vehicle miles driven, passenger miles flown, diesel truck miles driven and with the economy being weak, or on the weaker side of the last 5 years or so, that’s got to come back for you to see the demand side to come.

Our first quar",598,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning to everybody. Late yesterday afternoon we announced net earnings for the 2012 first quarter of $0.91 per share, reflecting a 52% improvement over the $0.60 per share reported for the same period last year. Our first quarter earnings guidance was $0.86 to $0.93 per share. In our first quarter results, there were 2 charges that were not included in our guidance range: a $4.2 million before tax charge, or $0.05 a share, which was the earn-out charge pertaining to the United acquisition; and a $2.4 million before tax, or $0.03 per share, severance charge associated with the integration of K-Sea into Kirby. David’s going to talk about both these charges in more detail later in the call.
Our record first quarter earnings were the result of a continued strong demand for our inland tank barge business, a strong performance from our land-based Diesel Engine Service business and improved earnings from our legacy Marine Diesel Engine Service business. Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was about as expected given the seasonality of this business and some continued overcapacity in the coastal tank barge fleet.
In April we changed the name of K-Sea Transportation to Kirby Offshore Marine, more fully integrating our coastal operation into the Kirby family of marine transportation companies. With this renaming, we have begun the process of rebranding equipment, the organization and the service. Jim Farley was named President of Kirby Offshore Marine, having previously served as the Executive Vice President of Operations for Kirby Inland Marine. David Grzebinski will serve as Kirby Offshore Marine’s Chairman as well as Kirby Corporation’s CFO. I look forward to working with both Jim and David as we more fully integrate Kirby Offshore Marine into our marine transportation business.
Our focus is to continue to enhance this service model with the objective of providing our customers the best and safest service in the industry.
Now our legacy inland tank barge business is performing well with favorable pricing trends. We anticipate this sector to remain positive based on the favorable outlook of the U.S. petrochemical and refining industry.
For the Diesel Engine segment, our legacy business is improving due to the overall health of its inland marine transportation customers and an improved Gulf of Mexico oil service market. For our land-based Diesel Engine Service business, with the current low price of natural gas incentive to drill for natural gas has declined but the incentive to find crude oil remains very positive due to the current high price of crude oil. This business is seeing a natural rotation away from natural gas to oil exploration. As this rotation occurs, there has been a pause in new orders for the oil service equipment as the market assesses its requirements. We are using this pause to further develop the service opportunities in this business.
When we purchased United it was our objective to apply a very good, well-tested marine diesel engine service model to land-based diesel engines. It is our intention to continue to build oil service equipment, but to more heavily focus on servicing this equipment rather than manufacturing it. Later in the call Greg will share with you some encouraging comments regarding remanufacturing service opportunities. Then I’ll come back at the end of the call and talk about the second quarter as well as the full year outlook.
Now I’m going to turn the call over to David, who will speak briefly about Kirby Offshore Marine’s markets and then Greg will update you on our inland tank barge business and the Diesel Engine Service markets."

As we have mentioned before, the fourth and first quarters are more difficult for our coastal operation due to seasonality. The",390,"Kirby Offshore Marine’s operating results, including the severance charge, were a bit above breakeven for the first quarter. As we have mentioned before, the fourth and first quarters are more difficult for our coastal operation due to seasonality. The closure or a significant reduction in demand in Alaska and on the Great Lakes, as well as poor operating efficiency caused by winter weather conditions. Also during the first quarter, unseasonably mild weather in New York and the Northeast market negatively impacted demand for distillate products, particularly heating oil, which resulted in lower equipment utilization and rates in the New York and Northeast market.
As Joe mentioned, in the 2012 first quarter we took a $2.4 million or $0.03 per share charge related to severance which was for the integration of Kirby Offshore Marine’s administrative functions into Kirby. We have made the decisions and taken the steps, some of them painful from a personnel standpoint, to fully integrate Kirby Offshore Marine into the Kirby Marine family. As part of this integration, we will be closing our East Brunswick New Jersey office and consolidating our East Coast operations into our existing Staten Island, New York operations facility.
For the first quarter Kirby Offshore Marine’s equipment utilization rate was in the 75% to 80% range. With respect to pricing, contracts that renewed during the first quarter and spot contracts were basically flat. Approximately 60% of Kirby Offshore Marine’s revenues were under term contract and 40% were spot. Time charters represented approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts during the quarter.
As we have stated before, our coastal operations primarily transport refined products, tying it more to the U.S. economy, which is a contrast to our inland fleet, which is seeing strong leverage from the chemical market. Offshore marine equipment utilization levels in pricing are weaker than in our inland transportation business. As we continue to fine tune our coastal operations, reduce costs and seek additional coastal transportation opportunities with our existing inland marine customers, our profitability will improve. Furthermore, as the U.S. economy improves and the industry’s single hold tank barges, which currently comprise approximately 8% of the coastwise capacity, when those are removed from service between now and the end of 2014, we fully expect coastal utilization and rates to improve.
I will now turn the call over to Greg."

The U.S. produced Petrochemicals for both domestic consumption and exportation remains strong, as U.S.-produced low price natural gas continues to provide a feed stock advantage, thereby continuing the global competitiveness of the U.S. Petrochemical industry.
Kirby’s black oil fleet continued to see strong demand, driven by a stable refinery output and the movement of crude oil from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast and from South Texas. Our refined products demand remained positive, benefiting from Midwest to Gulf Coast movements of ethanol. In the agricultural chemical market the traditional spring fill started early, transporting both domestically produced and imported products. This has been driven by warmer than normal weather and low fertilizer inventories coupled with high corn prices.
Our petrochemical and black oil inland fleets operated at utilization levels in the low to mid 90% range during the first quarter. Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75%, and the mix of time charter and affreightment business continued at about 55% and 45% respectively.
Turning to the inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts that renewed during the first quarter continued to be renewed in the range of mid single-digit levels, in some cases were slightly higher when compared with the same period during 2011. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rates increase modestly when compared sequentially to the 2011 fourth quarter. Our multi-year contracts have annual increases based on labor in the producer price index and some of these are adjusted each January and the adjustments to this year, which were effective January 1, provided rate increases in the 2% range.
During the 2012 first quarter we continued to invest in our inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges, thereby reducing maintenance costs and out of service days and improving the reliability of the fleet and our customer service. We took delivery of five new 30,000 barrel tank barges totaling approximately 140,000 barrels of capacity and retired 16 tank barges and returned 2 charter barges, thereby reducing capacity by approximately 300,000 barrels.
So net-net during the 2012 first quarter, our inland tank barge fleet declined by 13 tank barges and our capacity decreased by approximately 160,000 barrels. As of May 31st, we operated 806 tank barges with a capacity of 16 million barrels. During the quarter we also took delivery of one 2,000 horsepower inland towboat.
For the remaining 9 months of 2012, our construction program will consist of 20 new 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 30 new 10,000 barrel tank barges with the total capacity of approximately 875,000 barrels. We will also take delivery of 4 new additional canal towboats.
The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats remaining in our construction program is approximately $90 million, the majority of which will be expended during 2012. We will also continue to retire older barges during 2012. At the present time we anticipate that our 2012 year-end capacity to be approximately 16.5 million barrels, or about 300,000 barrels above the 16.2 million barrels that we had at the beginning of the year.
In the 2012 fourth quarter we will also take delivery of 2 new offshore articulated dry-bulk tug barge units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 we made progress payments on these 2 units totaling approximately $52 million and the balance will be paid through the remaining 9 months of 2012.
Turning to our Diesel Engine Service segment. United, our land-based drilling service provider, contributed about 75% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue during the first quarter. Their operating margin was in the high single digits. The quarter benefited from the startup of remanufacturing hydraulic fracturing equipment.
We’re making good progress towards our stated objective of moving United to a business which is focused on the more stable service business. This will be accomplished by increasing our business levels in remanufacturing and to a lesser extent the parts and service and distribution business so that reman and service is the majority of what we do.
Let me express this in terms of revenue. In 2011 approximately 55% of United’s revenue was from manufacturing. Primarily the assembly of oil field service equipment. For 2012 we are forecasting that this will reverse. In about 55% to 60% of United’s revenue will be from re-manufacturing parts and service as we anticipate that the demand for reman will continue to increase as manufacturing slows later in the year.
Currently we have 27 units either in the process of being re-manufactured or in the queue to start, with commitments from our customers to send more units as capacity becomes available at our reman facility. Our vision for United is that the reman and service business forms a stable base on top of which we can layer in manufacturing business activity as the market presents the opportunity to do so.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Services segment marine market reported higher results benefiting from large overhaul projects for both domestic and international marine customers as well as the return of drilling rigs to the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. The legacy Power Generation business benefited from engine generator setup grades, service and part sales.
I will now turn the call back over to David."

Our continued strong performance in the inland transportation sector and the addition of K-Sea Transportation, now Kirby Offshore Marine, in July 1 of last year resulted in our Marine Transportation",592,"Let me provide a few financial details for the quarter. Our continued strong performance in the inland transportation sector and the addition of K-Sea Transportation, now Kirby Offshore Marine, in July 1 of last year resulted in our Marine Transportation revenues being 39% above and operating income 30% above the 2011 first quarter. The Marine segment’s first quarter operating margin was 20.4% compared with 21.8% for the first quarter of 2011.
As Greg noted, during the first quarter our Inland Marine Transportation sector’s 90% to 95% equipment utilization continued along with favorable pricing. Our legacy Marine Transportation sector maintained its strong operating margin in the mid 20% range during the first quarter.
Kirby Offshore Marine contributed approximately 20% of the first quarter’s Marine Transportation revenues, but with the $2.4 million severance charge, its contribution to our first quarter operating income was only slightly positive.
With the acquisition of United in the second quarter of 2011, our Diesel Engine Services revenues increased $231 million in the first quarter from $58 million a year ago and operating income was $23.6 million compared with $6.6 million in the first quarter of last year. The segment’s operating margin was 10.2% compared with 11.5% for the 2011 first quarter. United’s performance continued to be strong as they worked through their manufacturing backlog and ramped up service and remanufacturing. United’s operating margin was in the high single-digit range for the quarter.
We continued to generate significant cash during the first quarter with EBITDA of $125 million. Our capital spending for the first quarter was $62 million and consisted of $21 million for new inland tank barges and towboats, $19 million in progress payments on the 2 new offshore dry-bulk barge and tug units Greg mentioned and $22 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing inland and coastwise fleet.
Our capital spending guidance for 2012 is $265 to $275 million, and it includes $110 million for construction and new equipment and approximately $70 million in progress payments for the 2 offshore dry bulk units. The balance would be for upgrades to existing marine equipment and some to diesel engine service facilities. As of March 31, we had $72.5 million outstanding on our $250 million revolving credit facility.
Now I want to once again talk a little bit about the earn-out that we have in place for our acquisition of United Holdings. The former owners received $271 million on closing, but can receive an additional $50 million payable in 2014 if certain financial targets are met during 2011, 2012 and 2013. The fair value estimate of the amount we think we will have to pay under this agreement is determined each quarter and held as a contingent liability on our balance sheet. Any changes to the estimate we believe we will pay runs through the income statement. If we increase our estimate of the payout we would increase the contingent liability and it would lower our earnings. Conversely, if we lower the estimate we would reduce the liability and thereby increase our earnings.
During the first quarter we booked $4.2 million or $0.05 per share in expense as our estimate of the amount we would have to pay in this earn-out increased. As there are about 2 full years remaining for the earn-out period, you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustments, either up or down to the contingent liability. If consequently excluded any past or potential changes to the earn-out liability from our 2012 earnings guidance.
I’ll now turn the call back to Joe."

This compares with $0.77 per share earned in the 2011 second quarter. Our 2011 second quarter results included United purchased on April 15, 2011, but did not include Kirby Offshore Marine purchased on July 1, 2011. As David explained, our 2012 second quarter guidance is before any positive or negative change to United’s multi-year contingent earn-out liability. For the year our guidance remains at the $3.85 to $4.05 per share compared to actual earnings in 2011 of $3.33 per share.
As I stated at the beginning of the call, our Inland Marine Transportation business is performing at a very high level, with favorable pricing trends, and we anticipate this performance to continue. We have 50 new barges scheduled to be delivered throughout the balance of 2012. That will further enhance our inland performance as well as profitability. As we’ve stated since the purchase of our coastal fleet in July of 2011, the coastal market is not a next quarter story, but will improve over the next couple of years. We do expect the coastal fleet will be profitable with operating margins in the high single-digit area.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service business should improve going forward with increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
Perhaps the largest variable in our guidance is United and the impact of the recent transition away from drilling for natural gas to the exploration of crude oil, and the impact that this transition will have on new orders for equipment. We do anticipate a decrease in demand for new equipment, however, we believe this pause is providing an opportunity to free up some capacity for pressure pumping remanufacturing and will allow us to further developed and enhance that service model that really is our vision for the business when we bought it.

But we still have a pretty healthy backlog that we’re running with. When I say pause, I think that the market is just kind of stepping back and assessing what the transition from principally looking for gas to principally looking for oil really means for equipment demand. And you also have some logistics challenges as you move equipment that’s working in a particular area to another area. You have to get it there. You have to get the fracing material and some fluid there. You have to arrange for water. It’s a process that’s going to take a while to settle down.
What I think is different about this point in the oil service cycle is that typically when this happens, the whole sectors collapse. Energy prices have collapsed because traditionally natural gas and crude oil traded at a ratio that was driven more by the BTUs that each produced. Here you have a decoupling of natural gas and crude oil. So you don’t have a collapse, you just have a shift from based on price. The thing that we like to say here is that capitalism works: where you think you can make money, that’s where you go. You’re struggling to make money in the gas exploration area, the crude oil is priced so that you can make a lot of money in that area. And the world is trying to figure out how you get the equipment there and what it means when it gets there.
There’s a lot of talk about margins collapsing in that business. I think most businesses would love to have that kind of margin collapse. You’re going from extremely high operating margins to more traditional margins. So I’m not particularly concerned that there’s not going to be enthusiasm for doing this. You’re still making plenty of money. Just trying to re-assess what it all means."

That’s going to be moved principally in larger vessels than we operate.

Very good. One of the railroads talked earlier this week when they announced earnings that they were having difficulty signing longer term contracts for crude by rail movements to justify building additional storage facilities and the like in South Texas. Are you seeing that maybe Kirby is running into more opportunities to move crude, either down the Mississippi or out of the Eagle Ford at the expense of the rails because your model may be a little bit more flexible, a little bit more able to handle things on a spot basis?

Where the rail play is, is out of Cushing and out of Bakken. There is some talk about moving Bakken crude to St. Louis where it would be put on barge. I think with respect to the Eagle Ford, what we’ve said about barging volumes out of the Eagle Ford is that right now you don’t have a good pipeline gathering system. They are putting in pipelines and we think that there’s always going to be barging but at some point the amount of new equipment that you’re going to put in there is going to be capped. That the excess crude oil is going to be moved by pipeline.
My guess is what you’re hearing with respect to the railroads is more what’s happening with Cushing because there’s pipelines that are planned and talked about at Cushing and also pipelines that are being put in at the Bakken. And there’s resistance to long-term agreement with railroads until you really understand what those pipelines do.
I’m guessing there. But my guess is that’s more the discussion than an Eagle Ford or Canadian crew out of the St. Louis area."

Our second quarter earnings of $0.85 per share came in at the high end of our revised $0.80 to $0.85 per share guidance range. With respect to our Inland Tank Barge business it continued to perform well and operating results were above the 2011 second quarter results despite some temporarily lower petrochemical volumes from one major customer principally due to plant maintenance outages as well as low water levels on the Mississippi river which led to light loading tank barges since mid-May and throughout June.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service Marine business operating results were also above the 2011 second quarter results principally due to improvements in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market. Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was about as expected except for the New York Harbor market which was a little softer. Higher maintenance and repair related issues and lower revenues caused by delays, plants and shipyards addressing this maintenance negatively impacted the second quarter.
For our land-based diesel engine service market with the current low price of natural gas the incentive to drill for natural gas has been sharply curtailed. But the incentive to find crude oil remains positive. As a result orders for manufacturing frac spreads have been curtailed but demand for remanufacturing existing equipment has improved. I’ll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about the third quarter and the full year outlook. I’m now going to turn the call over to Greg Binion who will discuss our Inland Tank Barge and Diesel Engine Service markets.

For the second quarter our Inland Marine Transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% and 95% range and higher term in spot contract pricing. In mid-May",981,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to all. For the second quarter our Inland Marine Transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% and 95% range and higher term in spot contract pricing. In mid-May we started to experience low water conditions on the Mississippi river system and reduced operating drafts. Those conditions persist today.
During the second quarter we also were affected by some scheduled and unscheduled maintenance at a major Petrochemicals customer facilities. These facilities are now back in service. Black oil demand remains strong driven by continued stable refinery output and the continued exportation of heavy fuel oil. Also the movement of crude oil along both the river and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway continues to be brisk. I’d also note that we did load our first Balken crude cargo out of St. Louis over the weekend. Refined product demand remains positive benefiting from additional volumes from major customers. In our Agricultural Chemicals demand driven by low inventory levels and high corn prices remains strong in April and May but it declined sharply in June as expected.
Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and the freightment business continue to be about 55% and 45% respectively.
Turning to the Inland Marine Transportation pricing, term contracts during the second quarter continue to be renewed in the mid-single digit level with some cases slightly higher pricing when compared to the 2011 second quarter. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel saw rates increase modestly when compared to the 2012 first quarter. We continue to invest in our Inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading existing barges. This reduces maintenance cost and out of service days and improves the reliability of the fleet and our customer service.
During the 2012 first six months we took delivery of 20 new 30,000-barrel tank barges and eight new 10,000-barrel tank barges totaling approximately 650,000 barrels of capacity. We retired 27 tank barges and returned three chartered tank barges, reducing capacity by about 470,000 barrels. So net, net during the 2012 first six months our inland tank barge fleet decreased by one but our capacity increased by approximately 180,000 barrels.
As of June 30 we operated 818 tank barges with a capacity of 16.4 million barrels. We also took delivery of two 2,000-horsepower inland towboats in the 2012 second half. In May of 2012 we signed contracts for the construction of 36 new 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and 20 new 10,000-barrel tank barges all totaling approximately 1.2 million barrels of capacity.
Three of the 30,000-barrel tank barges are currently planned for delivery in late 2012 and the balance of these barges will be delivered throughout 2013. At the present time many of these new tank barges are anticipated to be replacements for older barges removed from service.
For the second half of 2012 our construction program will consist of eight new 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and 22 10,000-barrel inland tank barges with a total capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. We will also take delivery of three additional canal towboats. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats during 2012 and progress payments made on barges and towboats delivered in 2013 will be about $130 million.
We also continue to retire older barges during the 2012 second half, and at the present time we anticipate that our 2012 year-end capacity will be approximately 16.5 million barrels or 350,000 barrels above the 16.2 million that we had at the beginning of the year.
In the 2012 fourth quarter we will take delivery of two new offshore dry bulk barge tug units for the use under long-term contracts. The cost is about $52 million for each of these units. During 2011 and the first half of 2012 we made progress payments on these units totaling approximately $65 million, and the balance will be paid during the 2012 second half.
Turning to our Diesel Engine Service segment. United, a land-based service provider as anticipated saw revenues and operating income decline, the result of order cancellation and postponement for the manufacturing of fracturing units, as well as modest declines in the service of land-based diesel engines and the sale of engines, transmissions and parts, all associated with the low price of natural gas and resulting declines in drilling for natural gas in the North American shale formations.
Partially offsetting the decline in manufacturing of fracturing units was the demand for remanufacturing of such units. However, it will take us several quarters for United to obtain its optimal efficiency level for the process of remanufacturing these units. Currently United has 29 units in its facilities either in the process of being remanufactured or in the queue to start the process with commitments from our customers to send more units to be remanufactured as capacity becomes available in a reman facility.
We said since we announced the acquisition of United that our vision was to move the majority of United’s business to service, including the reman of all service equipment along with parts and distribution as a means to establish a more stable revenue and earnings stream while preserving the ability to layer in manufacturing as the market present the opportunity to do so. We are on the path towards achieving this business model.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service Marine business reported higher operating results benefiting from an improved oil service activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico as well as from international customers. Business was also brisk for major overhauls and gear work for inland tank barge and dry cargo operators as well as coastal operators. The power gen market benefited from strong part sales and continued favorable engine generator set-up grades during the second quarter.
I’ll now turn the call over to David.

Overall equipment utilization was in the 75% range for Kirby Offshore Marine. The Pacific, Alaska and Hawaiian markets reported higher utilization levels, however the New York market, the New York Harbor market in particular, saw lower equipment utilization levels and corresponding competitive bidding for available movements.
During the second quarter we had an additional $500,000 in severance charges associated with the integration of Kirby Offshore Marine into Kirby. We had the negative impact of maintenance and repair-related equipment unavailability issues that negatively impacted results as well. We continued - with continued low equipment utilization and excess capacity in the New York Harbor market during the second quarter, we did reposition four tank barges and two tugboats to the Gulf Coast market; and the repositioning costs for these moves were included in our second quarter results.
With respect to pricing, contracts that renewed for Kirby Offshore Marine during the quarter and spot-contract rates were basically flat. Approximately 60% of Kirby Offshore Marine’s revenues were under term contracts with 40% being spot contracts. Time charter is represented approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts during the second quarter.
Moving to Kirby general financial data, late yesterday as you know we announced net earnings for the second quarter of $0.85 per share compared with $0.77 per share from the second quarter last year. For comparison purposes, the 2011 second quarter results included about $0.07 negative impact from the record-setting high water and flood conditions we had last year.
A continued strong perform in our Inland Transportation sector and the acquisition of Kirby Offshore Marine, which was effective July 1 of last year, resulted with our Marine Transportation segment revenues being 28% above and operating income 23% above the 2011 second quarter. The Marine Transportation segment second quarter operating margin was 21% compared to 21.9% from last year. As Greg noted, during the second quarter our inland-marine transportation fleets 90% to 95% equipment utilization continued along with favorable pricing.
The Inland sector contributed about 80% of the second quarter’s Marine Transportation segment revenue. We estimate that the low water levels on the Mississippi River and the maintenance issues at a major petrochemical customer’s facilities negatively impacted the second quarter by about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Despite these temporary negative issues, our Inland Marine operations maintained an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the second quarter.
Kirby Offshore Marine contributed about 20% of the second quarter’s Marine Transportation revenues. With the maintenance and repair-related issues negatively impacting earnings and an additional $500,000 severance charge coupled with the weak New York harbor market and the re-positioning costs, the operating margin at Kirby Offshore Marine was in the low single-digit range.
Our Diesel Engine Services revenue for the 2012 second quarter was in line with 2011 second quarter, which both periods included United. However, last year United acquisition was completed on April 15.
Diesel Engine Services operating margin - operating income was 14% lower than the 2011 second quarter and the second - and the segment’s operating margin was 8.9% compared with 10.3% for the second quarter last year. The decline in operating margin and operating income was due to the lower results from United, that Greg noted. United contributed approximately 70% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue during the second quarter.
With the decline in manufacturing revenue, specifically fracturing units, and replaced to some degree with remanufacturing of fracturing units, United earned an operating margin in the mid- to high-single digit range for the second quarter. The legacy marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 30% of Diesel Engine Services revenue during the second quarter and they benefited from improved Gulf Coast offshore service market and some large overhaul projects for the inland and coastal marine customers that they have.
We continue to generate significant cash during the first just of 2012, with EBITDA of $243 million. Our capital spending for the first half was $154 million and consisted of $70 million for new inland tank barges and tow boats, $32 million for progress payments on the two new offshore dry bulk barge and tug units and $52 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing inland and coastal fleet, as well as some spending on the Diesel Engine Services facilities.
We have raised our capital spending guidance for 2012 to $290 million to $300 million range, including $130 million for construction of new inland equipment, approximately $70 million in progress payments for the two offshore dry bulk units, with the balance attributable to upgrades for the inland and coastal fleets, as well as some progress payments on - for the inland tank barges ordered in 2012 for late 2012 and 2013 deliveries.
As of June 30, we had $106 million outstanding on our $250 million revolving credit facility, and as of this morning, our revolver’s outstanding balance was $91 million. With respect to United earn-out, during the fourth quarter of 2012, based on United’s earnings, we booked $4.2 million or $0.05 per share in expense as our estimate of the earn-out increased. During this second quarter, with the decline in natural gas prices and the subsequent weaker market for manufacturing of fracturing units, we held the contingent liability flat making only a slight adjustment to reflect the time value of money. As of June 30, we have recorded an earn-out liability of $26.9 million. As there are 18 months remaining for the earn-out period, you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustments, either up or down to this contingent liability. We have consequently excluded any future changes to the earn-out contingent liability from our guidance.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Joe.

Yesterday afternoon we announced our guidance for the third quarter of $0.87 to $0.97 per share. This compares with $0.94 per share earned in the 2011 third quarter. The 2012 and 2011 third quarters are a direct comparison as the third quarter last year results included United purchased on April 15, 2011 as well as Kirby Offshore Marine, which was purchased July 1, 2011. For the year our guidance is $3.50 to $3.70 per share compared to the 2011 results of $3.33 per share.
As we stated earlier, our Inland Marine Transportation sector is doing well, favorable pricing trends and we anticipate that this is going to continue throughout the rest of this year and into next year. As I’m sure you’re aware, draught conditions in the Midwest have created low water conditions on the Illinois, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. These low water conditions negatively impacted our second quarter as well as reducing drafts on our barges with destinations to up-river locations since about mid-May.
That continues as we speak today and our third quarter guidance assumes that the water levels on this system will remain similar to where they are today. We cannot predict rainfall in the Midwest any better than we can predict potential hurricanes, therefore we based our guidance on current weather conditions and water levels going forward, although we are beginning to see some rain in the Midwest, which is encouraging.
Our third quarter guidance assumes our Coastal Marine Transportation business results should improve due to the seasonality of the refined products market as well as favorable operating conditions during the quarter. Since we purchased our coastal fleet in July of 2011, we have said the Coastal market is not a next quarter or 2012 story but operating results should improve over the next couple of years as supply and demand becomes more balanced, leading to higher equipment utilization. And maintenance and repair expenditures should decline as we bring this fleet up to what we think are appropriate equipment standards.
Our maintenance strategy will improve this fleet’s performance as well as its profitability, and our long-term strategy for this business remains intact. Our guidance assumes our legacy Diesel Engine Service business will be similar to the second quarter results, reflecting continued good marine and power generation markets. A more significant variable in the third quarter and the year guidance is United, with the decline of natural gas prices and its impact on manufacturing and remanufacturing pressure pumping equipment and service to the land-based oil and gas market.
Even with this volatility, however, United remains profitable. Its performance is consistent with our original acquisition pro forma and our initiative of focusing this business on the service side of the business will take out some of the future volatility.
Operator, we’re now ready to open the call up for questions.

There’s a lot of crude oil coming out of Eagle Ford which is South Texas. And that’s being moved by inland barge and in some instances coastal barge. There’s also a gathering pipeline systems that are being installed in that market. And what we have said in the past is that we think that, that barge demand at some point is going to be capped. We don’t think it’s going to go away, but we don’t think there’s going to be a lot of future growth coming out of South Texas.
Now having said that the need to supply crude oil to east coast refineries is significant. That’s going to be moved in larger vessels, these are the, you know typically ships in the 340,000 barrel range. KC’s biggest barge is 185,000. That lends itself more to the refine products trade than actually moving crude oil. Where we do think there’s some offshore opportunity is the movement of some crude oil but also a lot of the condensate that’s coming out Eagle Ford to refineries that can use it by offshore equipment. And that movement really is much better suited for barges that are in the KC range.
How the east coast gets their crude oil is stills somewhat of a mystery. There’s talk of bulk and crude coming into Albany by train. Some of that’s happening today. We should have an opportunity to move some of that. I think we’ve already moved some of it. You of course have the imported crude, which is expensive relative to U.S.-crude-based pricing. But I’m not sure that, that’s all been worked out yet. You guys have anything to add to that?

I think that in our contracts we do have low-water protection and we have minimum volume protection in most of the contracts. Where you may yet to be affected is if it continues to shoal, you’re going to see delays caused by dredging and you’re going to see some high-velocity currents as the river narrows.

The industry is building a number of barges this year. We think that it’s driven by the tax benefits you get this year that you’re not going to get next year. Capacity additions are something that you watch closely. But as we look at the capacity that’s coming in the current fleet utilization and the growth in our markets, we’re really not that concerned about it for a couple of years.
Where you get concerned about it is that if this building continued and you had a market issue where your volumes dropped. Then you could go into an overcapacity situation pretty quickly. I think that they way the industry is building you’re not going to see sharp drops in utilization without an effect on volume. And if utilization stays in the 90% range, you should continue to have some pricing power. If it begins to drop then you’d worry about it. And 2013, specific to your question about Kirby’s fleet, we could add about 300,000 barrels. Is that right? 300,000 barrel of additional capacity. And I would tell you that in our building plans, that’s kind of our intent. But if we got worried about utilization then we would pre-empt some replacement and just keep the fleet flat.

But yeah, clearly it’s a supply and demand situation. A lot of refined products are moved Coastwise and that demand is down because of the general economic weakness and so the market’s a little oversupplied.
As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, it - we knew it wasn’t a one quarter story, this is going to take some time to tighten up. There are approximately 40 to 45 coastal barges that are 185,000 barrels or less that are over 25 years old, so sooner or later that equipment’s going to come out and pricing, the market doesn’t justify building any new equipment right now.

As Joe talked about, the timeline to make that world scale addition happen is out in the future pretty far, four to five years from here. But you know the good news is, is that the U.S. Gulf Coast and North America in general is becoming a place of preferred venue for investment for the Petrochemical players as it has been for some time for the refiners. We’ve seen quite a bit of investment in the refining complex down on the Gulf Coast making it one of the most efficient and flexible ones in the world.

Our second quarter earnings of $0.85 per share came in at the high end of our revised $0.80 to $0.85 per share guidance range. With respect to our Inland Tank Barge business it continued to perform well and operating results were above the 2011 second quarter results, despite some temporarily lower petrochemical volumes from one major customer principally due to plant maintenance outages as well as low water levels on the Mississippi river which led to light loading tank barges since mid-May and throughout June.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service Marine business operating results were also above the 2011 second quarter results principally due to improvements in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market. Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was about as expected except for the New York Harbor market which was a little softer. Higher maintenance and repair related issues and lower revenues caused by delays, plants and shipyards addressing this maintenance negatively impacted the second quarter.
For our land-based diesel engine service market with the current low price of natural gas, the incentive to drill for natural gas has been sharply curtailed. But the incentive to find crude oil remains positive. As a result, orders for manufacturing frac spreads have been curtailed but demand for remanufacturing existing equipment has improved. I’ll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about the third quarter and the full year outlook. I’m now going to turn the call over to Greg Binion who will discuss our Inland Tank Barge and Diesel Engine Service markets.

For the second quarter, our Inland Marine Transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range and higher term in spot contract pricing. In mid-May",982,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to all. For the second quarter, our Inland Marine Transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range and higher term in spot contract pricing. In mid-May we started to experience low water conditions on the Mississippi river system and reduced operating drafts. Those conditions persist today.
During the second quarter, we also were affected by some scheduled and unscheduled maintenance at a major Petrochemicals customer facilities. These facilities are now back in service. Black oil demand remains strong driven by continued stable refinery output and the continued exportation of heavy fuel oil. Also the movement of crude oil along both the river and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway continues to be brisk. I’d also note that we did load our first Balken crude cargo out of St. Louis over the weekend. Refined product demand remains positive, benefiting from additional volumes from major customers. In our Agricultural Chemicals demand, driven by low inventory levels and high corn prices, remains strong in April and May but it declined sharply in June as expected.
Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and the freightment business continued to be about 55% and 45% respectively.
Turning to the Inland Marine Transportation pricing, term contracts during the second quarter continued to be renewed in the mid-single digit level with some cases slightly higher pricing when compared to the 2011 second quarter. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rates increase modestly when compared to the 2012 first quarter. We continue to invest in our Inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading existing barges. This reduces maintenance cost and out of service days and improves the reliability of the fleet and our customer service.
During the 2012 first six months, we took delivery of 20 new 30,000-barrel tank barges and eight new 10,000-barrel tank barges totaling approximately 650,000 barrels of capacity. We retired 27 tank barges and returned three chartered tank barges, reducing capacity by about 470,000 barrels. So net, net during the 2012 first six months our inland tank barge fleet decreased by one but our capacity increased by approximately 180,000 barrels.
As of June 30 we operated 818 tank barges with a capacity of 16.4 million barrels. We also took delivery of two 2,000-horsepower inland towboats in the 2012 second half. In May of 2012 we signed contracts for the construction of 36 new 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and 20 new 10,000-barrel tank barges all totaling approximately 1.2 million barrels of capacity.
Three of the 30,000-barrel tank barges are currently planned for delivery in late 2012 and the balance of these barges will be delivered throughout 2013. At the present time many of these new tank barges are anticipated to be replacements for older barges removed from service.
For the second half of 2012 our construction program will consist of eight new 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and 22 10,000-barrel inland tank barges with a total capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. We will also take delivery of three additional canal towboats. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats during 2012 and progress payments made on barges and towboats delivered in 2013 will be about $130 million.
We also continue to retire older barges during the 2012 second half, and at the present time we anticipate that our 2012 year-end capacity will be approximately 16.5 million barrels or 350,000 barrels above the 16.2 million that we had at the beginning of the year.
In the 2012 fourth quarter we will take delivery of two new offshore dry bulk barge tug units for the use of under long-term contracts. The cost is about $52 million for each of these units. During 2011 and the first half of 2012 we made progress payments on these units totaling approximately $65 million, and the balance will be paid during the 2012 second half.
Turning to our Diesel Engine Service segment. United, a land-based service provider, as anticipated, saw revenues and operating income decline, the result of order cancellation and postponement for the manufacturing of fracturing units, as well as modest declines in the service of land-based diesel engines and the sale of engines, transmissions and parts, all associated with the low price of natural gas and resulting declines in drilling for natural gas in the North American shale formations.
Partially offsetting the decline in manufacturing of fracturing units was the demand for remanufacturing of such units. However, it will take us several quarters for United to obtain its optimal efficiency level for the process of remanufacturing these units. Currently United has 29 units in its facilities either in the process of being remanufactured or in the queue to start the process with commitments from our customers to send more units to be remanufactured as capacity becomes available in a reman facility.
We said since we announced the acquisition of United that our vision was to move the majority of United’s business to service, including the reman of all service equipment along with parts and distribution as a means to establish a more stable revenue and earnings stream while preserving the ability to layer in manufacturing as the market presents the opportunity to do so. We are on the path towards achieving this business model.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service Marine business reported higher operating results, benefiting from an improved oil service activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico as well as from international customers. Business was also brisk for major overhauls and gear work for inland tank barge and dry cargo operators as well as coastal operators. The power gen market benefited from strong part sales and continued favorable engine generator set-up grades during the second quarter.
I’ll now turn the call over to David."

Let me start with Kirby Offshore Marine. Overall equipment utilization was in the 75% range for Kirby Offshore Marine.

Overall equipment utilization was in the 75% range for Kirby Offshore Marine. The Pacific, Alaska and Hawaiian markets reported higher utilization levels, however the New York market, the New York Harbor market in particular, saw lower equipment utilization levels and corresponding competitive bidding for available movements.
During the second quarter we had an additional $500,000 in severance charges associated with the integration of Kirby Offshore Marine into Kirby. We had the negative impact of maintenance and repair-related equipment unavailability issues that negatively impacted results as well. We continued - with continued low equipment utilization and excess capacity in the New York Harbor market during the second quarter, we did reposition four tank barges and two tugboats to the Gulf Coast market; and the repositioning costs for these moves were included in our second quarter results.
With respect to pricing, contracts that renewed for Kirby Offshore Marine during the quarter and spot-contract rates were basically flat. Approximately 60% of Kirby Offshore Marine’s revenues were under term contracts with 40% being spot contracts. Time charters represented approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts during the second quarter.
Moving to Kirby general financial data, late yesterday, as you know, we announced net earnings for the second quarter of $0.85 per share compared with $0.77 per share from the second quarter last year. For comparison purposes, the 2011 second quarter results included about $0.07 negative impact from the record-setting high water and flood conditions we had last year.
A continued strong perform in our Inland Transportation sector and the acquisition of Kirby Offshore Marine, which was effective July 1 of last year, resulted with our Marine Transportation segment revenues being 28% above and operating income 23% above the 2011 second quarter. The Marine Transportation segment second quarter operating margin was 21% compared to 21.9% from last year. As Greg noted, during the second quarter, our inland-marine transportation fleets 90% to 95% equipment utilization continued along with favorable pricing.
The Inland sector contributed about 80% of the second quarter’s Marine Transportation segment revenue. We estimate that the low water levels on the Mississippi River and the maintenance issues at a major petrochemical customer’s facilities negatively impacted the second quarter by about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Despite these temporary negative issues, our Inland Marine operations maintained an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the second quarter.
Kirby Offshore Marine contributed about 20% of the second quarter’s Marine Transportation revenues. With the maintenance and repair-related issues negatively impacting earnings and an additional $500,000 severance charge coupled with the weak New York harbor market and the re-positioning costs, the operating margin at Kirby Offshore Marine was in the low single-digit range.
Our Diesel Engine Services revenue for the 2012 second quarter was in line with 2011 second quarter, which both periods included United. However, last year United acquisition was completed on April 15.
Diesel Engine Services operating margin - operating income was 14% lower than the 2011 second quarter and the second - and the segment’s operating margin was 8.9% compared with 10.3% for the second quarter last year. The decline in operating margin and operating income was due to the lower results from United, that Greg noted. United contributed approximately 70% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue during the second quarter.
With the decline in manufacturing revenue, specifically fracturing units, and replaced to some degree with remanufacturing of fracturing units, United earned an operating margin in the mid- to high-single digit range for the second quarter. The legacy marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 30% of Diesel Engine Services revenue during the second quarter and they benefited from improved Gulf Coast offshore service market and some large overhaul projects for the inland and coastal marine customers that they have.
We continued to generate significant cash during the first just of 2012, with EBITDA of $243 million. Our capital spending for the first half was $154 million and consisted of $70 million for new inland tank barges and tow boats, $32 million for progress payments on the two new offshore dry bulk barge and tug units and $52 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing inland and coastal fleet, as well as some spending on the Diesel Engine Services facilities.
We have raised our capital spending guidance for 2012 to $290 million to $300 million range, including $130 million for construction of new inland equipment, approximately $70 million in progress payments for the two offshore dry bulk units, with the balance attributable to upgrades for the inland and coastal fleets, as well as some progress payments on - for the inland tank barges ordered in 2012 for late 2012 and 2013 deliveries.
As of June 30, we had $106 million outstanding on our $250 million revolving credit facility, and as of this morning, our revolver’s outstanding balance was $91 million. With respect to the United earn-out, during the first quarter of 2012, based on United’s earnings, we booked $4.2 million or $0.05 per share in expense as our estimate of the earn-out increased. During this second quarter, with the decline in natural gas prices and the subsequent weaker market for manufacturing of fracturing units, we held the contingent liability flat making only a slight adjustment to reflect the time value of money. As of June 30, we have recorded an earn-out liability of $26.9 million. As there are 18 months remaining for the earn-out period, you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustments, either up or down to this contingent liability. We have consequently excluded any future changes to the earn-out contingent liability from our guidance.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Joe."

This compares with $0.94 per share earned in the 2011 third quarter. T",487,"Okay. Thank you. Thank you, David. I’m going to talk about the outlook going forward. Yesterday afternoon we announced our guidance for the third quarter of $0.87 to $0.97 per share. This compares with $0.94 per share earned in the 2011 third quarter. The 2012 and 2011 third quarters are a direct comparison as the third quarter last year results included United purchased on April 15, 2011 as well as Kirby Offshore Marine, which was purchased July 1, 2011. For the year, our guidance is $3.50 to $3.70 per share compared to the 2011 results of $3.33 per share.
As we stated earlier, our Inland Marine Transportation sector is doing well, favorable pricing trends and we anticipate that this is going to continue throughout the rest of this year and into next year. As I’m sure you’re aware, draught conditions in the Midwest have created low water conditions on the Illinois, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. These low water conditions negatively impacted our second quarter as well as reducing drafts on our barges with destinations to up-river locations since about mid-May.
That continues as we speak today and our third quarter guidance assumes that the water levels on this system will remain similar to where they are today. We cannot predict rainfall in the Midwest any better than we can predict potential hurricanes, therefore we based our guidance on current weather conditions and water levels going forward, although we are beginning to see some rain in the Midwest, which is encouraging.
Our third quarter guidance assumes our Coastal Marine Transportation business results should improve due to the seasonality of the refined products market as well as favorable operating conditions during the quarter. Since we purchased our coastal fleet in July of 2011, we have said the Coastal market is not a next quarter or 2012 story but operating results should improve over the next couple of years as supply and demand becomes more balanced, leading to higher equipment utilization. And maintenance and repair expenditures should decline as we bring this fleet up to what we think are appropriate equipment standards.
Our maintenance strategy will improve this fleet’s performance as well as its profitability, and our long-term strategy for this business remains intact. Our guidance assumes our legacy, Diesel Engine Service business, will be similar to the second quarter results, reflecting continued good marine and power generation markets. A more significant variable in the third quarter and the year guidance is United, with the decline of natural gas prices and its impact on manufacturing and remanufacturing pressure pumping equipment and service to the land-based oil and gas market.
Even with this volatility, however, United remains profitable. Its performance is consistent with our original acquisition pro forma and our initiative of focusing this business on the service side of the business will take out some of the future volatility.

There’s a lot of crude oil coming out of Eagle Ford which is South Texas. And that’s being moved by inland barge and, in some instances, coastal barge. There’s also a gathering pipeline systems that are being installed in that market. And what we have said in the past is that we think that, that barge demand at some point is going to be capped. We don’t think it’s going to go away, but we don’t think there’s going to be a lot of future growth coming out of South Texas.
Now having said that the need to supply crude oil to east coast refineries is significant. That’s going to be moved in larger vessels, these are the, you know, typically ships in the 340,000 barrel range. KC’s biggest barge is 185,000. That lends itself more to the refine products trade than actually moving crude oil. Where we do think there’s some offshore opportunity is the movement of some crude oil but also a lot of the condensate that’s coming out of Eagle Ford to refineries that can use it by offshore equipment. And that movement really is much better suited for barges that are in the KC range.
How the east coast gets their crude oil is still somewhat of a mystery. There’s talk of bulk and crude coming into Albany by train. Some of that’s happening today. We should have an opportunity to move some of that. I think we’ve already moved some of it. You, of course, have the imported crude, which is expensive relative to U.S.-crude-based pricing. But I’m not sure that, that’s all been worked out yet. You guys have anything to add to that?"

I think that, in our contracts, we do have low-water protection and we have minimum volume protection in most of the contracts. Where you may yet to be affected is if it continues to shoal, you’re going to see delays caused by dredging and you’re going to see some high-velocity currents as the river narrows.

Capacity additions are something that you watch closely. But as we look at the capacity that’s coming in the current fleet utilization and the growth in our markets, we’re really not that concerned about it for a couple of years.
Where you would get concerned about it is that if this building continued and you had a market issue where your volumes dropped. Then you could go into an overcapacity situation pretty quickly. I think that, they way the industry is building, you’re not going to see sharp drops in utilization without an effect on volume. And if utilization stays in the 90% range, you should continue to have some pricing power. If it begins to drop then you’d worry about it. And 2013, specific to your question about Kirby’s fleet, we could add about 300,000 barrels. Is that right? 300,000 barrels of additional capacity.

But yeah, clearly it’s a supply and demand situation. A lot of refined products are moved Coastwise and that demand is down because of the general economic weakness and so the market’s a little oversupplied.
As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, it - we knew it wasn’t a one quarter story, this is going to take some time to tighten up. There are approximately 40 to 45 coastal barges that are 185,000 barrels or less that are over 25 years old, so sooner or later that equipment’s going to come out and pricing, the market doesn’t justify building any new equipment right now.

Our second quarter earnings of $0.85 per share came in at the high end of our revised $0.80 to $0.85 per share guidance range. With respect to our Inland Tank Barge business it continued to perform well and operating results were above the 2011 second quarter results, despite some temporarily lower petrochemical volumes from one major customer principally due to plant maintenance outages as well as low water levels on the Mississippi river which led to light loading tank barges since mid-May and throughout June.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service Marine business operating results were also above the 2011 second quarter results principally due to improvements in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market. Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was about as expected except for the New York Harbor market which was a little softer. Higher maintenance and repair related issues and lower revenues caused by delays, plants and shipyards addressing this maintenance negatively impacted the second quarter.
For our land-based diesel engine service market with the current low price of natural gas, the incentive to drill for natural gas has been sharply curtailed. But the incentive to find crude oil remains positive. As a result, orders for manufacturing frac spreads have been curtailed but demand for remanufacturing existing equipment has improved. I’ll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about the third quarter and the full year outlook. I’m now going to turn the call over to Greg Binion who will discuss our Inland Tank Barge and Diesel Engine Service markets.

For the second quarter, our Inland Marine Transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range and higher term in spot contract pricing. In mid-May",982,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to all. For the second quarter, our Inland Marine Transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range and higher term in spot contract pricing. In mid-May we started to experience low water conditions on the Mississippi river system and reduced operating drafts. Those conditions persist today.
During the second quarter, we also were affected by some scheduled and unscheduled maintenance at a major Petrochemicals customer facilities. These facilities are now back in service. Black oil demand remains strong driven by continued stable refinery output and the continued exportation of heavy fuel oil. Also the movement of crude oil along both the river and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway continues to be brisk. I’d also note that we did load our first Bakken crude cargo out of St. Louis over the weekend. Refined product demand remains positive, benefiting from additional volumes from major customers. In our Agricultural Chemicals demand, driven by low inventory levels and high corn prices, remains strong in April and May but it declined sharply in June as expected.
Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and the freightment business continued to be about 55% and 45% respectively.
Turning to the Inland Marine Transportation pricing, term contracts during the second quarter continued to be renewed in the mid-single digit level with some cases slightly higher pricing when compared to the 2011 second quarter. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rates increase modestly when compared to the 2012 first quarter. We continue to invest in our Inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading existing barges. This reduces maintenance cost and out of service days and improves the reliability of the fleet and our customer service.
During the 2012 first 6 months, we took delivery of 20 new 30,000-barrel tank barges and 8 new 10,000-barrel tank barges totaling approximately 650,000 barrels of capacity. We retired 27 tank barges and returned 3 chartered tank barges, reducing capacity by about 470,000 barrels. So net, net during the 2012 first 6 months our inland tank barge fleet decreased by one but our capacity increased by approximately 180,000 barrels.
As of June 30 we operated 818 tank barges with a capacity of 16.4 million barrels. We also took delivery of 2 2,000-horsepower inland towboats in the 2012 second half. In May of 2012 we signed contracts for the construction of 36 new 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and 20 new 10,000-barrel tank barges all totaling approximately 1.2 million barrels of capacity.
Three of the 30,000-barrel tank barges are currently planned for delivery in late 2012 and the balance of these barges will be delivered throughout 2013. At the present time many of these new tank barges are anticipated to be replacements for older barges removed from service.
For the second half of 2012 our construction program will consist of 8 new 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and 22 10,000-barrel inland tank barges with a total capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. We will also take delivery of 3 additional canal towboats. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats during 2012 and progress payments made on barges and towboats delivered in 2013 will be about $130 million.
We also continue to retire older barges during the 2012 second half, and at the present time we anticipate that our 2012 year-end capacity will be approximately 16.5 million barrels or 350,000 barrels above the 16.2 million that we had at the beginning of the year.
In the 2012 fourth quarter we will take delivery of 2 new offshore dry bulk barge tug units for the use of under long-term contracts. The cost is about $52 million for each of these units. During 2011 and the first half of 2012 we made progress payments on these units totaling approximately $65 million, and the balance will be paid during the 2012 second half.
Turning to our Diesel Engine Service segment. United, a land-based service provider, as anticipated, saw revenues and operating income decline, the result of order cancellation and postponement for the manufacturing of fracturing units, as well as modest declines in the service of land-based diesel engines and the sale of engines, transmissions and parts, all associated with the low price of natural gas and resulting declines in drilling for natural gas in the North American shale formations.
Partially offsetting the decline in manufacturing of fracturing units was the demand for remanufacturing of such units. However, it will take us several quarters for United to obtain its optimal efficiency level for the process of remanufacturing these units. Currently United has 29 units in its facilities either in the process of being remanufactured or in the queue to start the process with commitments from our customers to send more units to be remanufactured as capacity becomes available in a reman facility.
We said since we announced the acquisition of United that our vision was to move the majority of United’s business to service, including the reman of all service equipment along with parts and distribution as a means to establish a more stable revenue and earnings stream while preserving the ability to layer in manufacturing as the market presents the opportunity to do so. We are on the path towards achieving this business model.
Our legacy Diesel Engine Service Marine business reported higher operating results, benefiting from an improved oil service activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico as well as from international customers. Business was also brisk for major overhauls and gear work for inland tank barge and dry cargo operators as well as coastal operators. The power gen market benefited from strong part sales and continued favorable engine generator set-up grades during the second quarter.
I’ll now turn the call over to David."

Overall equipment utilization was in the 75% range for Kirby Offshore Marine. The Pacific, Alaska and Hawaiian markets reported higher utilization levels, however the New York market, the New York Harbor market in particular, saw lower equipment utilization levels and corresponding competitive bidding for available movements.
During the second quarter we had an additional $500,000 in severance charges associated with the integration of Kirby Offshore Marine into Kirby. We had the negative impact of maintenance and repair-related equipment unavailability issues that negatively impacted results as well. We continued -- with continued low equipment utilization and excess capacity in the New York Harbor market during the second quarter, we did reposition 4 tank barges and 2 tugboats to the Gulf Coast market; and the repositioning costs for these moves were included in our second quarter results.
With respect to pricing, contracts that renewed for Kirby Offshore Marine during the quarter and spot-contract rates were basically flat. Approximately 60% of Kirby Offshore Marine’s revenues were under term contracts with 40% being spot contracts. Time charters represented approximately 90% of the revenues under term contracts during the second quarter.
Moving to Kirby general financial data, late yesterday, as you know, we announced net earnings for the second quarter of $0.85 per share compared with $0.77 per share from the second quarter last year. For comparison purposes, the 2011 second quarter results included about $0.07 negative impact from the record-setting high water and flood conditions we had last year.
A continued strong perform in our Inland Transportation sector and the acquisition of Kirby Offshore Marine, which was effective July 1 of last year, resulted with our Marine Transportation segment revenues being 28% above and operating income 23% above the 2011 second quarter. The Marine Transportation segment second quarter operating margin was 21% compared to 21.9% from last year. As Greg noted, during the second quarter, our inland-marine transportation fleets 90% to 95% equipment utilization continued along with favorable pricing.
The Inland sector contributed about 80% of the second quarter’s Marine Transportation segment revenue. We estimate that the low water levels on the Mississippi River and the maintenance issues at a major petrochemical customer’s facilities negatively impacted the second quarter by about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Despite these temporary negative issues, our Inland Marine operations maintained an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the second quarter.
Kirby Offshore Marine contributed about 20% of the second quarter’s Marine Transportation revenues. With the maintenance and repair-related issues negatively impacting earnings and an additional $500,000 severance charge coupled with the weak New York harbor market and the re-positioning costs, the operating margin at Kirby Offshore Marine was in the low single-digit range.
Our Diesel Engine Services revenue for the 2012 second quarter was in line with 2011 second quarter, which both periods included United. However, last year United acquisition was completed on April 15.
Diesel Engine Services operating margin -- operating income was 14% lower than the 2011 second quarter and the second -- and the segment’s operating margin was 8.9% compared with 10.3% for the second quarter last year. The decline in operating margin and operating income was due to the lower results from United, that Greg noted. United contributed approximately 70% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue during the second quarter.
With the decline in manufacturing revenue, specifically fracturing units, and replaced to some degree with remanufacturing of fracturing units, United earned an operating margin in the mid- to high-single digit range for the second quarter. The legacy marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 30% of Diesel Engine Services revenue during the second quarter and they benefited from improved Gulf Coast offshore service market and some large overhaul projects for the inland and coastal marine customers that they have.
We continued to generate significant cash during the first just of 2012, with EBITDA of $243 million. Our capital spending for the first half was $154 million and consisted of $70 million for new inland tank barges and tow boats, $32 million for progress payments on the 2 new offshore dry bulk barge and tug units and $52 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing inland and coastal fleet, as well as some spending on the Diesel Engine Services facilities.
We have raised our capital spending guidance for 2012 to $290 million to $300 million range, including $130 million for construction of new inland equipment, approximately $70 million in progress payments for the 2 offshore dry bulk units, with the balance attributable to upgrades for the inland and coastal fleets, as well as some progress payments on -- for the inland tank barges ordered in 2012 for late 2012 and 2013 deliveries.
As of June 30, we had $106 million outstanding on our $250 million revolving credit facility, and as of this morning, our revolver’s outstanding balance was $91 million. With respect to the United earn-out, during the first quarter of 2012, based on United’s earnings, we booked $4.2 million or $0.05 per share in expense as our estimate of the earn-out increased. During this second quarter, with the decline in natural gas prices and the subsequent weaker market for manufacturing of fracturing units, we held the contingent liability flat making only a slight adjustment to reflect the time value of money. As of June 30, we have recorded an earn-out liability of $26.9 million. As there are 18 months remaining for the earn-out period, you can understand that we may be required to make further adjustments, either up or down to this contingent liability. We have consequently excluded any future changes to the earn-out contingent liability from our guidance.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Joe."

I’m going to talk about the outlook going forward. Yesterday afternoon we announced our guidance for the third quarter of $0.87 to $0.97 per share. This compares with $0.94 per share earned in the 2011 third quarter. T",487,"Okay. Thank you. Thank you, David. I’m going to talk about the outlook going forward. Yesterday afternoon we announced our guidance for the third quarter of $0.87 to $0.97 per share. This compares with $0.94 per share earned in the 2011 third quarter. The 2012 and 2011 third quarters are a direct comparison as the third quarter last year results included United purchased on April 15, 2011 as well as Kirby Offshore Marine, which was purchased July 1, 2011. For the year, our guidance is $3.50 to $3.70 per share compared to the 2011 results of $3.33 per share.
As we stated earlier, our Inland Marine Transportation sector is doing well, favorable pricing trends and we anticipate that this is going to continue throughout the rest of this year and into next year. As I’m sure you’re aware, draught conditions in the Midwest have created low water conditions on the Illinois, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. These low water conditions negatively impacted our second quarter as well as reducing drafts on our barges with destinations to up-river locations since about mid-May.
That continues as we speak today and our third quarter guidance assumes that the water levels on this system will remain similar to where they are today. We cannot predict rainfall in the Midwest any better than we can predict potential hurricanes, therefore we based our guidance on current weather conditions and water levels going forward, although we are beginning to see some rain in the Midwest, which is encouraging.
Our third quarter guidance assumes our Coastal Marine Transportation business results should improve due to the seasonality of the refined products market as well as favorable operating conditions during the quarter. Since we purchased our coastal fleet in July of 2011, we have said the Coastal market is not a next quarter or 2012 story but operating results should improve over the next couple of years as supply and demand becomes more balanced, leading to higher equipment utilization. And maintenance and repair expenditures should decline as we bring this fleet up to what we think are appropriate equipment standards.
Our maintenance strategy will improve this fleet’s performance as well as its profitability, and our long-term strategy for this business remains intact. Our guidance assumes our legacy, Diesel Engine Service business, will be similar to the second quarter results, reflecting continued good marine and power generation markets. A more significant variable in the third quarter and the year guidance is United, with the decline of natural gas prices and its impact on manufacturing and remanufacturing pressure pumping equipment and service to the land-based oil and gas market.
Even with this volatility, however, United remains profitable. Its performance is consistent with our original acquisition pro forma and our initiative of focusing this business on the service side of the business will take out some of the future volatility.
Operator, we’re now ready to open the call up for questions."

There’s a lot of crude oil coming out of Eagle Ford which is South Texas. And that’s being moved by inland barge and, in some instances, coastal barge. There’s also a gathering pipeline systems that are being installed in that market. And what we have said in the past is that we think that, that barge demand at some point is going to be capped. We don’t think it’s going to go away, but we don’t think there’s going to be a lot of future growth coming out of South Texas. Now having said that the need to supply crude oil to east coast refineries is significant. That’s going to be moved in larger vessels, these are the typically ships in the 340,000 barrel range. KC’s biggest barge is 185,000. That lends itself more to the refine products trade than actually moving crude oil. Where we do think there’s some offshore opportunity is the movement of some crude oil but also a lot of the condensate that’s coming out of Eagle Ford to refineries that can use it by offshore equipment. And that movement really is much better suited for barges that are in the KC range. How the east coast gets their crude oil is still somewhat of a mystery. There’s talk of bulk and crude coming into Albany by train. Some of that’s happening today. We should have an opportunity to move some of that. I think we’ve already moved some of it. You, of course, have the imported crude, which is expensive relative to U.S.-crude-based pricing. But I’m not sure that, that’s all been worked out yet. You guys have anything to add to that?"

I think that, in our contracts, we do have low-water protection and we have minimum volume protection in most of the contracts. Where you may yet to be affected is if it continues to shoal, you’re going to see delays caused by dredging and you’re going to see some high-velocity currents as the river narrows.

The real issue is the economy particularly in the New York area and the East Coast, miles driven and gasoline consumption, diesel consumption, it’s been low. There is excess equipment. In the New York Harbor we’ve had the entrant of -- entrance of a competitor that got pretty aggressive too. The positive is we are seeing things improve a little bit on the West Coast and as Joe mentioned, there’s some possibility for condensate moves, cross-Gulf condensate moves that could use some of the industry capacity in the 80,000 to 100,000 barrel range, which should tighten it up. But yes, clearly it’s a supply and demand situation. A lot of refined products are moved Coastwise and that demand is down because of the general economic weakness and so the market’s a little oversupplied. As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, it -- we knew it wasn’t a one quarter story, this is going to take some time to tighten up. There are approximately 40 to 45 coastal barges that are 185,000 barrels or less that are over 25 years old, so sooner or later that equipment’s going to come out and pricing, the market doesn’t justify building any new equipment right now.

We announced last night that our third-quarter earnings of $0.95 per share came at the upper end of our $0.87 to $0.97 per share guidance range. Inland tank barge business continues to perform well with results that were above 2011 third quarter levels despite the low water conditions throughout the Mississippi River system that created a number of operating challenges this quarter, in addition to the delays caused by hurricane Isaac which was also in the quarter. 
Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was roughly in line with the 2012 second-quarter levels although we are beginning to see some modest improvement, particularly towards the latter half of the quarter. Our marine diesel engine service, that’s our heritage diesel engine service, operating results were below their 2011 third-quarter results. This was principally due to the hurricane. The hurricane closed our Louisiana facilities for several days and low water conditions which had some of our customers deferred maintenance projects and to a lesser extent of the timing of projects. 
In our land-based diesel engine service business, the market for new pressure pumping units continues to be very weak and is the primary factor in the decline in overall diesel engine service revenues compared to last year. I am going to come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about the fourth quarter and the year outlook. 
I’ll now turn the call over to Greg Binion who will discuss our inland tank barge and diesel engine service markets. And then today David will discuss the coastal tank barge market as well as the financial update.

The low water co",802,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning to all. For the third quarter, our inland transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range with both higher term and spot contract pricing. The low water conditions on the Mississippi River which began in mid-May caused -- persisted through the third quarter causing delays, light loadings and smaller tow sizes all of which caused a reduction in our ton miles. These conditions have continued into October and could extend into the fourth quarter as we continue to experience drought conditions in the Midwest which impacts our river loadings and efficiency. 
To date we have not seen sufficient rainfall to relieve the situation and there is a possibility for the situation to get worse in sections of the upper Mississippi river near St. Louis. As they did last year in the high water, the Army Corps of Engineers has done a very good job in keeping the river open and continues to work with industry to minimize commercial disruptions. We will continue to update you on the situation as it develops further. 
During the third quarter, hurricane Isaac also drove increased delay days forcing us to limit or suspend operations for as many as nine days for vessels in Southeast Louisiana. While operating conditions were and remain challenging, demand across our inland markets remains strong. Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remain at 75% and the mix of the time charter and the freightment business for the third quarter was 58% and 42% respectively. 
Turning to the inland marine transportation pricing, term contracts during the third quarter continued to be renewed in the mid-single-digit level and in some cases higher when compared to 2011 third quarter. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel saw rate increases modestly when compared to the 2012 second quarter. During the 2012 first nine months, we took delivery of 53 new tank barges, totaling 972,000 barrels of capacity and retired 40 tank barges with 635,000 barrels of capacity. 
In addition, we completed the transfer of four coastal tank barges to the inland fleet, adding 91,000 barrels of capacity for a net capacity add of 428,000 barrels. We also added the Lyondell fleet of 17 tank barges with 243,000 barrels of capacity. I’d point out that as we previously operated this fleet for Lyondell, this addition does not affect our revenue or cost structure. So net, net during the first nine months, we added 34 tank barges to our fleet and increased our capacity by 671,000 barrels. 
As of September 30, we operated 853 tank barges with a capacity of 16.9 million barrels. We also took delivery of three 2000 horsepower inland towboats in the 2012 first nine months. Our fourth quarter construction program will consist of two 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and two towboats. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats delivered during 2012 and progress payments on barges and towboats delivered in 2013 will be approximately $130 million. 
We will also continue to retire older barges during the 2012 fourth quarter. At present time we anticipate our 2012 year-end capacity to be approximately 16.8 million barrels or 600,000 barrels above the 16.2 million barrels at the beginning of the year, which -- note this number includes the Lyondell addition. Our 2013 construction program consists of 56 tank barges totaling 1.2 million barrels of capacity and three towboats with vessels scheduled for delivery throughout 2013. At the present time, the majority of these new barges are planned to be replacements for older barges. 
Turning to our diesel engine services segment, United, our land-based service provider, saw revenues and operating incomes decline year-over-year 25% and 43% respectively. Sequentially, revenues and operating income was close to flat. The year-over-year revenue decline was a result of the significant reduction in orders for the manufacturing of pressure pumping units. We also experienced a decline in the sale of engines, transmissions and other parts. Partially offsetting the decline in the manufacturing of pressure pumping units was an increase in the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units. 
Our legacy diesel engine services business reported lower operating results, primarily due to the timing of customer deferrals of several large projects in the Midwest due to the low water conditions and due to the effect of hurricane Isaac, which closed most of our Gulf Coast operations for several days. The diesel engine services segment also incurred additional operating expenses related to start-up costs associated with the new marine product distribution agreement and a new engine certification for the power generation market. 
The power generation market benefited from strong parts and continued favorable engine generator set upgrades during the third quarter. 
I will now turn the call over to David.

Kirby Offshore Marine’s overall equipment utilization rate was just under 80% with the Atlantic, Pacific, Alaska and Hawaii markets showing some signs of improvement. Although New York Harbor remained relatively weaker, the equipment we repositioned from New York Harbor market to the inland Gulf Coast market during the second quarter has had a positive impact. And we did see some modest improvement in market conditions in the month of September. 
With respect to pricing at Kirby Offshore Marine, spot contract rates were up in the mid-single-digits. No term contracts were renewed during the quarter. 
Before I turn to the financials, let me update you on our Allied acquisition. We received early termination for our Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we are on track to close early in this fourth quarter. We are moving forward with our integration plans with Allied and are looking forward to the business that this will bring to Kirby. 
Moving to the financial data, yesterday as we - we announced net earnings for the 2012 third quarter of $0.95 per share which included an estimated $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact from the low water conditions on the Mississippi River and the delays caused by the hurricane. And this compares to $0.94 per share reported in the 2011 third quarter. 
Due primarily to the impact of challenging weather in the quarter, marine transportation revenues were relatively flat while operating income was 5% above 2011 third quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 80% of the third quarter’s marine transportation segment revenue. Kirby Offshore Marine contribute approximately 27% of the third quarter’s revenues in marine transportation. 
Despite unfavorable weather impacts, our inland operations maintained an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the third quarter. Kirby Offshore Marine’s operating margin was in the high single digit range. The overall marine transportation segment third-quarter operating margin was 23.4% compared with 22% for the third quarter of 2011. 
Our diesel engine services revenue for the 2012 third quarter was 19% below the 2011 third quarter. Diesel engine services operating income was 31% lower than the third quarter year ago and the segment’s operating margins were at 8.5% compared with 10% for the third quarter of 2011. The decline in operating income and operating margin was due to the lower results at United. 
United contributed approximately 70% of the diesel engine services segment’s revenue during the third quarter and United earned an operating margin in the mid-to high single digit range for the 2012 third quarter. The legacy diesel engine operations contributed about 30% of diesel engine services revenue during the third quarter and their operating margin was in the low double-digit range. At the end of August, we raised our unsecured revolving credit facility from $250 million to $325 million in part to facilitate the closing of our acquisition of Allied Transportation 
As of September 30, we had $101 million outstanding on under our revolving credit agreement. This morning our revolver’s outstanding balance was $74 million. We ended the third quarter with $782 million in debt and as of this morning, it was $754 million. 
That’s all I had. And I'll turn the call back to Joe.

This compares with the $1 per share earned in the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year, our guidance is $3.53 to $3.63 per share compared to $3.33 for the 2011 year. 
Our inland marine transportation sector is performing well with favorable pricing trends and we anticipate this performance to continue. Liquid movements from shale formations and Canadian crude oil movements from the upper river system have kept positive pressure on barge utilization and has absorbed new barge capacity. This should continue into next year. 
Low water conditions throughout the Mississippi River system negatively impacted our third-quarter results. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that operating restrictions and resulting delays and lower ton miles created by low water levels continue into the fourth quarter. We’re also assuming normal seasonality associated with typical winter weather conditions. 
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes our coastal marine transportation business will experience a normal seasonal decline in the fourth quarter, partially offset by some very modest year-over-year improvement in rates and utilization. This business continues to improve as capacity is removed. It’s also benefiting from crude oil movements, which is absorbing capacity. We see nothing that suggests this won’t continue. The sector would also benefit from a stronger economy.
With respect to our legacy diesel engine business, our fourth quarter guidance assumes that results will reflect fewer power generation engine generator set projects, resulting in a sequential decline in the fourth quarter. The core service business with respect to our heritage business continues to strengthen. What pulls earnings around are delivery schedules of large projects and the timing of overhauls.
The largest variable in the fourth quarter and full year guidance is United and frankly this will, I think, also be true in 2013. Although we expect continued improvement in United’s revenue from the service side of this business - these are the service revenues - the current volatility in natural gas prices and the subsequent decline in demand for pressure pumping equipment to service North American shale regions creates uncertainty and lower revenue and earnings in the near term, and we believe into 2013. New orders for pressure pumping equipment have essentially stopped and the supply and distribution part of this business has slowed. 
Bright spot in the business is the service of remanufacturing of oilfield equipment, particularly pressure pumping equipment. Unfortunately this side of the business will not replace the earnings dollar for dollar compared to the business operating in what is typically a more healthy environment where you have both remanufacturing and some new manufacturing. We certainly expect this business to be profitable in the fourth quarter and we also expect it to be profitable in 2013. So we’re not saying that it's going to lose money but it’s going to be as profitable as it has been in 2011 and 2012. 
Except for the United business, the fundamentals of our other businesses is actually pretty strong. United business will get stronger as pressure pumping business gets better which most are projecting will occur in late 2013 or early 2014. In January when we announce our full year earnings we will be more specific with respect to our businesses and will provide some actual earnings guidance at that time.

We’ve engaged with a consultant that is helping us look at our organization and really kind of reengineer the company so the we maximize our efficiency. It’s a work in process. We are making progress but it’s going to be slow to steady progress. As we said, that business is much more difficult to do than building new units, which is good and bad. It takes a while for us to get it right but it also is more difficult. And once we do get it right should give us a sustainable competitive advantage in that space.

But what we’re able to do that Kirby uniquely can do this is take barges that will fit in inland servicer and move them into that service. I think with respect to the coastal trade, doing much more of that would be giving up the opportunities going forward because we see that business moving to balance. It’s slow but steady, you see the equipment being in some cases shifted to really a product, movement  of crude oil. And with any reasonable increase in the economy you’re going to stimulate more gasoline movements. 
So I don't think the industry is set that far from balance. On the inland business we had in 2008 going into the recession a fleet that was older than our coastal fleet, and we used the opportunity of reduced demand as an opportunity to take barges kind of out of services, frankly it should have been taken out probably couple years before. But demand was such that we needed them and embarked on a replacement program at very attractive prices that go down age of the fleet. And as Greg explained, it significantly increased our reliability with the newer equipment. So it was a little different, I think, scenario on the inland side than on the coastal side right now.

The 30,000 barrel fleet for the most part is a low river Gulf of Mexico fleet. Now there are some exceptions. So there is some crude oil now being moved out of St. Louis which is new. And there are some unit tows that operate but the bulk of the 30,000 barrel fleet is a lower river canal based fleet. And that would have been unaffected really by low water conditions and I think that the utilization which drove I think the pricing increases that we and others saw was just real demand that was being handled by that fleet.

And that really is our focus, making it efficient and then pushing as much as you can through current facilities without investing capital. We can invest the capital. We have positioned ourselves to add to the facility that we have by buying the adjacent property and actually taking that property that was leased and buying it. 
But our effort is to maximize the capacity that we have and then to add capacity once we've done that. And I think we will have a much better feeling for all of that by the first next year.

We announced last night that our third quarter earnings of $0.95 per share came at the upper end of our $0.87 to $0.97 per share guidance range. Our inland tank barge business continues to perform well with results that were above 2011 third quarter levels, despite the low water conditions throughout the Mississippi River system that created a number of operating challenges this quarter, in addition to the delays caused by Hurricane Isaac, which was also in the quarter.
Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was roughly in line with the 2012 second-quarter levels although we are beginning to see some modest improvement, particularly towards the latter half of the quarter. Our marine diesel engine service, that’s our heritage diesel engine service, operating results were below their 2011 third-quarter results. This was principally due to the hurricane. The hurricane closed our Louisiana facilities for several days and low water conditions, which had some of our customers defer maintenance projects and to a lesser extent of the timing of projects.
In our land-based diesel engine service business, the market for new pressure pumping units continues to be very weak and is the primary factor in the decline in overall diesel engine service revenues compared to last year. I am going to come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about the fourth quarter and the year outlook.
I’ll now turn the call over to Greg Binion who will discuss our inland tank barge and diesel engine service markets. And then to David, who will discuss the coastal tank barge market as well as the financial update."

For the third quarter, our inland transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range, with both higher term and spot contract pricing. The low water conditions on the Mississippi River which began in mid-May caused -- persisted through the third quarter, causing delays, light loadings and smaller tow sizes, all of which caused a reduction in our ton miles. These conditions have continued into October and could extend into the fourth quarter, as we continue to experience drought conditions in the Midwest which impacts our river loadings and efficiency.
To date we have not seen sufficient rainfall to relieve the situation and there is the possibility for the situation to get worse in sections of the upper Mississippi River near St. Louis. As they did last year in the high water, the Army Corps of Engineers has done a very good job in keeping the river open and continues to work with industry to minimize commercial disruptions. We will continue to update you on this situation as it develops further.
During the third quarter, Hurricane Isaac also drove increased delay days, forcing us to limit or suspend operations for as many as 9 days for vessels in Southeast Louisiana. While operating conditions were and remain challenging, demand across our inland markets remains strong. Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is 1 year or longer in duration, remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and the freightment [ph] business for the third quarter was 58% and 42% respectively.
Turning to the inland marine transportation pricing, term contracts during the third quarter continued to be renewed in the mid-single-digit level, and in some cases higher, when compared to 2011 third quarter. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rate increases modestly when compared to the 2012 second quarter. During the 2012 first 9 months, we took delivery of 53 new tank barges, totaling 972,000 barrels of capacity and retired 40 tank barges with 635,000 barrels of capacity.
In addition, we completed the transfer of 4 coastal tank barges to the inland fleet, adding 91,000 barrels of capacity, for a net capacity add of 428,000 barrels. We also added the Lyondell fleet of 17 tank barges with 243,000 barrels of capacity. I’d point out that as we previously operated this fleet for Lyondell, this addition does not affect our revenue or cost structure. So net-net, during the first 9 months, we added 34 tank barges to our fleet and increased our capacity by 671,000 barrels.
As of September 30, we operated 853 tank barges with a capacity of 16.9 million barrels. We also took delivery of 3 2,000 horsepower inland towboats in the 2012 first 9 months. Our fourth quarter construction program will consist of 2 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 2 towboats. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats delivered during 2012 and progress payments on barges and towboats delivered in 2013 will be approximately $130 million.
We will also continue to retire older barges during the 2012 fourth quarter. At present time, we anticipate our 2012 year-end capacity to be approximately 16.8 million barrels or 600,000 barrels above the 16.2 million barrels at the beginning of the year, which -- note this number includes the Lyondell addition. Our 2013 construction program consists of 56 tank barges totaling 1.2 million barrels of capacity and 3 towboats, with all vessels scheduled for delivery throughout 2013. At the present time, the majority of these new barges are planned to be replacements for older barges.
Turning to our diesel engine services segments, United, our land-based service provider, saw revenues and operating incomes decline year-over-year 25% and 43% respectively. Sequentially, revenues and operating income was close to flat. The year-over-year revenue decline was a result of the significant reduction in orders for the manufacturing of pressure pumping units. We also experienced a decline in the sale of engines, transmissions and other parts. Partially offsetting the decline in the manufacturing of pressure pumping units was an increase in the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units.
Our legacy diesel engine services business reported lower operating results, primarily due to the timing of customer deferrals of several large projects in the Midwest, due to the low water conditions and due to the effect of Hurricane Isaac, which closed most of our Gulf Coast operations for several days. The diesel engine services segment also incurred additional operating expenses related to start-up costs associated with the new marine product distribution agreement and a new engine certification for the power generation market.
The power generation market benefited from strong parts and continued favorable engine generator set upgrades during the third quarter.

And this compares to $0.94 per share reported in the 2011 third quarter.
Due primarily to the impact of challenging weather in the quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were relatively flat, while operating income was 5% above 2011 third quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 80% of the third quarter’s Marine Transportation segment revenue. Kirby Offshore Marine contributed approximately 20% of the third quarter’s revenues in Marine Transportation.
Despite unfavorable weather impacts, our inland operations maintained an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the third quarter. Kirby Offshore Marine’s operating margin was in the high-single-digit range. The overall Marine Transportation segment third-quarter operating margin was 23.4% compared with 22% for the third quarter of 2011.
Our Diesel Engine Services revenue for the 2012 third quarter was 19% below the 2011 third quarter. Diesel Engine Services operating income was 31% lower than the third quarter 1 year ago and the segment’s operating margins were at 8.5% compared with 10% for the third quarter of 2011. The decline in operating income and operating margin was due to the lower results at United.
United contributed approximately 70% of the Diesel Engine Services segment’s revenue during the third quarter and United earned an operating margin in the mid-to high-single-digit range for the 2012 third quarter. The legacy diesel engine operations contributed about 30% of Diesel Engine Services revenue during the third quarter and their operating margin was in the low double-digit range. At the end of August, we raised our unsecured revolving credit facility from $250 million to $325 million, in part to facilitate the closing of our acquisition of Allied Transportation
As of September 30, we had $101 million outstanding on -- under our revolving credit agreements. This morning our revolver’s outstanding balance was $74 million. We ended the third quarter with $782 million in debt and as of this morning, it was $754 million.
That’s all I had. And I'll turn the call back to Joe."

Our 2012 fourth quarter guidance is $0.83 to $0.93 per share. This compares with $1 per share earned in the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year, our guidance is $3.53 to $3.63 per share compared to $3.33 for the 2011 year.Our Inland Mari",559,"Thank you, David. Our 2012 fourth quarter guidance is $0.83 to $0.93 per share. This compares with $1 per share earned in the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year, our guidance is $3.53 to $3.63 per share compared to $3.33 for the 2011 year.
Our Inland Marine transportation sector is performing well with favorable pricing trends and we anticipate this performance to continue. Liquid movements from shale formations and Canadian crude oil movements from the upper river system have kept positive pressure on barge utilization and has absorbed new barge capacity. This should continue into next year.
Low water conditions throughout the Mississippi River system negatively impacted our third quarter results. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that operating restrictions and resultant delays at lower ton miles, created by low water levels, continue into the fourth quarter. We’re also assuming normal seasonality associated with typical winter weather conditions.
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes our coastal Marine Transportation business will experience a normal seasonal decline in the fourth quarter, partially offset by some very modest year-over-year improvement in rates and utilization. This business continues to improve as capacity is removed. It’s also benefiting from crude oil movements, which is absorbing capacity. We see nothing that suggests that this won’t continue. The sector would also benefit from a stronger economy.
With respect to our legacy diesel engine business, our fourth quarter guidance assumes that results will reflect fewer power generation engine generator set projects, resulting in a sequential decline in the fourth quarter. The core service business, with respect to our heritage business, continues to strengthen. What pulls earnings around are delivery schedules of large projects and the timing of overhauls.
The largest variable in the fourth quarter and full year guidance is United, and frankly this will, I think, also be true in 2013. Although we expect continued improvement in United’s revenue from the service side of this business -- these are the service revenues -- the current volatility in natural gas prices and the subsequent decline in demand for pressure pumping equipment to service North American shale regions creates uncertainty and lower revenue and earnings in the near term, and we believe into 2013. New orders for pressure pumping equipment have essentially stopped and the supply and distribution part of this business has slowed.
Bright spot in the business is the service or remanufacturing of oilfield equipment, particularly pressure pumping equipment. Unfortunately this side of the business will not replace the earnings dollar-for-dollar, compared to the business operating in what is typically a more healthy environment, where you have both remanufacturing and some new manufacturing. We certainly expect this business to be profitable in the fourth quarter and we also expect it to be profitable in 2013. So we’re not saying that it's going to lose money, but it’s going to be as profitable as it has been in 2011 and 2012.
Except for the United business, the fundamentals of our other businesses is actually pretty strong. United business will get stronger as pressure pumping business gets better, which most are projecting will occur in late 2013 or early 2014. In January, when we announce our full year earnings, we will be more specific with respect to our businesses and we'll provide some actual earnings guidance at that time.

But the other thing that's happening is we’re getting some crude moves that are essentially cross-Gulf, coming out of the Corpus Christi area from at the Eagle Ford play that -- the crude's making it to Corpus Christi and then making it to water and there are some cross-Gulf moves over to the New Orleans area. And that has also helped tighten up the market.

You’ve elaborated a couple of times about the changes in the New York Harbor market and specifically relocating some equipment out of there. I go back and think about during the downturn, Kirby took this leadership position on the inland barge side, kind of cut the industry rational as a whole by doing some things with your fleet, maybe taking some retirements early and that kind of thing.
I am just kind of curious as to how you feel about the current size of your coastal business and how close you think you are from a size perspective, to being able to kind of influence that same behavior on the coast-wise business as you were able to on the inland side?"

But what we’re able to do that Kirby uniquely can do is take barges that will fit in inland service and move them into that service. I think with respect to the coastal trade, doing much more of that would be giving up the opportunities going forward because we see that business moving to balance. It’s slow but it's steady. You see the equipment being, in some cases, shifted to really a new product, the movement of crude oil. And with any reasonable increase in the economy you’re going to stimulate more gasoline movements.
So I don't think the industry is that far from balance. On the inland business, we had in 2008 going into the recession, a fleet that was older than our coastal fleet, and we used the opportunity of reduced demand as an opportunity to take barges kind of out of service, that frankly should have been taken out probably a couple years before. But demand was such that we needed them and embarked on a replacement program at very attractive prices that drove down the age of the fleet. And as Greg explained, it significantly increased our reliability with the newer equipment. So it was a little different, I think, scenario on the inland side than on the coastal side right now."

The 30,000 barrel fleet, for the most part, is a lower river Gulf of Mexico fleet. Now there are some exceptions. There is some crude oil now being moved out of St. Louis, which is new. And there are some unit tows that operate, but the bulk of the 30,000 barrel fleet is a lower river canal-based fleet.

Our inland tank barge business continues to perform well with results that were above 2011 third quarter levels, despite the low water conditions throughout the Mississippi River system that created a number of operating challenges this quarter, in addition to the delays caused by Hurricane Isaac, which was also in the quarter.
Demand for our coastal tank barge equipment was roughly in line with the 2012 second-quarter levels although we are beginning to see some modest improvement, particularly towards the latter half of the quarter. Our marine diesel engine service, that’s our heritage diesel engine service, operating results were below their 2011 third-quarter results. This was principally due to the hurricane. The hurricane closed our Louisiana facilities for several days and low water conditions, which had some of our customers defer maintenance projects and to a lesser extent of the timing of projects.
In our land-based diesel engine service business, the market for new pressure pumping units continues to be very weak and is the primary factor in the decline in overall diesel engine service revenues compared to last year. I am going to come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about the fourth quarter and the year outlook.

For the third quarter, our inland transportation sector continued its overall strong performance with high equipment utilization in the 90% to 95% range, with both higher term and spot contract pricing. The low water conditions on the Mississippi River which began in mid-May caused -- persisted through the third quarter, causing delays, light loadings and smaller tow sizes, all of which caused a reduction in our ton miles. These conditions have continued into October and could extend into the fourth quarter, as we continue to experience drought conditions in the Midwest which impacts our river loadings and efficiency.
To date, we have not seen sufficient rainfall to relieve the situation and there is the possibility for the situation to get worse in sections of the upper Mississippi River near St. Louis. As they did last year in the high water, the Army Corps of Engineers has done a very good job in keeping the river open and continues to work with industry to minimize commercial disruptions. We will continue to update you on this situation as it develops further.
During the third quarter, Hurricane Isaac also drove increased delay days, forcing us to limit or suspend operations for as many as 9 days for vessels in Southeast Louisiana. While operating conditions were and remain challenging, demand across our inland markets remains strong. Revenues from our long-term contracts, that is 1 year or longer in duration, remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and the affreightment business for the third quarter was 58% and 42% respectively.
Turning to the inland marine transportation pricing. Term contracts during the third quarter continued to be renewed in the mid-single-digit level, and in some cases higher, when compared to 2011 third quarter. Spot contract pricing, which includes the price of fuel, saw rate increases modestly when compared to the 2012 second quarter. During the 2012 first 9 months, we took delivery of 53 new tank barges, totaling 972,000 barrels of capacity and retired 40 tank barges with 635,000 barrels of capacity.
In addition, we completed the transfer of 4 coastal tank barges to the inland fleet, adding 91,000 barrels of capacity, for a net capacity add of 428,000 barrels. We also added the Lyondell fleet of 17 tank barges with 243,000 barrels of capacity. I’d point out that as we previously operated this fleet for Lyondell, this addition does not affect our revenue or cost structure. So net-net, during the first 9 months, we added 34 tank barges to our fleet and increased our capacity by 671,000 barrels.
As of September 30, we operated 853 tank barges with a capacity of 16.9 million barrels. We also took delivery of 3 2,000 horsepower inland towboats in the 2012 first 9 months. Our fourth quarter construction program will consist of 2 30,000 barrel inland tank barges and 2 towboats. The cost of the new inland tank barges and towboats delivered during 2012 and progress payments on barges and towboats delivered in 2013 will be approximately $130 million.
We will also continue to retire older barges during the 2012 fourth quarter. At present time, we anticipate our 2012 year-end capacity to be approximately 16.8 million barrels or 600,000 barrels above the 16.2 million barrels at the beginning of the year, which -- note this number includes the Lyondell addition. Our 2013 construction program consists of 56 tank barges totaling 1.2 million barrels of capacity and 3 towboats, with all vessels scheduled for delivery throughout 2013. At the present time, the majority of these new barges are planned to be replacements for older barges.
Turning to our diesel engine services segments. United, our land-based service provider, saw revenues and operating incomes decline year-over-year 25% and 43% respectively. Sequentially, revenues and operating income was close to flat. The year-over-year revenue decline was a result of the significant reduction in orders for the manufacturing of pressure pumping units. We also experienced a decline in the sale of engines, transmissions and other parts. Partially offsetting the decline in the manufacturing of pressure pumping units was an increase in the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units.
Our legacy diesel engine services business reported lower operating results, primarily due to the timing of customer deferrals of several large projects in the Midwest, due to the low water conditions and due to the effect of Hurricane Isaac, which closed most of our Gulf Coast operations for several days. The diesel engine services segment also incurred additional operating expenses related to start-up costs associated with the new marine product distribution agreement and a new engine certification for the power generation market.
The power generation market benefited from strong parts and continued favorable engine generator set upgrades during the third quarter.

Kirby Offshore Marine’s overall equipment utilization rate was just under 80%, with the Atlantic, Pacific, Alaska and Hawaii markets showing some signs of improvement. Although New York Harbor remained relatively weaker, the equipment we repositioned from New York Harbor market to the inland Gulf Coast market during the second quarter has had a positive impact. And we did see some modest improvement in market conditions in the month of September.
With respect to pricing at Kirby Offshore Marine, spot contract rates were up in the mid-single-digits. No term contracts were renewed during the quarter.
Before I turn to the financials, let me update you on our Allied acquisition. We received early termination for our Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we are on track to close early in this fourth quarter. We are moving forward with our integration plans with Allied and are looking forward to the business that this will bring Kirby.
Moving to the financial data, yesterday as we -- we announced net earnings for 2012 third quarter of $0.95 per share, which included an estimated $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact from the low water conditions on the Mississippi River and the delays caused by the hurricane. And this compares to $0.94 per share reported in the 2011 third quarter.
Due primarily to the impact of challenging weather in the quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were relatively flat, while operating income was 5% above 2011 third quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 80% of the third quarter’s Marine Transportation segment revenue. Kirby Offshore Marine contributed approximately 20% of the third quarter’s revenues in Marine Transportation.
Despite unfavorable weather impacts, our inland operations maintained an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the third quarter. Kirby Offshore Marine’s operating margin was in the high-single-digit range. The overall Marine Transportation segment third-quarter operating margin was 23.4% compared with 22% for the third quarter of 2011.
Our Diesel Engine Services revenue for the 2012 third quarter was 19% below the 2011 third quarter. Diesel Engine Services operating income was 31% lower than the third quarter 1 year ago and the segment’s operating margins were at 8.5% compared with 10% for the third quarter of 2011. The decline in operating income and operating margin was due to the lower results at United.
United contributed approximately 70% of the Diesel Engine Services segment’s revenue during the third quarter and United earned an operating margin in the mid-to high-single-digit range for the 2012 third quarter. The legacy diesel engine operations contributed about 30% of Diesel Engine Services revenue during the third quarter and their operating margin was in the low double-digit range. At the end of August, we raised our unsecured revolving credit facility from $250 million to $325 million, in part to facilitate the closing of our acquisition of Allied Transportation
As of September 30, we had $101 million outstanding on -- under our revolving credit agreements. This morning our revolver’s outstanding balance was $74 million. We ended the third quarter with $782 million in debt and as of this morning, it was $754 million.

This compares with $1 per share earned in the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year, our guidance is $3.53 to $3.63 per share compared to $3.33 for the 2011 year.
Our Inland Marine transportation sector is performing well with favorable pricing trends and we anticipate this performance to continue. Liquid movements from shale formations and Canadian crude oil movements from the upper river system have kept positive pressure on barge utilization and has absorbed new barge capacity. This should continue into next year.
Low water conditions throughout the Mississippi River system negatively impacted our third quarter results. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that operating restrictions and resultant delays at lower ton miles, created by low water levels, continue into the fourth quarter. We’re also assuming normal seasonality associated with typical winter weather conditions.
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes our coastal Marine Transportation business will experience a normal seasonal decline in the fourth quarter, partially offset by some very modest year-over-year improvement in rates and utilization. This business continues to improve as capacity is removed. It’s also benefiting from crude oil movements, which is absorbing capacity. We see nothing that suggests that this won’t continue. The sector would also benefit from a stronger economy.
With respect to our legacy diesel engine business, our fourth quarter guidance assumes that results will reflect fewer power generation engine generator set projects, resulting in a sequential decline in the fourth quarter. The core service business, with respect to our heritage business, continues to strengthen. What pulls earnings around are delivery schedules of large projects and the timing of overhauls.
The largest variable in the fourth quarter and full year guidance is United, and frankly this will, I think, also be true in 2013. Although we expect continued improvement in United’s revenue from the service side of this business -- these are the service revenues -- the current volatility in natural gas prices and the subsequent decline in demand for pressure pumping equipment to service North American shale regions creates uncertainty and lower revenue and earnings in the near term, and we believe into 2013. New orders for pressure pumping equipment have essentially stopped and the supply and distribution part of this business has slowed.
Bright spot in the business is the service or remanufacturing of oilfield equipment, particularly pressure pumping equipment. Unfortunately this side of the business will not replace the earnings dollar-for-dollar, compared to the business operating in what is typically a more healthy environment, where you have both remanufacturing and some new manufacturing. We certainly expect this business to be profitable in the fourth quarter and we also expect it to be profitable in 2013. So we’re not saying that it's going to lose money, but it’s going to be as profitable as it has been in 2011 and 2012.
Except for the United business, the fundamentals of our other businesses is actually pretty strong. United business will get stronger as pressure pumping business gets better, which most are projecting will occur in late 2013 or early 2014. In January, when we announce our full year earnings, we will be more specific with respect to our businesses and we'll provide some actual earnings guidance at that time.

You see the equipment being, in some cases, shifted to really a new product, the movement of crude oil. And with any reasonable increase in the economy you’re going to stimulate more gasoline movements. So I don't think the industry is that far from balance. On the inland business, we had in 2008 going into the recession, a fleet that was older than our coastal fleet, and we used the opportunity of reduced demand as an opportunity to take barges kind of out of service, that frankly should have been taken out probably a couple years before. But demand was such that we needed them and embarked on a replacement program at very attractive prices that drove down the age of the fleet. And as Greg explained, it significantly increased our reliability with the newer equipment. So it was a little different, I think, scenario on the inland side than on the coastal side right now."
