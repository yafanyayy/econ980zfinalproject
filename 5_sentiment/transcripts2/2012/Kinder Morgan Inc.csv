As usual we will be talking about Kinder Morgan Energy Partners which is one of the largest MLPs in America and about Kinder Morgan Inc., which I will refer to as KMI which is the general partner of KMP.
Also as usual we will be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I will give an overview of the results and accomplishments for 2011 and for the fourth quarter and an outlook for 2012 and Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer will give you the financial details for 2011. Then we will open it up for questions and Park Shaper, our President; Steve Kean and I will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.
Let me just start with KMI. It’s a simple and very positive story. Back when we did the IPO, we anticipated that we would have cash available to pay dividends for the year 2011 of $820 million and that we would use that to pay $1.16 in dividends. As a point of fact on a paid basis, we had $835 million in cash available for dividends and we paid $1.18.
Now if you move to the declared basis, we are declaring for this quarter $0.31, that means that actually our declared basis for 2011 we will have paid a $1.20, net $0.31 is obviously a penny increase since last quarter and is up 7% from the dividend that we declared that we anticipated when we did the IPO back in February of 2011.
As usual the results at KMI are driven by KMP and we’ve already previously stated that for 2012 on a declared basis we expect KMI to pay dividends, to declare dividends of a $1.35 a share, that’s a 13% increase over the 2011 declared dividend of a $1.20. And note that while we previously have presented dividends on a paid basis, from now forward they are going to be on a declared basis. If you look at it on a paid basis, our anticipated dividend for 2012 would be a $1.30 which is 12% above the 2011 budgeted amount. If that doesn’t confuse you, I don’t know what will. But at any rate, a very positive story and exceeded what we promised you in the IPO about 10 months ago or 11 months ago.
So obviously let me turn now to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is the driving force in the Kinder Morgan story. As you know about 98% to 99% of the cash generated at KMI comes as a result of distributions that come up from KMP. And at KMP, really the story has been, is, always will be about just two things. The first thing is the current cash that we generate which determines the current dividends and secondly it’s about the future growth of the operations which leads to increased cash flow in future years and therefore increased dividends.
So I think it’s the right way to look at 2011 is to look at it through those two perspectives and if you do that I think anyway you cut it, 2011 was a very good year. 2012 looks like it’s going to be an even better year.
Let me start from the vantage point of the current performance and Kim will give you a lot more details, but we will have distributed $4.61 for 2011 at KMP. That’s up almost 5% from the $4.40 we distributed for 2010. All five of our business segments produced earnings before DD&A in excess of what they produced in 2010 and our total segment earnings before DD&A was up 10% for the full year of 2011 when compared to full year 2010.
In terms of distributable cash flow before certain items, we were up 16% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year and if you look at it on per unit basis, distributable cash flow per unit which we think is the best way to judge our performance, we were at $4.68 for 2011 versus $4.43 in 2010. That’s an increase of 5.6%.
Another way of looking at it, of course markets are what they are, but we had very good returns for our unit holders and shareholders in 2011. KMP produced at an all end return of 29%, KMR 26% and KMI 11% on an annualized basis. So that’s looking at it from a current performance perspective. If you look at it from a future of growth perspective, during 2011 we put $2.6 billion into expansion, JVs and acquisitions. And this is the life blood for growing the company in the future.
I think we have tremendous opportunities for future growth in our set of businesses and that opportunity is really pretty diverse in nature. It relates to the continued emergence of natural gas shale plays, together with their associated liquids production. It relates to growth in CO2 demand in the Permian Basin. I’ll talk about that later. We’ve seen an acceleration of that demand over the last several quarters.
It relates to the increasing demand for export coal in our Terminals group. And the further mandates for the use of renewable fuels in both our Terminals and Products group. It also results from the opportunity to serve customers who want to export refined products, primarily diesel on the Gulf Coast, from US refineries on the Gulf Coast and to import gasoline into the Northeastern United States as we’ve had a closure of several refineries in that area as all of you know. In fact, I would say that this is the most diverse set of opportunities at any time in Kinder Morgan’s 15-year history.
Now let me talk about each business segment and again, looking at it through this twin perspectives of both present performance and future growth. In our Products Pipeline segment for full year 2011, we had good results on our Cochin pipeline and on Plantation and on our West Coast terminals. This was offset somewhat by lower volumes and revenues on our Pacific System and on Central Florida and our CALNEV pipelines.
To put that in perspective, for the fourth quarter, refined product volumes were down 2.5% compared to fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, the volumes were relatively flat for 2010. We always like to compare that with the EIA numbers on a national basis and those EIA members showed a decline of 1.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the full year. So getting to the point, our pipelines were a little worse than the EIA average in the fourth quarter, a little bit better for the full year.
If you look at the full year on our pipelines and break it out by commodity, diesel was actually up 0.4%. Jet fuel was up 4.1%, a pretty positive year and gasoline was off 1.4%. Now still in the Product segment, if you look ahead through the perspective of future growth, we have got a number of important projects in this segment.
One of the most important is our new Eagle Ford crude condensate line which will connect the Eagle Ford shale play with the Houston Ship Channel, that’s about a $220 million project. We are under construction. We expect to be in service by July of this year. Connected to that project, we have now announced a $130 million project to build a condensate processing facility or a splitter at our Galena Park facility on the Eastern Ship channel which will be connected to this new Eagle Ford Condensate line.
We already have 25,000 barrels per day of capacity being supported by contract with a major oil customer. The operation is expandable to a 100,000 barrels. We are actually now filing for the environmental permits at the 50,000 barrel level which we think is very doable from a demand standpoint and that would turn this $130 million project into roughly a $160 million project and ultimately as I said, the whole thing is expandable to a 100,000 barrels per day. We respect this project to be in service around June of 2014.
We also have a new pipeline also costing about $220 million and that's the Parkway pipeline. This is a 136 miles of 16 inch pipe and it will run from Norco, Louisiana up to Collins, Mississippi to connect to a storage drum on our plantation system. We do own 50% of that; Bolero owns the other 50%. The initial capacity is 110,000 barrels per day and again it’s also expandable. In this case up to 200,000 barrels per day and we expect to be in service in mid 2013.
Another project that hasn't received a lot of attention but which is imminent is our Cochin EP project. We are spending about $30 million to upgrade existing pipelines in order to facilitate the transportation of EP mix from Conway Sarnia, Ontario and this is providing service to our customer Nova. We expect to be in service on April 1 of this year.
And then we have two projects on the West Coast that are fairly significant. One is our Carson-7 project. That's a $77 million project building seven new tanks at our Carson, California terminal. That’s on schedule and budget. We brought the first two tanks online, the remaining five tanks will come online late in 2012 and early 2013.
And then our final project is our private Air Force Base storage and pipeline projects, a little short of $50 million in terms of CapEx and we expect to finish that project this quarter, the first quarter of 2012. So that's it on our products’ pipeline segment.
In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment of course 2011 was a good year for us; our transportation volumes were up 13%. That’s largely result of our pay will Fayetteville Express project coming online and strong volumes from the Eagle Ford on our Texas Intrastate. Our sales volumes were up 1% for the year. We had strong performance as a result of the KinderHawk and EagleHawk acquisitions and as a result of FEP and Eagle together and the processing spreads on our Casper-Douglas facility in Wyoming and we also had increased volumes on Red Cedar. Those positive results were offset in part by weaker performance on our Kinder Morgan Intrastate Gas Transmission and Trailblazers systems.
Now when you look at the future of natural gas and let me just say that all the projects I am talking about today and all the numbers we’re talking about today do not account for any impact from the El Paso acquisition at all. And obviously that’s very relevant for the natural gas segment because when we complete the El Paso acquisition that segment will increase dramatically in size. But without any impact of El Paso and looking at the future at our natural gas facilities we have a number of important projects.
First of all our Eagle Ford gathering joint venture with Copano continues to perform very well, we’re starting new contracts. We are increasing deliveries as Eagle Ford for production ramps up. Including our 50% equity interest in this Eagle Ford gathering joint venture and our 25% interest in EagleHawk Field services but excluding the crude and condensate line I referred to earlier, this segment, our natural gas segment has committed approximately $400 million to expansion projects in the Eagle Ford alone.
In the Haynesville, on our gathering system mirror, we have signed a new third party contract and we have added new interconnects and trading services, we ended the year averaging about a Bcf a day as we anticipated we would for 2011.
The third important project during the quarter in the year we closed one acquisition SouthTex Treaters for $155 million on November 30. SouthTex designs and manufactures natural gas treating plants. They have removed both CO2 and H2S from the gas system. That’s now part of our Kinder Morgan treating operations and that would allow us to offer our customers the option of owning or leasing this equipment. We think that broadens our earnings capability and broadens a service we can provide to our customers.
Turning to our CO2 operations for 2011, we had a record year. We were right on plan for earnings before DD&A and slightly above plan, if you look at it on the DCF basis. Now we benefited from higher oil and NGL prices. They ran about $6.00 higher than we had in our plan. And we also benefited from growing production at the Katz field and from some pretty successful effort to manage and reduce our cost across all of our operations. That management effort, they reduced cost more than offset an overall decline in SACROC and Yates production.
We also set annual production record just barely in our CO2 source fields in south west Colorado. The major disappointment was that Katz volumes did not live up to what we predicted. That’s our new field which we began flooding at early 2011.
To put that in perspective for you, for the full-year 2011, we averaged about 500 barrels a day. For the fourth quarter, we averaged about 1000 barrels a day and so far this quarter we are running at about 1,300 barrels per day. So what we believe is that our response was delayed by about 8 to 12 months beyond what we thought we would get when we originally projected our 2011 budget. But it is now behaving on a ramped up basis as we thought. It’s just coming on later. And when you come to our investor conference later this month, you will see that we’re projecting around 2,300 barrels to little over 2,300 barrels of production on average per day for 2012.
So we intend to see or expect to see a nice ramp up during 2012. The big opportunity though in CO2 for the future is satisfying. What’s really turning out to be a very strong demand from our customers in the Permian Basin for more CO2? Now, on previous calls I’ve talked about an opportunity size that would involve adding 200 to 300 million cubic feet a day of production from the source fields that would involve investing, I had said, $1 billion to $1.3 billion of additional capital at good returns.
We now think the opportunity is probably a little bigger than that and maybe as much as 400 to 600 million cubic feet a day of additional need for CO2 in the Permian Basin. That would translate an opportunity into opportunities to spend anywhere from $1 billion on the low side of this to $2 billion on the upside in accessing more production from our source fields and in moving that to market in the Permian Basin.
Now as we always say at Kinder Morgan, we are only going to do this if we are backed, if that demand is backed by solid contracts from creditworthy companies over extended periods of time and right now that’s looking very good. Tim Bradley will have more to say about that at our investor conference next week but today our board did approve in part an important first step in generating this additional CO2. We approved $255 million project in our Doe Canyon field in Southwest Colorado, which will take production there up from a 105 million cubic feet a day today to a 170 million cubic feet a day.
That $255 million will be spent over the next several years and will involve both in pricing and additional wealth. So a lot of opportunity here for real growth at very attractive returns backed by long-term contracts.
Turning to our terminal operation, in 2011 we continued to generate strong earnings before DD&A and DCF. I think it is important to note about 70% of that growth or about $40 million was attributable to organic sources as supposed to acquisitions and I know when we talk about that, we think 2% may be a little better in growth from organic sources in Kinder Morgan. People wonder well, where does that come from; 2% of the 2011 numbers would be 60 to 70 million and here we had $40 million of growth in the terminals group alone, from organic sources.
Now, where did that growth come from? We had strong growth in coal volume channels. We have been talking about that export coal story now for several quarter, we were up 33% in terms of coal volumes handled in the fourth quarter. More importantly for the full year we were up 20% versus 2010. And our Pier IX facility in Newport News, Virginia set a record; in that one terminal we handled almost 13 million tons of coal.
Our steel volumes were also positive for the year, up 18% in the fourth quarter, up 10% for the year. On the liquids terminal side, we had good performance at both our enormous Pasadena terminal here on the Houston Ship Channel and in our Carteret facility in New York Harbor.
We also handled 16 million barrels of ethanol in the fourth quarter. That was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our ethanol volumes were up 5%. If you look at Kinder Morgan including the products segment, we still are handling about 30% of all the ethanol used in the United States.
Now in our Terminals Group, we had an unusually large number of new commercial contracts signed which will lead over the next few years to some pretty important new projects. Our capital budget there for expansion CapEx is over $400 million for 2012 and in fact we have, based on commercial contracts signed specifically in 2011, we now have budgeted over $850 million in CapEx in the terminals projects over the next couple of years ’12 and ’13 and the first quarter of ’14 to be specific on projects that were locked in for certain contracts that we’re done during 2011.
So coming back to this perspective of looking at what did we accomplished from a future growth standpoint? The terminals had a tremendous year in 2011. First of all, the BOSTCO project, which probably the largest single project that we entered into. In December, we purchased TransMontaigne’s 50% interest, so we now own 98% of this $430 million project on the Houston Ship Channel.
And now let me remind you that as we previously said, and TransMontaigne has previously said, we have made that purchase; they do have certain rights to repurchase for a one year period; so between now and January of next year. But right now, we own 98% of the project. This first phase of that project will involve 52 storage tanks with the capacity of 6.6 million barrels; we’re handling residual fuel, distillates and other black oils. We have terminal service contracts or LOIs for all of that capacity.
Eventually, we see this terminal because of its location and the draft adjacent to this terminal. We see this as an important cog in the ability of Houston Ship Channel refiners to export refined products given the advantageous location and depth of water. The construction on this project started in December of 2011.
Another major project that we announced during 2011 was the Edmonton South Terminal. This is roughly a $210 million project at Edmonton Alberta. It involves building 2.4 million barrels of capacity for storage of crude oil and condensate. And our Trans Mountain Terminal has access right into our Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs across the Rockies and down into Vancouver and Washington State.
We’ll start construction on this in early this year and we expect to have it in service late in 2013. Now this is another project that anticipate will be scaled up over the next few years. We will eventually on that site build up to 6 million barrels in two additional phases. What this does for our customers, who are primarily oil sands producers and marketers, is it gives them additional optionality to use the oil sands production as that production expands and as crude oil pricing and differentials continue to remain extremely volatile as they have over the past several months.
We also will continue to expand our capacity for export coal at both IMT on Mississippi River, in Houston and eventually on some of our terminals on the East Coast; so a lot of opportunities for upside in our Terminals Group over the next few years.
In Kinder Morgan Canada, we had a good year in 2011 as refiners in Washington State wanted access to cheap oil sands production and the oil sands producers wanted to move more barrels over our dock in Vancouver, British Columbia. We expect that demand growth to continue; for that reason we are in the midst of an open season on an expansion to Trans Mountain. At the customer’s request, we extended that open season until mid-February and again we will proceed only if we have adequate binding commitments from customers to go forward. But we do see this as a tremendous opportunity in the future.
So all-in-all, we think we had a very good 2011 and we’ve build tremendous opportunities for 2012 and beyond. We expect to declare $4.98 in distribution for 2012 and to have excess coverage on top of that of about $70 million.
In addition, I’ll remind you that we said before the El Paso merger was announced, that we thought for the next several years, we could grow KMP at 5% which would lead to 10% growth at KMI. Post El Paso, we believe that we can grow at 7% at KMP and about 12% at KMI. But it’s important to note that all the numbers I’ve given to you again are pre-El Paso and we’ve well exceeded the 5% and 10% growth numbers that we talked about previously for growth at KMP and KMI respectively.
So we have good strong cash flow, very good growth opportunities for the future. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Kim.

If you turn to the first page, its numbers entitles the consolidated statement of income. I am not going to spend much time on this page, but just looking down, about 80% down the page, there is declared distribution per unit. We are declaring a distribution today at KMP of $1.16 per unit. That compares to a $1.13 last year and that’s up $0.03 quarter-to-quarter or about 3% growth. For the year, we have declared $4.61. That compares to 2010 of $4.40. That’s $0.21 per unit increase or almost a 5% increase. The $4.61 is also a $0.01 above our 2011 budget.
With that, I’ll turn to the second page of numbers called the contribution by business segments. Looking four lines from the bottom, the DCF before certain items for the fourth quarter in 2011 $425 million of DCF before certain items that compares to 2010 of $366 million, $59 million increase or about 16%. For the year, 1.5 billion to 5 billion; that compares to 1.36 billion in 2010; that’s a $165 million increase or about 12% versus our budget, the 1.5 billion to 5 billion. We are up about $11 million versus our budget.
If you look at what that translates into in terms of DCF per unit, that’s a $1.27 per unit which is about 8.5% growth versus last year for the quarter and for the year $4.68 per unit which is growth of almost 6%.
Our coverage, that was in excess coverage for the quarter of about $37 million. For the year, about $21 million and versus our budget we’re about $70 million below our budget with respect to coverage. But let me just give you an overall view versus our budget.
The segments ended up largely inline with their budget; interest was favorable about a little over $25 million; sustaining CapEx was positive versus our budget about $13 million. The total DCF available for distribution to our Limited Partners and our General Partners were up about $38 million versus our budget.
Our GP; we paid our GP about $27 million more than we budgeted. That was a function of incremental units that we issued during the year; about $5 million primarily associated with KinderHawk and the $0.01 that we increased the distribution.
So that leaves us with LC DCF versus our budget, about $11 million above our budget; then we also paid our Limited Partners about $26 million more, again because we increased the distribution above our budget and also because we had incremental units outstanding. And so that leaves us at about $16 million of lower coverage than what we budgeted.
Now if you adjust for Canadian tax refund that we expected to receive in 2011 that we did not receive in 2011, but we received notification that we will receive in 2012 and it is not included in our 2012 budget that we will go through next week. You add back that $6 million and you adjust for the incremental penny that was not in our budget, that's another roughly $6 million and you are within a few million dollars of our budget on coverage.
With that looking back up at the lines above the DCF before certain items, you look at book cash taxes, net $7.9 million in the quarter, $5 million last year, up $2.9 million. For the year $27 million versus $26 million last year, so up about a $1 million. For the year versus our budget, down about $10.9 million, but I think the key here is and what's important is really the cash taxes because all we are doing is adding back the book taxes. So the book taxes have no impact and then subtracting out the cash taxes. Absent the Canadian tax refunds, the cash taxes were on budget for the year.
Express, Endeavor and Eagle Ford contributions, these are adjustments that we make for investments that we have where the cash that we received doesn't track net income plus JV DD&A less our share sustaining CapEx, $7 million in the quarter, $2 million last year up $5 million, for the 12 months $15 million versus $5 million last year. So up $10 million and up about $8 million over our budget. We received incremental distributions from all three of these investments versus our budget.
Looking at sustaining CapEx, $72 million for the quarter, $58 million in the fourth quarter of last year, that's about $14 million increase in sustaining CapEx, $212 million for the year, that compares to $179 million last year, so up about $33 million versus last year, but actually about $13 million positive versus our budget. The $13 million versus our budget really breaks down into two pieces. Five is really lower capitalized overheads, basically our capitalized overhead rate is based on our total spending, our total expansion and sustaining capital. Our expansion capital increased significantly, so that rate came down but our sustaining capital was flat. So a lot of it is a function of capitalized overhead versus any changes in the segment spending.
$8 million is associated with the segment spending and that’s really at CO2, about half of that we didn’t have to do a power plant, overhaul the turbine for the flat power plant in CO2. And the other half is some non-safety, non-integrity deferrals. Now looking up at the segments and seeing what drove the growth, products pipeline, a $161 million in the quarter versus a $171 million last year or about $10 million down this year.
That compares to $694 million for the full year versus $688 million last year, that’s up about $7 million. Products came in about $36 million lower than its budget or about 5% and if you cut through it all, it is primarily SFPP. We had some ups and down on you know the different assets within the segment. And SFPP was largely associated with three things. With deferred rate case, rate cases and the lower rates that we implemented there with an adverse decision with respect to [UPR] right away cost, so increased right away cost and then lower volumes than what we budgeted.
Natural gas, in the fourth quarter $290 million versus $243 million a year ago, that’s up $47 million or 19%. For the 12 months, $951 million versus $836 million a year ago, up a $115 million or 14%. Natural gas was about 5% above this budget and that is largely a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, actually the KinderHawk acquisition contributes more than what they were above their budget and then we have some offsets primarily with some higher integrity spending on the Texas intrastate and lower fuel charges or collections on KMI and Trailblazer. Upstream was also up nicely for the year from higher processing margins and higher gathering volumes.
CO2 in the quarter, $281 million versus $242 million a year ago, up $39 million or 16% for the year, $1.093 billion, that compares to $960 million a year ago or up $133 million or 14%. CO2 was really on its budget. In reality it was slightly below its budget on earnings before DD&A and slightly above its budget on a DCF basis. That primarily was driven by, SACROC was above its budget as a result of higher price and lower OpEx and that was offset somewhat by lower volumes than what we budgeted. And then Katz and Eastern Shelf had lower volumes than what we budgeted. Yates & S&T were on their budget.
Terminal Segment, a $184 million in the third quarter, on the fourth quarter, a $173 million a year ago, up $12 million or 7%. For the year, $701 million versus $647 million a year ago, up $55 million or 8%. Terminal was about 2% below its budget. That was a function of higher fuel costs, timing on acquisitions versus our budget. Some of the acquisitions that we did happened later in the year than what we had originally thought. It is lower transload volumes, primarily ethanol in our material handling business, primarily as it lost some market share to unit trains. And then we had a steel mill that we served that was down for an extended period of time.
Kinder Morgan Canada for the quarter, $51 million versus $49 million a year ago, up $2 million or 4%. For the year, a $199 million versus a $182 million a year-ago, up 17% or 9%. For the year, Kinder Morgan Canada was about 3% above its budget and that was a function of FX, the implementation of a neutral settlement and then higher domestic volumes on our Express Platte pipelines.
Dropping down, about half way down the page to the G&A which you will see below the segment earnings contribution. G&A for the quarter, $86 million versus $87 million a year ago, still about a $1 million decrease. For the year, $388 million versus $375 million a year ago, still up about $13 million versus a year ago. The full-year number is up versus last year primarily due to a higher benefit. But it is right on top of our budget.
Interest expense which is the next line, a $137 million in the quarter, a $132 million a year ago, that is increased expense of about $5 million year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. For the year, it is up about $25 million and versus our budget as I mentioned earlier, it is about $28 million above our budget.
Now dropping down to the certain items, there are a couple that I will mention to you, most of them are relatively small this quarter, total certain items in the quarter, about $12.5 million, $3.8 million is associated with some higher environmental reserves that we took during the quarter. $5.2 million is associated with market-to-market on our CO2 hedges and then you can see in the footnotes down there, we continue to recognize those in the quarter as we settle those hedges and don’t mark them to market prior to that time up in the segment.
Insurance deductible casualty losses and reimbursement, that’s associated with a small fire that we had on our Total petcoke facility. For the year, certain items $491 million, the largest certain items, $82 million associated with allocated non-cash compensation. This is a $100 million pool that was paid by our shareholders, but GAAP requires us to allocate these cost to KMP. We have talked about this in our prior quarter.
KMP has not and will not pay anything associated with this (inaudible) program. Rate case reserves $235 million and we’ve discussed those in prior quarters and the KinderHawk asset write-off of a $167 million, that we have also discussed in prior quarters. So with that I will move to the balance sheet. Just two items to note on the balance sheet. You can see on cash and cash equivalent, we are up about $280 million from year end 2010 to year end 2011. A reasonable portion of that is associated with Dock premiums that we receive on our Canadian Westridge Dock and this is shipped on our Trans Mountain pipeline to pay a premium in order to get access to that Dock and then we actually refund those amounts over a three to five year timeframe.
The other thing I’d point out is on notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt. The $2.138 billion at 12/31/11 includes $500 million of 9% put bond. The timeframe with respect to the bondholder’s right to put those to us has expired and so only $50,000 worth of these bonds were put in our K. We will move the balance of that to long-term.
Looking down at the debt balance $12.4 billion at the end of the year that compares to about $11.4 billion at the end of last year, a $979 million increase for the year and about a $153 million increase in the quarter. For the quarter we had uses of a little over $600 million. That was about $290 million in CapEx, about $250 million in acquisitions. The largest acquisitions were SouthTex for $155 million, Watco for $50 million and then our purchase of Trans Mountain interest in the Bosco terminal for $30 million.
Contributions to equity investments was about $75 million, primarily associated with our joint venture in the Eagle Ford with Copano and with our 25% interest in the Eagle Ford with BHP. Equity issuance for the quarter was over $250 million and that was about 145 million through our KMP at-the-market program and than 109 on our KMR dividend. 
Working capital was a little bit over 200 million during the quarter. The largest piece of it during the quarter is really accrued interest. We typically paid most of our interest payment comp in the first and the third quarter. The Dock premiums as I mentioned we’ve receive a fair amount of Dock premiums during the fourth quarter. AP and AR was a source of cash of $30 million. We also had excess coverage as I mentioned earlier of 37 million and uses offsetting that, was gas and storage and [cash flows over draft].
For the year the change in debt $979 million. The uses were just about 2.76 billion, was about 987 million in CapEx a billion to 1.24 billion and acquisitions. In addition to the one time mentioned in the quarter for the year. We also have the KinderHawk acquisition for 912 million, 371 million in contributions equity investment, the largest one was the contribution to FEP. Then we also paid off some $77 million of incremental debt when we brought KinderHawk on to our balance sheet. We paid $81 million in CPC and perk settlement. We issued about $1.42 billion in equity between KMP and KMR and then we settled an interest rate swap, which were a source of cash at $73 million.
We sold a small terminal on the Netherlands, which is a source of $16 million and the working capital and other items were a source of cash of $271 million. For the year the sources of working capital, primarily the Dock premiums, coverage. We also had distributions from equity investments in excess of what we reflect in our DCF and then we had a loan to plantation which they repaid.
That results in a DEBT to EBITDA for the end of the year up 3.6 times. On the third quarter call I had said that we would end the year at about 3.7 times. We did a little bit better than that given the incremental equity that we issued in November and December that we hadn’t contemplated at the end of the third quarter and then also some of the cash that we received associated with the dock premiums.
So, that’s KMP looking at KMI, but the first case of numbers in your package you’ll see excluding the interim capital transaction and that relates to a one-time item that we had in 2010. And so we provide this because this is what is going to appear in the 10-K. But we don’t think this is a real way to look at our business and we would be happy to if it shows 28% growth for the year but we think the more appropriate way to look at our business is to adjust for that one-time item in 2010. And so looking at the second page which excludes the ITT, this is what we are going to focus on.
Now with respect to the numbers presented on this page. This is represented on the page. And so what we are looking at for the fourth quarter is what KMI received from KMP in the fourth quarter, based on the dividend that KMP declared for the third quarter of last year. So, we’re looking at, that’s the cash generated and then we are comparing that to the dividend that KMI paid during the fourth quarter, which would be $0.30 and that is in contrast to the dividend that we’re declaring today of $0.31.
Going forward, we will switch to a declared basis in order to be consistent with KMP. But looking at cash available to pay dividends, $243 million in the quarter versus $233 million a year ago, up 20 million or 9%. For the year, 835 million versus 763 million a year ago or up $72 million or 9%.
The 835 million was the cash available. We also paid out 835 million, which is a $1.18 that was already paid. $1.18 as Rich mentioned earlier, compares to our budget of $1.16 and so we exceeded our budget by $0.02.
Today what we are declaring is $0.31 a share. So, another reason that we’re making the switch from paid basis to declared basis is so that people can see, so that we can present for people, the numbers that we are basing the dividend that we’re declaring on.
And so, just to switch 2011 to a declared basis, cash available to pay dividend, if you presented it on a declared basis, would be $866 million. Dividends paid and that includes obviously the $0.31 or dividends declared using the 31 [Technical Difficulty] of excess coverage for the year looking at 2011 on a declared basis and given the $0.31 that we are declaring today. 
Now looking at what drove the growth in the year, if you look up about four lines from the top of the page, total KMP distribution were up $361 million in the quarter versus $315 million last year, $36 million increase or 11%. For the year $1.349 billion versus $1.202 billion a year ago, a $148 million increase or a 12% increase. That’s the $1.349 billion is about $19 million over our budget, primarily driven by the incremental amount that we received on the GP interest as a function of more units outstanding versus our budgets and the penny increase in the distribution.
NGPL, the next line item, NGPL cash available for distribution to us. You will see that we switched that from the prior quarter when we previously showed dividends paid to us given that we owed only 20% of this investment, we cannot control what they declare or what dividend out. But the cash is there. So what we are presenting is net income, actually pretax income plus DD&A, less cash taxes less sustaining cash balance. So we are presenting the cash that is actually generated by this entity given that we can’t control the difference, $7.6 million in the quarter versus zero last year up $10.6 million for the year, $30.3 million versus $34.7 million a year ago, down $4.4 million and down about $3 million versus our budget and that's just a function of lower transport margin and LPS on GPL.
G&A expense, basically up $3.5 million versus the fourth quarter last year, up $12.8 million versus for a year ago, versus a year ago and within about $2 million of our budget. Interest expense, $5.6 million in the quarter versus $5 million a year ago, basically flat, up slightly which has to do with slightly higher balance and for the year up $8.3 million and slightly positive versus our budget.
Cash taxes, $22.7 million, higher in the quarter versus a year ago and $49.7 million higher for the year right on top of our budget. They are higher versus a year ago due to the higher income.
So with that for KMI, I will turn to the balance sheet. Looking at KMI’s debt on the balance sheet, $3.236 billion as of 12/31 of ’11 versus $3.195 billion versus at 12/31 of ’10, so up about $41 million for the year, up $44 million for the quarter and let me just go through a quick reconciliation on that.
For the quarter, we had $243 million available to pay dividends. We paid dividends of $212 million. We also had a use of cash to pay El Paso financing fees of $56 million and then we had some items associated within GPL that were about $18 million. The metrics that we show versus the distributions that we actually received were about $9 million lower. And then NGPL actually reimbursed that from G&A in early January versus by the end of the year.
For the year, $41 million increase in debt; $835 million in cash available to pay dividends. $771 million in dividends paid. $64 million went out on a $100 million pool, when you add the $771 million of the dividends and the $64 million, that’s $835 million so that’s the $835 million that we referred to as paying in dividends, because our shareholders actually paid for the $100 million bonus pool.
The MBO settlement was a positive $29 million after-tax. KMR which we elected not to sell at the end of the year, you need to subtract $46 million, because we include that benefit in our metric; $56 million went out on the El Paso financing fees. We got about $69 million in tax refunds that were associated with one-time items and then $18 million that I mentioned on NGPL were the same for the year as they were in the quarter. That leaves us at 2.4 times on debt to distribution proceed; so a very strong balance sheet.

So we think it has inherent compelling advantages and I think that the real proof of that is that we’ve signed either terminal service agreements or we have LOIs for actually all of that capacity and a little more. And we think eventually, we will be available to expand that with a second dock and with additional tank and again eventually we think that would connect back to our Galena Park and Pasadena terminals and we will actually be able to move a variety of products down there.
Again, I think I’ve said this before, but I know I’ve said it earlier today that we believe that in the Gulf Coast, you have significant additional U.S. refining capacity being built. There will not be a demand for all of that production and we think that a good bit of it, particularly diesel will actually get exported particularly to South America, and if you believe that, Houston and Port Arthur and Beaumont are ideal areas to structure some facility to handle export volumes and that’s essentially what we’re doing.
On the other hand, we’ve got some major expansions on our Carteret facility, all subject to long-term contracts in New York Harbor. While that capacity is being utilized by our customers who are actually importing primarily gasoline into the U.S. Northeast to replace volumes that are no longer there because refineries in the Northeast were closed. So long-term, we think BOSTCO could become a much larger facility, I don’t think Jeff is in the room, but we have a lot of excess acreage here that allows us to build out significant additional storage beyond the 6.6 million barrels.

As usual we'll be talking about Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is one of the largest MLPs in America and about Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll refer to as KMI, which is the general partner of KMP.
Also as usual we will be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I will give an overview of the results and accomplishments for 2011 and for the fourth quarter and an outlook for 2012. And Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer will give you the financial details for 2011. Then we will open it up for questions and Park Shaper, our President; Steve Kean, and I will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.
Let me just start with KMI. It’s a simple and very positive story. Back when we did the IPO, we anticipated that we would have cash available to pay dividends for the year 2011 of $820 million, and that we would use that to pay $1.16 in dividends. As a point of fact on a paid basis, we had $835 million in cash available for dividends and we paid $1.18.
Now if you move to the declared basis, we are declaring for this quarter $0.31, that means that actually our declared basis for 2011 we will have paid a $1.20. Now $0.31 is obviously a $0.01 increase since last quarter, and is up 7% from the dividend that we declared that we anticipated when we did the IPO back in February of 2011.
As usual the results at KMI are driven by KMP, and we have already previously stated that for 2012 on a declared basis, we expect KMI to pay dividends -- to declare dividends of a $1.35 a share, that’s a 13% increase over the 2011 declared dividend of a $1.20. And note that while we previously have presented dividends on a paid basis, from now forward they are going to be on a declared basis. If you look at it on a paid basis, our anticipated dividend for 2012 would be a $1.30, which is 12% above the 2011 budgeted amount. 
If that doesn’t confuse you, I don’t know what will. But at any rate, a very positive story and exceeded what we promised you in the IPO about 10 months ago, or 11 months ago.
So obviously let me turn now to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is the driving force in the Kinder Morgan story. As you know about 98% to 99% of the cash generated at KMI comes as a result of distributions that come up from KMP. And at KMP, really the story has been, is, always will be, about just 2 things. The first thing is the current cash that we generate, which determines the current dividends and secondly it’s about the future growth of the operations which leads to increased cash flow in future years and therefore increased dividends.
So I think it’s the right way to look at '11 is to look at it through those 2 perspectives, and if you do that I think anyway you cut it, 2011 was a very good year. 2012 looks like it’s going to be an even better year.
Let me start from the vantage point of the current performance, and Kim will give you a lot more details. But we will have distributed $4.61 for 2011 at KMP. That’s up almost 5% from the $4.40 we distributed for 2010. All 5 of our business segments produced earnings before DD&A in excess of what they produced in 2010 and our total segment earnings before DD&A was up 10% for the full year of 2011 when compared to a full year of 2010.
In terms of distributable cash flow before certain items, we were up 16% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year and if you look at it on a per  unit basis, distributable cash flow per unit which we think is the best way to judge our performance, we were at $4.68 for 2011, versus $4.43 in 2010. That’s an increase of 5.6%.
Another way of looking at it, of course markets are what they are, but we had very good returns for our unit holders and shareholders in 2011. KMP produced an all in return of 29%, KMR 26%, and KMI 11% on an annualized basis. So that’s looking at it from a current performance perspective. If you look at it from a future of growth perspective, during 2011 we put $2.6 billion into expansion, JVs and acquisitions. And this is the life blood for growing the company in the future.
I think we have tremendous opportunities for future growth in our set of businesses and that opportunity is really pretty diverse in nature. It relates to the continued emergence of natural gas shale plays, together with their associated liquids production. It relates to growth in CO2 demand in the Permian Basin. I’ll talk about that later. We’ve seen an acceleration of that demand over the last several quarters.
It relates to the increasing demand for export coal in our Terminals group. And the further mandates for the use of renewable fuels in both our Terminals and Products group. It also results from the opportunity to serve customers who want to export refined products, primarily diesel on the Gulf Coast, from U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast and to import gasoline into the Northeastern United States as we’ve had a closure of several refineries in that area as all of you know. In fact, I would say that this is the most diverse set of opportunities at any time in Kinder Morgan’s 15-year history.
Now let me talk about each business segment and again, looking at it through this twin perspectives of both present performance and future growth. In our Products Pipeline segment for full year 2011, we had good results on our Cochin pipeline and on Plantation and on our West Coast terminals. This was offset somewhat by lower volumes and revenues on our Pacific System and on Central Florida and our CALNEV pipelines.
To put that in perspective, for the fourth quarter, refined product volumes were down 2.5% compared to fourth quarter of '10. For the full year 2011, the volumes were relatively flat for 2010. We always like to compare that with the EIA numbers on a national basis, and those EIA members showed a decline of 1.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the full year. So getting to the point, our pipelines were a little worse than the EIA average in the fourth quarter, a little bit better for the full year.
If you look at the full year on our pipelines and break it out by commodity, diesel was actually up 0.4%. Jet fuel was up 4.1%, a pretty positive year, and gasoline was off 1.4%. Now still in the Product segment, if you look ahead through the perspective of future growth, we've got a number of important projects in this segment.
One of the most important is our new Eagle Ford crude and condensate line, which will connect the Eagle Ford shale play with the Houston Ship Channel, that’s about a $220 million project. We're under construction. We expect to be in service by July of this year. Connected to that project, we've now announced a $130 million project to build a condensate processing facility, or a splitter, at our Galena Park facility on the Eastern Ship channel, which will be connected to this new Eagle Ford condensate line.
We already have 25,000 barrels per day of capacity being supported by contract with a major oil customer. The operation is expandable to 100,000 barrels. We're actually now filing for the environmental permits at the 50,000 barrel level, which we think is very doable from a demand standpoint, and that would turn this $130 million project into roughly a $160 million project and ultimately as I said, the whole thing is expandable to 100,000 barrels per day. We expect this project to be in service around June of 2014.
We also have a new pipeline also costing about $220 million and that's the Parkway pipeline. This is a 136 miles of 16 inch pipe, and it will run from Norco, Louisiana up to Collins, Mississippi to connect to a storage hub on our plantation system. We do own 50% of that, Bolero owns the other 50%. The initial capacity is 110,000 barrels per day and again it’s also expandable. In this case up to 200,000 barrels per day and we expect to be in service in mid-2013.
Another project that hasn't received a lot of attention, but which is imminent, is our Cochin EP project. We are spending about $30 million to upgrade existing pipelines in order to facilitate the transportation of EP mix from Conway to Sarnia, Ontario and this is providing service to our customer, NOVA. We expect to be in service on April 1 of this year.
And then we have two projects on the West Coast that are fairly significant. One is our Carson 7 project. That's a $77 million project building 7 new tanks at our Carson, California terminal. That’s on schedule and budget. We brought the first 2 tanks online, the remaining 5 tanks will come online late in 2012 and early 2013.
And then our final project is our Travis Air Force Base storage and pipeline project, a little short of $50 million in terms of CapEx, and we expect to finish that project this quarter -- the first quarter of 2012. So that's it on our products’ pipeline segment.
In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment of course 2011 was a good year for us. Our transportation volumes were up 13%. That’s largely a result of our Fayetteville Express project coming online, and strong volumes from the Eagle Ford on our Texas Intrastate. Our sales volumes were up 1% for the year. We had strong performance as a result of the KinderHawk and EagleHawk acquisitions and as a result of FEP and Eagle Ford gathering, and the processing spreads on our Casper-Douglas facility in Wyoming. And we also had increased volumes on Red Cedar. Those positive results were offset in part by weaker performance on our Kinder Morgan Intrastate Gas Transmission and Trailblazers systems.
Now when you look to the future of natural gas, and let me just say that all the projects I am talking about today, and all the numbers we’re talking about today, do not account for any impact from the El Paso acquisition at all. And obviously that’s very relevant for the natural gas segment because when we complete the El Paso acquisition that segment will increase dramatically in size. But without any impact of El Paso and looking at the future at our natural gas facilities we have a number of important projects.
First of all our Eagle Ford gathering joint venture with Copano continues to perform very well, we’re starting new contracts. We're increasing deliveries as Eagle Ford production ramps up. Including our 50% equity interest in this Eagle Ford gathering joint venture, and our 25% interest in EagleHawk field services but excluding the crude and condensate line I referred to earlier, this segment, our natural gas segment has committed approximately $400 million to expansion projects in the Eagle Ford alone.
In the Haynesville, on our gathering system mirror, we've signed a new third party contract and we've added new interconnects and trading services, we ended the year averaging about a Bcf a day as we anticipated we would for 2011.
The third important project during the quarter in the year was we closed on an acquisition SouthTex Treaters for $155 million on November 30. SouthTex designs and manufactures natural gas treating plants. They've removed both CO2 and H2S from the gas system. That’s now part of our Kinder Morgan treating operations and that will allow us to offer our customers the option of owning or leasing this equipment. We think that broadens our earnings capability and broadens the service we can provide to our customers.
Turning to our CO2 operations for 2011, we had a record year. We were right on plan for earnings before DD&A and slightly above plan, if you look at it on a DCF basis. Now we benefited from higher oil and NGL prices. They ran about $6.00 higher than we had in our plan. And we also benefited from growing production at the Katz Field and from some pretty successful efforts to manage and reduce our cost across all of our operations. And that management effort that reduced cost more than offset an overall decline in SACROC and Yates production.
We also set annual production record just barely in our CO2 source fields in Southwest Colorado. The major disappointment was that our Katz volumes did not live up to what we predicted. That’s our new field, which we began flooding at early 2011.
To put that in perspective for you, for the full-year 2011, we averaged about 500 barrels a day. For the fourth quarter, we averaged about 1,000 barrels a day, and so far this quarter we are running at about 1,300 barrels per day. So what we believe is that our response was delayed by about 8 to 12 months beyond what we thought we would get when we originally projected our 2011 budget. But it is now behaving on a ramped up basis as we thought. It’s just coming on later. And when you come to our investor conference later this month, you'll see that we’re projecting around 2,300 barrels to a little over 2,300 barrels of production, on average, per day for 2012. So we intend to see or expect to see a nice ramp up during 2012. 
The big opportunity though in CO2 for the future is satisfying. What’s really turning out to be a very strong demand from our customers in the Permian Basin for more CO2. Now, on previous calls I’ve talked about an opportunity size that would involve adding 200 to 300 million cubic feet a day of production from the source fields that would involve investing. I have said, $1 billion to $1.3 billion of additional capital at good returns.
We now think the opportunity is probably a little bigger than that and maybe as much as 400 to 600 million cubic feet a day of additional need for CO2 in the Permian Basin. That would translate an opportunity into opportunities to spend anywhere from $1 billion on the low side of this, to $2 billion on the upside in accessing more production from our source fields and in moving that to market in the Permian Basin.
Now as we always say at Kinder Morgan, we're only going to do this if we are backed, if that demand is backed by solid contracts from creditworthy companies over extended periods of time and right now that’s looking very good. Tim Bradley will have more to say about that at our investor conference next week but today our board did approve, in part, an important first step in generating this additional CO2. We approved a $255 million project in our Doe Canyon field in Southwest Colorado, which will take production there up from a 105 million cubic feet a day today, to a 170 million cubic feet a day.
That $255 million will be spent over the next several years and will involve both compression and additional wells. So a lot of opportunity here for real growth at very attractive returns backed by long-term contracts.
Turning to our terminals operation, in 2011 we continued to generate strong earnings before DD&A and DCF. I think it's important to note that about 70% of that growth or about $40 million was attributable to organic sources as opposed to acquisitions and I know when we talk about, ""Gee, we think 2% may be a little better in growth from organic sources in Kinder Morgan."" People wonder, ""Well, where does that come from?"" 2% of off 2011 numbers would be $60 million to $70 million and here we had $40 million of growth in the terminals group alone, from organic sources.
Now, where did that growth come from? We had strong growth in coal volumes handled. We've been talking about that export coal story now for several quarter, we were up 33% in terms of coal volumes handled in the fourth quarter. More importantly for the full year we were up 20% versus 2010. And our Pier IX facility in Newport News, Virginia set a record. In that one terminal we handled almost 13 million tons of coal.
Our steel volumes were also positive for the year, up 18% in the fourth quarter, up 10% for the year. On the liquids terminal side, we had good performance at both our enormous Pasadena terminal here on the Houston Ship Channel and in our Carteret facility in New York Harbor.
We also handled 16 million barrels of ethanol in the fourth quarter. That was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our ethanol volumes were up 5%. If you look at Kinder Morgan including the products segment, we still are handling about 30% of all the ethanol used in the United States.
Now in our Terminals Group, we had an unusually large number of new commercial contracts signed, which will lead over the next few years to some pretty important new projects. Our capital budget there for expansion CapEx is over $400 million for 2012 and in fact we have, based on commercial contracts signed specifically in 2011, we now have budgeted over $850 million in CapEx in the terminals projects over the next couple of years ’12 and ’13 and the first quarter of ’14 to be specific on projects that were locked in pursuant to contracts that we’re done during 2011.
So coming back to this perspective of looking at what did we accomplish from a future growth standpoint? The terminals added a tremendous year in 2011. First of all, the BOSTCO project, which is probably the largest single project that we entered into. In December, we purchased TransMontaigne’s 50% interest, so we now own 98% of this $430 million project on the Houston Ship Channel.
And now let me remind you that as we previously said, and TransMontaigne has previously said, we have made that purchase. They do have certain rights to repurchase for a one year period. So between now and January of next year. But right now, we own 98% of the project. This first phase of that project will involve 52 storage tanks with the capacity of 6.6 million barrels. We’re handling residual fuel, distillates, and other black oils. We have terminal service contracts or LOIs for all of that capacity.
Eventually, we see this terminal because of its location and the draft adjacent to this terminal. We see this as an important cog in the ability of Houston Ship Channel refiners to export refined products given the advantageous location and depth of water. The construction on this project started in December of 2011.
Another major project that we announced during 2011 was the Edmonton South Terminal. This is roughly a $210 million project at Edmonton Alberta. It involves building 2.4 million barrels of capacity for storage of crude oil and condensate. It's at our TransMontaigne Terminal, has access right into our TransMontaigne Pipeline that runs across the Rockies and down into Vancouver and Washington State.
We’ll start construction on this in early this year, and we expect to have it in service late in 2013. Now this is another project that anticipate will be scaled up over the next few years. We could eventually, on that site, build up to 6 million barrels in 2 additional phases. What this does for our customers, who are primarily oil sands producers and marketers, is it gives them additional optionality to use the oil sands production as that production expands, and as crude oil pricing and differentials continue to remain extremely volatile as they have over the past several months.
We also will continue to expand our capacity for export coal at both IMT on Mississippi River in Houston, and eventually on some of our terminals on the East Coast. So a lot of opportunities for upside in our Terminals Group over the next few years.
In Kinder Morgan Canada, we had a good year in 2011 as refiners in Washington State wanted access to cheap oil sands production, and the oil sands producers wanted to move more barrels over our dock in Vancouver, British Columbia. We expect that demand growth to continue. For that reason we are in the midst of an open season on an expansion to TransMontaigne. At the customer’s request, we extended that open season until mid-February, and again we will proceed only if we have adequate binding commitments from customers to go forward. But we do see this as a tremendous opportunity in the future.
So all-in-all, we think we had a very good 2011 and we’ve build this set of tremendous opportunities for 2012 and beyond. We expect to declare $4.98 in distribution for 2012 and to have excess coverage on top of that of about $70 million.
In addition, I’ll remind you that we said before the El Paso merger was announced, that we thought for the next several years, we could grow KMP at 5% which would lead to 10% growth at KMI. Post El Paso, we believe that we can grow at 7% at KMP and about 12% at KMI. But it’s important to note that all the numbers I’ve given to you again are pre-El Paso and we’ve well exceeded the 5% and 10% growth numbers that we talked about previously for growth at KMP and KMI respectively.
So we have good current strong cash flow, very good growth opportunities for the future. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Kim."

We're declaring a distribution to",3537,"If you turn to the first page of numbers it's titled The Consolidated Statement of Income. I'm not going to spend much time on this page. But just looking down, about 80% down the page, the declared distribution per unit. We're declaring a distribution today at KMP of $1.16 per unit. That compares to a $1.13 last year, and that’s up $0.03 quarter-to-quarter, or about 3% growth. For the year, we have declared $4.61. That compares to 2010 of $4.40. That’s $0.21 per unit increase, or almost a 5% increase. The $4.61 is also a $0.01 above our 2011 budget.
With that, I’ll turn to the second page of numbers called the contribution by business segments. Looking 4 lines from the bottom, the DCF before certain items for the fourth quarter in 2011 $425 million of DCF before certain items, that compares to 2010 of $366 million, a $59 million increase or about 16%. For the year, 1.5 billion to 5 billion,  that compares to 1.36 billion in 2010, that’s a $165 million increase or about 12% versus our budget. The 1.5 billion to 5 billion, we are up about $11 million versus our budget.
If you look at what that translates into in terms of DCF per unit, that’s a $1.27 per unit, which is about 8.5% growth versus last year for the quarter and for the year $4.68 per unit which is growth of almost 6%.
Our coverage, that was in excess coverage for the quarter of about $37 million. For the year, about $21 million, and versus our budget, we’re about $70 million below our budget with respect to coverage. But let me just give you an overall view versus our budget.
The segments ended up largely inline with their budget, interest was favorable about a little over $25 million. Sustaining CapEx was positive versus our budget about $13 million. So total DCF available for distribution to our Limited Partners and our General Partners were up about $38 million versus our budget.
Our GP, we paid our GP about $27 million more than we budgeted. That was a function of incremental units that we issued during the year, about $5 million primarily associated with KinderHawk, and the $0.01 that we increased the distribution.
So that leaves us with LP DCF versus our budget, about $11 million above our budget. Then we also paid our Limited Partners about $26 million more, again because we increased the distribution above our budget and also because we had incremental units outstanding. And so that leaves us at about $16 million of lower coverage than what we budgeted.
Now if you adjust for a Canadian tax refund that we expected to receive in 2011 that we did not receive in 2011, but we've received notification that we will receive in 2012 and it is not included in our 2012 budget that we'll go through next week. You add back that $6 million, and you adjust for the incremental $0.01 that was not in our budget, that's another roughly $6 million and you are within a few million dollars of our budget on coverage.
With that, looking back up at the lines above the DCF before certain items, you look at booked cash taxes, net $7.9 million in the quarter, $5 million last year, up $2.9 million. For the year $27 million versus $26 million last year, so up about a $1 million. For the year versus our budget, down about $10.9 million, but I think the key here is and what's important is really the cash taxes because all we're doing is adding back the book taxes. So the book taxes have no impact and then subtracting out the cash taxes. Absent the Canadian tax refunds, the cash taxes were on budget for the year.
Express, Endeavor and Eagle Ford contributions, these are adjustments that we make for investments that we have where the cash that we received doesn't track net income plus JV DD&A less our share of sustaining CapEx, $7 million in the quarter, $2 million last year up $5 million, for the 12 months $15 million versus $5 million last year. So up $10 million and up about $8 million over our budget. We received incremental distributions from all three of these investments versus our budget.
Looking at sustaining CapEx, $72 million for the quarter, $58 million in the fourth quarter last year, that's about $14 million increase in sustaining CapEx, $212 million for the year, that compares to $179 million last year, so up about $33 million versus last year. But actually about $13 million positive versus our budget. The $13 million versus our budget really breaks down into 2 pieces. Five is really lower capitalized overheads, basically our capitalized overhead rate is based on our total spending, our total expansion and sustaining capital. Our expansion capital increased significantly, so that rate came down but our sustaining capital was flat. So a lot of it is a function of capitalized overhead versus any changes in the segment spending.
$8 million is associated with the segment spending and that’s really at CO2, about half of that we didn't have to do a power plant, overhaul the turbine for the flat power plant in CO2. And the other half is some non-safety, non-integrity deferrals. 
Now looking up at the segments and seeing what drove the growth, products pipeline, a $161 million in the quarter versus a $171 million last year, or about $10 million down this year. That compares to $694 million for the full year versus $688 million last year, that’s up about $7 million. Products came in about $36 million lower than its budget, or about 5%, and if you cut through it all, it is primarily SFPP. We had some ups and down on you know the different assets within the segment. And SFPP was largely associated with three things. With deferred rate case, rate cases and the lower rates that we implemented there with an adverse decision with respect to UPR right of away cost, so increased right of away cost and then lower volumes than what we budgeted.
Natural gas, in the fourth quarter $290 million versus $243 million a year ago, that’s up $47 million or 19%. For the 12 months, $951 million versus $836 million a year ago, up a $115 million or 14%. Natural gas was about 5% above its budget and that is largely a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, actually the KinderHawk acquisition contributes more than what they were above their budget. And then we have some offsets primarily with some higher integrity spending on the Texas intrastate and lower fuel charges or collections on KMI and Trailblazer. Upstream was also up nicely for the year from higher processing margins and higher gathering volumes.
CO2 in the quarter, $281 million versus $242 million a year ago, up $39 million or 16% for the year, $1.093 billion, that compares to $960 million a year ago or up $133 million or 14%. CO2 was really on its budget. In reality it was slightly below its budget on earnings before DD&A and slightly above its budget on a DCF basis. That primarily was driven by, SACROC was above its budget as a result of higher price and lower OpEx, and that was offset somewhat by lower volumes than what we budgeted. And then Katz and Eastern Shelf had lower volumes than what we budgeted. Yates  and S&T were on their budget.
Terminal Segment, a $184 million in the third quarter, on the fourth quarter, a $173 million a year ago, up $12 million or 7%. For the year, $701 million versus $647 million a year ago, up $55 million or 8%. Terminal was about 2% below its budget. That was a function of higher fuel costs, timing on acquisitions versus our budget. Some of the acquisitions that we did happened later in the year than what we had originally thought. It is lower transload volumes, primarily ethanol in our material handling business, primarily as it lost some market share to unit trains. And then we had a steel mill that we served that was down for an extended period of time.
Kinder Morgan Canada for the quarter, $51 million versus $49 million a year ago, up $2 million or 4%. For the year, a $199 million versus a $182 million a year-ago, up 17% or 9%. For the year, Kinder Morgan Canada was about 3% above its budget, and that was a function of FX, the implementation of a neutral settlement and then higher domestic volumes on our Express Platte pipelines.
Dropping down, about half way down the page to the G&A, which you'll see below the segment earnings contribution. G&A for the quarter, $86 million versus $87 million a year ago, still about a $1 million decrease. For the year, $388 million versus $375 million a year ago, still up about $13 million versus a year ago. The full-year number is up versus last year primarily due to a higher benefit. But it is right on top of our budget.
Interest expense, which is the next line, a $137 million in the quarter, a $132 million a year ago, that is increased expense of about $5 million year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. For the year, it's up about $25 million and versus our budget as I mentioned earlier, it is about $28 million above our budget.
Now dropping down to the certain items, there are a couple that I'll mention to you, most of them are relatively small this quarter, total certain items in the quarter, about $12.5 million, $3.8 million is associated with some higher environmental reserves that we took during the quarter. $5.2 million is associated with market-to-market on our CO2 hedges. Again as you can see in the footnote down there, we continue to recognize those in the quarter as we settle those hedges and don’t mark them to market prior to that time up in the segment.
Insurance deductible casualty losses and reimbursement, that’s associated with a small fire that we had on our Total petcoke facility. For the year, certain items $491 million, the largest certain items, $82 million associated with allocated non-cash compensation. This is a $100 million pool that was paid by our shareholders, but GAAP requires us to allocate these cost to KMP. We've talked about this in our prior quarter. KMP has not and will not pay anything associated with this program. 
Rate case reserves $235 million and we’ve discussed those in prior quarters and the KinderHawk mark to market -- asset write-off of a $167 million, that we've also discussed in prior quarters. 
So with that I will move to the balance sheet. Just 2 items to note on the balance sheet. You can see on cash and cash equivalent, we're up about $280 million from year end 2010 to year end 2011. A reasonable portion of that is associated with Dock premiums that we receive on our Canadian Westridge Dock and this is shippers on our TransMontaigne pipeline to pay a premium in order to get access to that dock and then we actually refund those amounts over a 3- to 5-year timeframe.
The other thing I’d point out is on notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt. The $2.138 billion at 12/31/11 includes $500 million of 9% put bond. The timeframe with respect to the bondholder’s right to put those to us has expired, and so only $50,000 worth of these bonds were put in our K. We will move the balance of that to long-term.
Looking down at the debt balance $12.4 billion at the end of the year that compares to about $11.4 billion at the end of last year, the $979 million increase for the year and about a $153 million increase in the quarter. For the quarter we had uses of a little over $600 million. That was about $290 million in CapEx, about $250 million in acquisitions. The largest acquisitions were SouthTex for $155 million, Watco for $50 million, and then our purchase of TransMontaigne's interest in the BOSTCO terminal $30 million.
Contributions to equity investments was about $75 million, primarily associated with our joint venture in the Eagle Ford with Copano and with our 25% interest in the Eagle Ford with BHP. Equity issuance for the quarter was over $250 million, and that was about 145 million through our KMP at-the-market program, and than 109 on our KMR dividend. 
Working capital was a little bit over 200 million during the quarter. The largest piece of it during the quarter is really accrued interest. We typically paid most of our interest payments comp in the first and the third quarter. The dock premiums, as I mentioned, we’ve receive a fair amount of dock premiums during the fourth quarter. AP and AR was a source of cash of $30 million. We also had excess coverage, as I mentioned earlier, of 37 million, and uses offsetting that, was gas and storage and cash flows overdraft.
For the year the change in debt $979 million. The uses were about $2.76 billion, was about $987 million in CapEx, $1 billion to $1.244 billion in acquisitions. In addition to the ones I mentioned in the quarter. For the year, we also have the KinderHawk acquisition for $912 million, $371 million, and contributions to equity investment, the largest one was the contribution to FEP. We also paid off $77 million, or assumed $77 million of incremental debt when we brought KinderHawk on to our balance sheet. We paid $81 million in CPEC and perk settlement. We issued about $1.42 billion in equity between KMP and KMR and then we settled interest rate swaps, which were a source of cash at $73 million.
We sold a small terminal on the Netherlands, which was a source of $16 million, and the working capital and other items were a source of cash of $271 million. For the year the sources of working capital, primarily the dock premiums, coverage. We also had distributions from equity investments in excess of what we reflect in our DCF and then we had a loan to plantation which they repaid.
That results in a DEBT to EBITDA for the end of the year up 3.6x. On the third quarter call I had said that we would end the year at about 3.7x. We did a little bit better than that given the incremental equity that we issued in November and December that we hadn't contemplated at the end of the third quarter and then also some of the cash that we received associated with the dock premiums.
So, that’s KMP. Looking at KMI, the first page of numbers in your package you’ll see excluding the interim capital transaction, and that relates to a onetime item that we had in 2010. And so we provide this because this is what's going to appear in the 10-K. But we don’t think this is a real way to look at our business, and we'd be happy too if it shows 28% growth for the year, but we think the more appropriate way to look at our business is to adjust for that onetime item in 2010. And so looking at the second page which excludes the ITT, this is what we are going to focus on.
Now with respect to the numbers presented on this page. This is represented on a paid basis. And so what we are looking at for the fourth quarter is what KMI received from KMP in the fourth quarter, based on the dividend that KMP declared for the third quarter of last year. So, we’re looking at, that’s the cash generated and then we're comparing that to the dividend that KMI paid during the fourth quarter, which would be $0.30 and that is in contrast to the dividend that we’re declaring today of $0.31.
Going forward, we will switch to a paid basis in order to be consistent with -- I mean to a declared basis, sorry, in order to be consistent with KMP. But looking at cash available to pay dividends, $243 million in the quarter versus $233 million a year ago, up 20 million or 9%. For the year, 835 million versus 763 million a year ago, or up $72 million or 9%.
The 835 million was the cash available. We also paid out 835 million, which is a $1.18 that was already paid. $1.18, as Rich mentioned earlier, compares to our budget of $1.16 and so we exceeded our budget by $0.02.
Today what we are declaring is $0.31 a share. So, another reason that we’re making the switch from paid basis to declared basis is so that people can see -- so that we can present for people, the numbers that we are basing the dividend that we’re declaring on.
And so, just to switch 2011 to a declared basis, cash available to pay dividend, if you presented it on a declared basis, would be $866 million. Dividends paid, and that includes obviously the $0.31 or dividends declared using the [indiscernible] of excess coverage for the year looking at 2011 on a declared basis. And given the $0.31 that we are declaring today. 
Now looking at what drove the growth in the year, if you look up about 4 lines from the top of the page, total KMP distributions to us, $351 million in the quarter versus $315 million last year, $36 million increase or 11%. For the year $1.349 billion versus $1.202 billion a year ago, a $148 million increase or a 12% increase. That’s the $1.349 billion is about $19 million over our budget, primarily driven by the incremental amount that we received on the GP interest as a function of more units outstanding versus our budgets and the $0.01 increase in the distribution.
NGPL, the next line item, NGPL cash available for distribution to us. You'll see that we switched this from the prior quarter when we previously showed dividends paid to us given that we owed only 20% of this investment, we can't control what they declare or what they dividend out. But the cash is there. So what we're presenting is net income, actually pretax income plus DD&A, less cash taxes less sustaining cash backs. So we are presenting the cash that is actually generated by this entity given that we can’t control the dividends, $7.6 million in the quarter versus 0 last year, up $10.6 million for the year, $30.3 million versus $34.7 million a year ago, down $4.4 million and down about $3 million versus our budget. And that's just a function of lower transport margins and LPS on GPL.
G&A expense, basically up $3.5 million versus the fourth quarter last year, up $12.8 million versus for a year ago, versus a year ago and within about $2 million of our budget. Interest expense, $5.6 million in the quarter versus $5 million a year ago, basically flat, up slightly, which has to do with slightly higher balance, and for the year up $8.3 million and slightly positive versus our budget.
Cash taxes, $22.7 million, higher in the quarter versus a year ago and $49.7 million higher for the year right on top of our budget. They are higher versus a year ago due to the higher income.
So with that for KMI, I will turn to the balance sheet. Looking at KMI’s debt on the balance sheet, $3.236 billion as of 12/31/11 versus $3.195 billion versus at 12/31/10, so up about $41 million for the year, up $44 million for the quarter. And let me just go through a quick reconciliation on that.
For the quarter, we had $243 million available to pay dividends. We paid dividends of $212 million. We also had a use of cash to pay El Paso financing fees of $56 million and then we had some items associated within GPL that were about $18 million. The metrics that we show versus the distributions that we actually received were about $9 million lower. And then NGPL actually reimbursed that from G&A in early January versus by the end of the year.
For the year, $41 million increase in debt, $835 million in cash available to pay dividends. $771 million in dividends paid. $64 million went out on a $100 million pool, when you add the $771 million of the dividends and the $64 million, that’s $835 million so that’s the $835 million that we referred to as paying in dividends, because our shareholders actually paid for the $100 million bonus pool.
The MBO settlement was a positive $29 million after-tax. KMR, which we elected not to sell at the end of the year, you need to subtract $46 million, because we include that benefit in our metric, $56 million went out on the El Paso financing fees. We got about $69 million in tax refunds that were associated with onetime items. And then the $18 million that I mentioned on NGPL were the same for the year as they were in the quarter. That leaves us at 2.4x on debt to distribution received. So a very strong balance sheet."

And we think eventually, we will be able to expand that with a second dock and with additional tank and again eventually we think that would connect back to our Galena Park and Pasadena terminals and we will actually be able to move a variety of products down there. Again, I think I’ve said this before, but I know I’ve said it earlier today, we believe that in the Gulf Coast, you have significant additional U.S. refining capacity being built. There will not be a demand for all of that production and we think that a good bit of it, particularly diesel will actually get exported particularly to South America, and if you believe that, Houston and Port Arthur and Beaumont are ideal areas to structure some facility to handle export volumes and that’s essentially what we’re doing. On the other hand, we’ve done some major expansions on our Carteret facility, all subject to long-term contracts in New York Harbor. While that capacity is being utilized by our customers who are actually importing primarily gasoline into the U.S. Northeast to replace volumes that are no longer there because refineries in the Northeast were closed. So long-term, we think BOSTCO could become a much larger facility, I don’t think Jeff is in the room, but we have a lot of excess acreage here that allows us to build out significant additional storage beyond the 6.6 million barrels."

And so there is a lot of different opportunities on Cochin or doing something by converting Pony I think would be the two most likely ways we would take advantage of it. But clearly, the demand there is a question of what’s the best way to solve it and that’s where we’re looking at right now."

And a lot of other opportunities. But you’re right, I mean the idea will be to maximize the diversity of the utilization of that condensate coming in from the Eagle Ford. So we think it’s -- and I think the time has come and again, we are actually applying this month for our environmental permits and we're doing at 50,000 barrels per day because we think that’s probably where we'll end up and then we'll have the expandability up to a 100,000 barrels a day. I think it’s kind of unlikely we'll be at there -- be at that point at the startup that we will have, fairly cheap or fairly reasonable expandability up to 100,000 barrels a day."

Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the first quarter analyst call. We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc. or KMI and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners or KMP. We'll talk about first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year and beyond.",2967,"Okay. Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the first quarter analyst call. We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc. or KMI and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners or KMP. We'll talk about first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give an overview. Kim Dang our CFO, will give a detailed financial results and then both Steve and I and others at the management team will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.
Let me start with KMI. And it's a very simple story. It begins and ends with cash flow, and we get 99% of our cash from our GP and LP interest in KMP. We pay our taxes on that, we be the interest on a relatively low amount of debt that we have and we distribute the balance to the KMI shareholders in the form of dividends. The metric that we think is the most important here is cash available to pay dividends, and for the first quarter of 2012, that number was $303 million. That's up 14% from the $267 million in quarter 1 of 2011, and slightly ahead of our budget. We have increased the quarterly dividend of $0.32 a share or $1.28 annualized, by way of comparison, that's an increase of 10% from the $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011. As we said previously, we expect to declare dividends of at least $1.35 per share for full-year 2012, and that's about the impact of the El Paso merger, which should increase our cash available for dividends on a post closing basis. Now let me give you an update on the El Paso acquisition because I know that's a subject that everybody's interested in, and I'll make several points.
First, as we said all along, we expect the acquisition to be nicely accretive to KMI. As a result of that and the normal growth rate that we have, KMI expects its dividends per share to grow at an average annual rate of 12.5% through 2015 from its budgeted 2011 dividend per share of $1.16. Secondly, one of the things we set out to do early on was to make sure that we are marching along on the integration efforts to put these 2 great companies together. That's proceeded very much on schedule. Enormous effort by lots of people on both the Kinder Morgan and the El Paso side. We are now far enough along but we're very confident that we will meet or exceed the $350 million per year target in cost savings and other synergies that we pegged at the beginning of the process.
Third point is, as you all know, shareholders of both companies have overwhelmingly approved a merger. Forward point is that we, as promised, the beginning of the process, have entered into a definitive agreement to sell El Paso's ENP business for approximately $7.15 billion to a group led by Apollo Global Management. We expect to close that transaction at about the same time as the merger closes. And importantly we expect El Paso's NOL carry forwards to largely offset any taxes from the sale, and therefore, we'll be able to use virtually the entire proceeds to reduce the debt, which KMI incurred for the cash portion of the merger consideration.
The next point is that we have, as you know reached agreement with the FTC staff to divest certain KMP assets as a necessary step to receive regulatory approval of the transaction. Subject to final approval by the commission, we've agreed to sell Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, our Trailblazer system, certain Wyoming processing and treating facilities and our 50% interest in the REX pipeline. We expect to close that sale in the third quarter of 2012.
The final point I would make is with regard to drop downs. We intend to offer or drop-down El Paso assets to KMP to replace the divested assets, all those divested assets I mentioned belong to KMP, and we expect to offer to KMP all of Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a portion of El Paso Natural Gas. We hope to close that transaction or drop-down contemporaneously with the close of the divestiture of the KMP assets, which again we believe will incur in the third quarter this year. We expect the combination of the divestiture and the drop downs will be neutral to KMP's distribution per unit in 2012, and accretive to KMP's distribution per unit thereafter. El Paso also has offered to sell the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate Gas and all those Cheyenne Plains pipeline to El Paso Pipeline Partners, obviously, subject to final approval of both the El Paso and EPB boards. We expect that drop-down to close contemporaneously with the close of the KMI El Paso transaction, and we expect it to be immediately accretive to the distribution per unit at El Paso Pipeline Partners. So that's an update on the El Paso situation. Now let me turn to KMP.
And clearly, all the numbers at KMP that we're talking about now are pre the El Paso merger. At KMP, we've said so many times, the real important metric there is distributable cash flow per unit. And for the first quarter this year, it's $1.37 per unit versus $1.21 a year ago or up 13% and overall, as I'll go through, I think we had a very nice quarter at KMP. 4 of our 5 business segments outperformed the same quarter in 2011. The only exception to that was the Products Pipeline group, which was down slightly, primarily due to lower tariffs as a result of the prior FERC decision and FERC decision 5118 and settlements with customers that we made since the first quarter of last year. We anticipated this and actually, this segment is mildly positive to plan for the first quarter. But during the last segment, it's pretty apparent to me that refined products volumes are clearly down from a year ago but consistent with the EIA. You'll see from our volume numbers attached to our release for the quarter, overall refined products at Kinder Morgan are down 1.6%. Now that compares to the EIA numbers I recently released of 2.7% negative. But I think you have to adjust our 1.6% to account for the leap year, and if you do that, we're actually 2.7% also. Now frankly, I don't expect any major increase in volumes in the foreseeable future at our -- in terms of refined products due to a number of industry-wide factors. The growth in this segment is going to come from 4, 5 other factors that we think are very important, and we have examples of all of these concepts in play right now. The first is we're clearly increasing the amount of biodiesel and ethanol that we're handling, that's a tremendous increase of a relatively small base of biodiesel I might add, in the first quarter this year. We also see a lot of opportunities for this segment in the shale plays. Obviously, 2 examples of that are the Kinder Morgan crude and condensate line that will take Eagle Ford volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale play up to the Houston Ship Channel. And once there, another example of what we can do is the fractionator that we now believe will probably start out at around 50,000 barrels per day, and we will build that fractionator to help handle some of the condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford. Another opportunity for this segment is selected, targeted expansions for particular customers. Probably the best example of that is the Parkway project, about a $220 million pipeline that will connect a refinery in southern Louisiana to the mainline Plantation system in southern Mississippi. That's going along on schedule, and that's a good new project for us. And then finally, we have a lot of associated Terminals with our Products Pipeline segment, and a lot of those Terminals have expansion capabilities and possibilities. Best example of that probably is our Carson 7 project in Los Angeles, where we're building 7 new tanks, 2 are already online, the rest will come online at the end of 2012 and early 2013. All of those tanks are under long-term agreements with our customers. So while we don't expect the volumes run through our Products Pipeline in terms of refined products to increase, we do expect to still continue to be able to grow that segment due to these other factors.
Now turning to our Natural Gas segment, I think the story here is no secret to any of you on this call. There's less activity in the dry gas place, and there's more activity in the richer place. So, for example ask, Kim will take you through the numbers, KinderHawk is not seeing the volumes we would've thought we would've seen in our budget year-to-date. On the other hand, it's still above the acquisition plan numbers that we had when we made this acquisition of the second half in the middle of 2011. On the other hand, in places like the Eagle Ford, we see activity continuing to ratchet up. For example in the Eagle Ford, we have a joint venture with BHP. That rig count in drilling activity is increasing rapidly, and we think it will continue to increase throughout 2012 and certainly beyond. Our Treating business is also performed very well, particularly the part of it that manufacturers facilities for sale, known as the SouthTex operation, which we bought last December. Again, we're benefiting the largely from activity in shale plays like the Eagle Ford.
And then finally, we think we're -- in the Natural Gas segment, building the infrastructure of the future as we've said so many times, particularly with the El Paso merger. We're handling the product that we think is going to be really the base load fossil fuel product for America for the next several decades. As we said so many times, it's clean, it's cheap and it's domestic. We think there'll be a lot of additional opportunities that will come and play as a result of having the size of network that we certainly will have after the El Paso acquisition. But one opportunity right now that we see even pre the El Paso merger is as we see these opportunities for liquefaction facilities to be built along the Gulf Coast, we have extraordinarily good connectivity to those plays that would be providing the natural gas to be liquefied and to the terminals where the liquification will be done, for example the Cheniere project outside of the Charles. So we will take advantage of our interconnecting pipelines if and when these projects get built.
Turning to our CO2 segment, I think the story there in the first quarter, the pluses were high prices from a WTI standpoint and record NGL production during the quarter. If you look at the oil volumes, we have a combination. SACROC was down to last year, as we expected. Yates was a mild positive to our plan, down a bit from last year. Katz obviously, very positive to last year and ramping up significantly as we go forward. And if you put all that together, we're down about 900 barrels per day from where we were a year ago or about 3%. Overall, the segments about on plan for the quarter in terms of bottom line performance, and we expect it to be on plan for the year. But the really big story for the future I think in our CO2 segment is the growth in additional CO2 sales. And I think one of the most significant stories at Kinder Morgan in the first quarter this year was the fact that our CO2 segment signed contracts for 2.1 trillion cubic feet of new CO2 to be supplied to various customers in the Permian Basin. We think these are done at good prices to us and would allow us to earn a decent return on the capital we will invest, and they're all long term, with an average life of 16 years. They will peak, if you look at this 2.1 TCF and how it ramps up, it will peak at an additional 450 million cubic feet a day in the peak years of this contracts. And that's significant when you think that right now, we're at about 1.25 billion cubic feet a day. In order to supply these additional CO2 contracts, and we think we will have additional contracts signed in the future, we're going to work at expanding our source fields to accommodate that increased demand. We've already approved and talked about before the roughly $250 million that we're spending in Southwest Colorado. We expect just the Doe Canyon facility that we have, we expect to spend some plays in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion eventually and expanding our production capabilities and our network capacity if the kind of demand we've experienced now continues for the future, and we think it will. So all put, we're talking about a great growth opportunity here for CO2 that's a very predictable return over a long period of time and of course, that will involve, as part of this, the development of our new St. John's field that we just closed on early in the first quarter, which is on the Arizona and New Mexico Border. So good future for CO2, particularly in the supply of CO2 to our customers.
On our Terminals side, just had an extraordinary quarter, and if you just look up and other line and you have to be SBR, very pleased with the performance. We had growth on both the liquids side and the bulk side just to give you a few numbers. Our throughput on the liquids side was up by 9% compared to the first quarter of '11. Our tonnage on the bulk side was up by 6%. Some of the drivers on the bulk side -- we had a tremendous ramp-up in demand for export coal. So even though we had a downturn in some of our domestic coal handling as you would imagine, given the situation across the country and the warm winter, nevertheless, the total coal volumes were up by 5% driven largely by record export quantities. Our steel volumes were up 16% in the first quarter of '12 compared to '11.
If you look at the future, we've now authorized and have in progress $1.2 billion worth of capital expenditures in our Terminals group. Those are projects that are in progress that have been approved by our board. That number that we also shared with you, those of you who were present at our Analyst Day back in January. At that time, it was $860 million. So we've increased by $350 million or so just in the last 3 months since we had our analyst conference. What's driving a lot of this is the Coal Export business, and when we finish the projects that we've authorized now, we will then have increased our capacity to handle export coal to about 45 million tons per year. Now when you think that the whole export coal market is someplace between -- there's a lot of differences on this, but most people think it will settle in someplace between 110 million to 150 million tons a year, we're handling, and we'll be handling a very significant part of that.
Then on the liquids side, the main projects there are the big BOSTCO terminal on the ship channels and our large Edmonton South terminal at the beginning of Trans Mountain in Edmonton, Alberta. So great potential for growth in the Terminals segment for years to come. During the, they have solid performance in the first quarter. We're seeing really good demand from both Washington state and across the dock in Vancouver. We were hampered slightly the first quarter by pressure restriction on Trans Mountain, and that was listed on March 16. So that will not be an issue the rest of the year. But the big news in terms of our Canadian operations is the Trans Mountain expansion. There, we received and we released all this earlier, we received binding bids for 660,000 barrels per day for 20-year contracts. So we had originally, as you may recall, thought that we have the potential to upsize Trans Mountain, which currently has a capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day. Our original thought is we could go from 300,000 to 600,000 barrels per day. Given the high volume of nominations that came in, we've decided to upsize the project to go to 850,000 barrels a day or a net increase of 550,000 barrels over the current capacity. That drove an increase in project cost to our current estimate of about $5 billion, up from the $3.8 billion that we had estimated when we were talking about expanding this pipeline to 600,000 barrels per day.
Obviously we have to get regulatory approval from the NEP. We expect to have this pipeline expansion in service in 2017. We think that this is a very important development for our Canadian oil-sands producer customers and their customers. We think it serves as the real means to get more of the oil sands production at the West Coast of Canada and from there, either go into Washington state or across the water. So a lot is happening. We think it's a great time to be in the Midstream Energy business, and look forward to a very strong year, and look forward to closing the El Paso merger. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

At the bottom, you could see the declared distribution, $1.20 to the first quarter of '12. That's consistent with our budget and about 5% above what we declared in the first quarter of last year. The only other thing I'd point out in this stage is the assets which are subject to the FTC staff agreement have been classified as discontinued operation, consistent with GAAP. And so you can see the income from discontinued operation and then also the noncash loss on remeasurement there of $322 million.
Going to the next page, I'd point out that the income from these assets, we have included in our Bcf calculation. We did not pull that out of our DCF calculation. As Rich mentioned, we expect to replace these assets with the drop-down such that KMP, on a coverage basis, or a DCF basis, would be neutral for the year.
Looking at the second page, all the way to the bottom, as Rich mentioned, $1.37 in DCF per unit in the first quarter. That's up $0.16 or 13% versus last year. We are on budget for the quarter and on budget for the full year. To lines above that, DCF before certain items, which is effectively the total cash available to the limited partners, $462 million in the quarter, that's up $80 million or 21% from since last -- first of last year. We are on budget for the quarter and on budget for the year.
Given that, as the DCF per unit available and the declared distribution of $1.20, that gives us coverage of $58 million in the quarter. As we said at the time, at the analyst conference that we presented the budget, we expect to have excess coverage in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, and we would expect to have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter. And so, next quarter when we present, we would not expect to have coverage. But again, we will have coverage for the full year.
Looking up that the total segment of earnings before DD&A, $1.29 billion in the first quarter of this year, that's up $150 million or 17% versus last year. On Products Pipelines, as Rich mentioned, we're down $4 million, primarily as a result of regulatory agreements. For the full year, I mean, for the quarter, are slightly ahead of our budget primarily because of some better volumes on Cochin. And for the full year, we expect to end -- we expect Product Pipeline to end on budget.
Natural Gas is up $56 million for the quarter or 25%. And that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, the higher contractual volumes on FEP and then the Treating acquisition and in addition, better results than we expected from that treating acquisition that we referred to as SouthTex. In the quarter, Natural Gas is about 3% below their budget. And for the full year, we expect them to end about 2% below their budget. As Rich mentioned, as drilling has shifted from the dry basin to the richer areas, we have seen some volume impact on our KinderHawk acquisition. And that is really what is causing natural gas to be below budget for the year.
On CO2, cut $79 million in the quarter or 31%. As Rich mentioned, higher oil price and higher NGL volumes are driving that. They were slightly below planned in the quarter, and that was a function of we were a little bit -- we were below budget on SACROC volumes. That would somewhat offset by the help that we got on price. But the help on price is not as much as what you would expect. We've outlined our metrics, which is about $6 million in DCF or $1 change in the price of oil. The reason is not as much as you would expect big is because NGL prices got hit.
For the full year, we expect that CO2 will be on its budget. We expect that the SACROC volumes will recover and that they will only end at a couple hundred barrels below their project.
Terminals is up $70 million for the quarter or about 10%. They are on budget for the quarter, and we expect that they will meet or exceed their budget for the full year. KMP is up $2 million in the quarter. They are on budget for the quarter, and we expect that they will come in slightly below their budget for the full year on an earnings before DD&A basis. But if you look at that on a DCF basis, we would expect to say they meet their budget for the year.
If you drop down to the General and Administrative Line, which is about is in the middle of the page, $108 million for the quarter, that's $8 million higher than last year. It's a few million higher than our budget, but we actually -- for the quarter, but we actually expect for the full year that we will do a little bit better than our budget, meaning a lower G&A expenses than our budget. The next line, interest expense, is up $7 million in the quarter. It's actually slightly favorable in the quarter to our budget primarily because our balance at the end of last year came in a little bit lower than what we budgeted for the full year. We expect to be positive on interest expense and that's more a function of lower rates.
The last thing I'll mention on this page is sustaining CapEx. Sustaining CapEx in the quarter was $44 million, up $8 million versus last year. It is actually a positive versus our budget, and we expect that it'll be a positive 3% or 4% for the full year.
And I'm turning to the balance sheet. Just from a high-level, if you look at the balance sheet, you can see there's a decrease in total assets. And basically, what's happening on the asset side of the ledger that you're seeing that right outcome through there. In addition, we're moving the discontinued operations, again, the assets that are subject to the SEC agreement to asset held for sale. So you see movements out of PP&E investments to goodwill into other current assets. And then the other thing as you see every quarter happening on the asset side of the balance sheet is just the investments that we are making and the spending in CapEx.
On the liability side of the balance sheet, the big bets are really in the debt, which I'll reconcile in a minute and then the value of interest rate swaps, which just moved with the forward curve for interest. We ended the quarter with at $12.556 billion of debt. That's up $168 million from the end of the year. And just to reconcile that $168 million, we spent over a little bit over $300 million on expansion CapEx, about $30 million on acquisitions. That was our CO2 St. John's acquisition. About $49 million was contributed to equity investments, and then we issued about $239 million in equity, about $100.5 million through the KMP aftermarket and then the KMR dividend was about $114 million. We had coverage of about $58 million, as I mentioned earlier, and then we have working capital items that were about a negative $77 million. And the 2 big pieces are the working capital interest was the use of working capital because the most -- our most significant interest payments are in the first quarter and in the third quarter. And then also, we purchased some inventory in our Transmix business, as we took over a contract from Shell. Those 2 items were offset by positive source of the working capital on margin and taxes and then AP and AR. So where that leads us in terms of debt to EBITDA for the quarter is at 3.5x, which is an improvement over 12/31, that was at 3.6x. With that, I'll move to KMI.
The first page of the numbers in KMI is the cash available to pay dividends. Rich mentioned we generated $303 million in cash available to pay dividends in the quarter. That is on our budget, and $36 million or 14% above last year. And as you look up at the top, that's driven primarily by the GP interest in KMP, which is up $41 million or 14% from last year. Based on declared dividends of $0.32, we have coverage for the quarter of $76 million. Similar to KMP -- on KMI, we expect that we have coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and for the full year, and that we would have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter. And that KMI, that's primarily a function of the timing of interest and tax payments.
For the full year, we expect to be slightly ahead of our budget of $985 million in cash available to pay dividends. And that $985 million, as we said at budget time, does not include any impact from the acquisition of El Paso.
The income statement, which is our next page at KMR. Similar to KMP, you can see the discontinued operations in the middle of the page. Again, the asset to the FTC agreement was classified as discontinued ops. The number is different here because KMI has a different basis KMR record KMP's assets at a different level than where KMP reports on. That was a function of the purchase accounting that was done at the time of the 2007 NPL.
Just so that people can understand what's going on. The -- at KMI, on the balance sheet, again, you see the same thing happening on the asset side of the balance sheet that I just went through with respect to KMP. If you look down at KMI step, we ended at $3.21 billion of debt, and that's down $26 million towards the end of the year. That change in debt, $26 million, let me reconcile that for you quickly. Our cash available for dividends that I just went over was $303 million. That is based on the dividend declared by KMP. So what was received from KMP during the quarter was about $19 million lower than that. So you take off that $19 million. KMR, we did not choose to sell the KMR shares at this time, so that's a negative 17 coming out of that $303 million. We made a pension contribution of $20 million, and we paid dividends of $220 million. And that should get you to the $26 million change in the debt. The debt to cash available to muted at 2.2x, and that obviously, that's an improvement from the end of last year when we ended at 2.3x. That's it."

And we would expect that dividend to be higher than $1.35. We said that consistently since the time that we announced the merger. And that higher dividend than $1.35 will certainly take into account the additional 300 million plus shares that the we will be putting out. Did that answer the question ?"

Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the first quarter analyst call. We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., or KMI; and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, or KMP. We'll be talking about first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year and",2985,"Okay. Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the first quarter analyst call. We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., or KMI; and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, or KMP. We'll be talking about first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give an overview. Kim Dang, our CFO, will give the detailed financial results and then Park, Steve and I and others at the management team will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.
Let me start with KMI. And it's a very simple story. It begins and ends with cash flow, and we get 99% of our cash from our GP and LP interest in KMP. We pay our taxes on that. We pay the interest on a relatively low amount of debt that we have, and we distribute the balance to the KMI shareholders in the form of dividends. The metric that we think is the most important here is cash available to pay dividends, and for the first quarter of 2012, that number was $303 million. That's up 14% from the $267 million in quarter 1 of 2011 and slightly ahead of our budget. We have increased the quarterly dividend of $0.32 a share, or $1.28 annualized, by way of comparison. That's an increase of 10% from the $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011. As we said previously, we expect to declare dividends of at least $1.35 per share for full year 2012, and that's without the impact of the El Paso merger, which should increase our cash available for dividends on a post-closing basis. 
Now let me give you an update on the El Paso acquisition because I know that's a subject that everybody's interested in, and I'll make several points.
First, as we've said all along, we expect the acquisition to be nicely accretive to KMI. As a result of that and the normal growth rate that we have, KMI expects its dividends per share to grow at an average annual rate of 12.5% through 2015 from its budgeted 2011 dividend per share of $1.16. 
Secondly, one of the things we set out to do early on was to make sure that we are marching along on the integration efforts to put these 2 great companies together. That's proceeded very much on schedule. Enormous effort by lots of people on both the Kinder Morgan and the El Paso side. We are now far enough along, but we're very confident that we will meet or exceed the $350 million per year target in cost savings and other synergies that we pegged at the beginning of the process.
Third point is, as you all know, shareholders of both companies have overwhelmingly approved the merger. Forward point is that we, as promised, at the beginning of the process, have entered into a definitive agreement to sell El Paso's E&P business for approximately $7.15 billion to a group led by Apollo Global Management. We expect to close that transaction at about the same time as the merger closes. And importantly, we expect El Paso's NOL carryforwards to largely offset any taxes from the sale, and therefore, we'll be able to use virtually the entire proceeds to reduce the debt, which KMI incurred for the cash portion of the merger consideration.
Next point is that we have, as you know, reached agreement with the FTC staff to divest certain KMP assets as a necessary step to receive regulatory approval of the transaction. Subject to final approval by the commission, we've agreed to sell Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, our Trailblazer system, certain Wyoming processing and treating facilities and our 50% interest in the REX pipeline. We expect to close that sale in the third quarter of 2012.
The final point I would make is with regard to dropdowns. We intend to offer or drop down El Paso assets to KMP to replace the divested assets. All those divested assets I mentioned belong to KMP, and we expect to offer to KMP all of Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a portion of El Paso Natural Gas. We hope to close that transaction or drop down contemporaneously with the close of the divestiture of the KMP assets, which, again, we believe will occur in the third quarter of this year. We expect the combination of the divestiture and the dropdowns will be neutral to KMP's distribution per unit in 2012, and accretive to KMP's distribution per unit thereafter. El Paso also has offered to sell the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate Gas and all of Cheyenne Plains Pipeline to El Paso Pipeline Partners, obviously, subject to final approval of both the El Paso and EPB boards. We expect that dropdown to close contemporaneously with the close of the KMI-El Paso transaction, and we expect it to be immediately accretive to the distribution per unit at El Paso Pipeline Partners. So that's an update on the El Paso situation. Now let me turn to KMP.
And clearly, all the numbers at KMP that we're talking about now are pre the El Paso merger. At KMP, as we've said so many times, the real important metric there is distributable cash flow per unit. And for the first quarter of this year, it's $1.37 per unit versus $1.21 a year ago or up 13%. And overall, as I'll go through, I think we had a very nice quarter at KMP. 4 of our 5 business segments outperformed the same quarter in 2011, the only exception to that was the Products Pipeline group, which was down slightly, primarily due to lower tariffs as a result of the prior FERC decision and FERC decision 511-A and settlements with customers that we made since the first quarter of last year. We anticipated this, and actually, this segment is mildly positive to plan for the first quarter. 
But turning to that segment, it's pretty apparent to me that refined products volumes are clearly down from 1 year ago, but consistent with the EIA. You'll see from our volume numbers attached to our release for the quarter, overall refined products at Kinder Morgan are down 1.6%. Now that compares to the EIA numbers I recently released of 2.7% negative. But I think you have to adjust our 1.6% to account for the leap year. And if you do that, we're actually 2.7% also. Now frankly, I don't expect any measurable increase in volumes in the foreseeable future at our -- in our -- in terms of refined products due to a number of industry-wide factors. The growth in this segment is going to come from 4, 5 other factors that we think are very important, and we have examples of all of these concepts in play right now. The first is we're clearly increasing the amount of biodiesel and ethanol that we're handling, and their tremendous increase off a relatively small base on the biodiesel, I might add, in the first quarter of this year. We also see a lot of opportunities for this segment in the shale plays. Obviously, 2 examples of that are the Kinder Morgan crude and condensate line that will take Eagle Ford volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale play up to the Houston Ship Channel. And once there, another example of what we can do is the fractionator that we now believe will probably start out at around 50,000 barrels per day, and we will build that fractionator to help handle some of the condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford. 
Another opportunity for this segment is selected, targeted expansions for particular customers. Probably the best example of that is the Parkway project, about a $220 million pipeline that will connect a refinery in Southern Louisiana to the mainline Plantation system in Southern Mississippi. That's going along on schedule, and that's a good new project for us. 
And then finally, we have a lot of associated terminals with our Products Pipeline segment, and a lot of those terminals have expansion capabilities and possibilities. Best example of that, probably, is our Carson 7 project in Los Angeles, where we're building 7 new tanks, 2 are already online, the rest will come online at the end of 2012 and early 2013. All of those tanks are under long-term agreements with our customers. So while we don't expect the volumes run through our Products Pipeline in terms of refined products to increase, we do expect to still continue to be able to grow that segment due to these other factors.
Now turning to our Natural Gas segment, I think the story here is that no secret to any of you on this call. There's less activity in the dry gas plays, and there's more activity in the richer plays. So for example, as Kim will take you through the numbers, KinderHawk is not seeing the volumes we would have thought we would have seen in our budget year-to-date. On the other hand, it's still above the acquisition plan numbers that we had when we made this acquisition of the second half in the middle of 2011. On the other hand, in places like the Eagle Ford, we see activity continuing to ratchet up. For example, in the Eagle Ford, we have a joint venture with BHP. That rig count in drilling activity is increasing rapidly, and we think it will continue to increase throughout 2012 and certainly beyond. Our Treating business has also performed very well, particularly the part of it that manufacturers facilities for sale, known as the SouthTex operation, which we bought last December. Again, we're benefiting largely from activity in shale plays like the Eagle Ford.
And then finally, we think we're, in the Natural Gas segment, building the infrastructure of the future as we've said so many times, particularly with the El Paso merger. We're handling the product that we think is going to be really the base load fossil fuel product for America for the next several decades. As we said so many times, it's clean, it's cheap and it's domestic. We think there will be a lot of additional opportunities that will come in play as a result of having the size of network that we certainly will have after the El Paso acquisition. But one opportunity right now that we see, even pre the El Paso merger, is as we see these opportunities for liquefaction facilities to be built along the Gulf Coast, we have extraordinarily good connectivity to those plays that would be providing the natural gas to be liquefied and to the terminals where the liquification would be done, for example, the Cheniere project outside of Lake Charles. So we will make -- take advantage of our interconnecting pipelines if and when these projects get built.
Turning to our CO2 segment, I think the story there in the first quarter, the pluses were high prices from a WTI standpoint and record NGL production during the quarter. If you look at the oil volumes, we had a combination. SACROC was down to last year, as we expected. Yates was a mild positive to our plan, down a bit from last year. Katz, obviously, very positive to last year and ramping up significantly as we go forward. And if you put all that together, we're down about 900 barrels per day from where we were 1 year ago or about 3%. Overall, the segment's about on plan for the quarter in terms of bottom line performance, and we expect it to be on plan for the year. But the really big story for the future, I think, in our CO2 segment is the growth in additional CO2 sales. And I think one of the most significant stories at Kinder Morgan in the first quarter this year was the fact that our CO2 segment signed contracts for 2.1 trillion cubic feet of new CO2 to be supplied to various customers in the Permian Basin. We think these are done at good prices to us and allow us to earn a decent return on the capital we will invest, and they're all long term, with an average life of 16 years. They will peak, if you look at this 2.1 TCF and how it ramps up, it will peak at an additional 450 million cubic feet a day in the peak years of these contracts. And that's significant when you think that right now, we're at about 1.25 billion cubic feet a day. In order to supply these additional CO2 contracts, and we think we will have additional contracts signed in the future, we're going to work at expanding our source fields to accommodate that increased demand. We've already approved and talked about before the roughly $250 million that we're spending in Southwest Colorado. We expect it and that's just at the Doe Canyon facility that we have. We expect to spend someplace in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion eventually and expanding our production capabilities and our network capacity if the kind of demand we've experienced now continues for the future, and we think it will. So all put, we're talking about a great growth opportunity here for CO2 that's a very predictable return over a long period of time, and of course, that will involve, as part of this, the development of our new St. John's field that we just closed on early in the first quarter, which is on the Arizona and New Mexico border. So good future for CO2, particularly in the supply of CO2 to our customers.
On our Terminals side, just had an extraordinary quarter and you just look at it up and down the line and you have to be as we are, very pleased with the performance. We had growth on both the liquids side and the bulk side, just to give you a few numbers. Our throughput on the liquids side was up by 9% compared to the first quarter of '11. Our tonnage on the bulk side was up by 6%. Some of the drivers on the bulk side, we had a tremendous ramp-up in demand for export coal. So even though we had a downturn in some of our domestic coal handling as you would imagine, given the situation across the country and the warm winter, nevertheless, the total coal volumes were up by 5%, driven largely by record export quantities. Our steel volumes were up 16% in the first quarter of '12 compared to '11.
If you look at the future, we've now authorized and have in progress $1.2 billion worth of capital expenditures in our Terminals group. Those are projects that are in progress. They've been approved by our board. That number that we also shared with you, those of you who were present at our Analyst Day back in January. At that time, it was $860 million. So we've increased by $350 million or so just in the last 3 months since we had our analyst conference. What's driving a lot of this is the coal export business. And when we finish the projects that we've authorized now, we will have increased our capacity to handle export coal to about 45 million tons per year. Now when you think that the whole export coal market is someplace between -- there's a lot of differences on this, but most people think it will settle in someplace between 110 million and 150 million tons a year, but we're handling -- will be handling a very significant part of that.
Then on the liquids side, the main projects there are the big BOSTCO terminal on the ship channel and our large Edmonton South terminal at the beginning of Trans Mountain in Edmonton, Alberta. So great potential for growth in the Terminals segment for years to come. 
Turning to Canada, they have solid performance in the first quarter. We're seeing really good demand from both Washington State and across the dock in Vancouver. We were hampered slightly in the first quarter by pressure restriction on Trans Mountain and that was lifted on March 16, so that will not be an issue the rest of the year. But the big news in terms of our Canadian operations is the Trans Mountain expansion. There, we received -- and we released all this earlier, we received binding bids for 660,000 barrels per day for 20-year contracts. So we had originally, as you may recall, thought that we have the potential to upsize Trans Mountain, which currently has a capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day. Our original thought was we could go from 300,000 to 600,000 barrels a day. Given the high volume of nominations that came in, we've decided to upsize the project to go to 850,000 barrels a day or a net increase of 550,000 barrels over the current capacity. That drove an increase in project cost to our current estimate of about $5 billion, up from the $3.8 billion that we had estimated when we were talking about expanding this pipeline to 600,000 barrels per day.
Obviously, we have to get regulatory approval from the NEB. We expect to have this pipeline expansion in service in 2017. We think this is a very important development for our Canadian oil sands producer customers and their customers. We think it serves us as a real mean to get more of the oil sands production at the West Coast of Canada, and from there, either go into Washington State or across the water. So a lot's happening. We think it's a great time to be in the midstream energy business and look forward to a very strong year and look forward to closing the El Paso merger. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

If you turn to your KMP release or stay in the KMP release and this is the first page of numbers, which is our GAAP income statement. At the bottom, you could see the declared distribution, $1.20 to the first quarter of '12. That's consistent with o",1845,"Okay. If you turn to your KMP release or stay in the KMP release and this is the first page of numbers, which is our GAAP income statement. At the bottom, you could see the declared distribution, $1.20 to the first quarter of '12. That's consistent with our budget and about 5% above what we declared in the first quarter of last year. The only other thing I'd point out on this page is the assets which are subject to the FTC staff agreement have been classified as discontinued operation, consistent with GAAP. And so you can see the income from discontinued operation and then also the noncash loss on remeasurement there of $322 million.
On the -- when you go to the next page, I'll just point out that the income from these assets, we have included in our DCF calculation. We do not pull that out of our DCF calculation. As Rich mentioned, we expect to replace these assets with the dropdowns such that KMP, on a coverage basis, or a DCF basis, would be neutral for the year.
Looking at the second page, all the way to the bottom, as Rich mentioned, $1.37 in DCF per unit in the first quarter. That's up $0.16 or 13% versus last year. We are on budget for the quarter and on budget for the full year. To lines above that, DCF before certain items, which is effectively the total cash available to the limited partners, $462 million in the quarter, that's up $80 million or 21% from -- since last -- first of last year. We are on budget for the quarter and on budget for the year.
Given that, as the DCF per unit available and the declared distribution of $1.20, that gives us coverage of $58 million in the quarter. As we said at the time, at the analyst conference when we presented the budget, we expect to have excess coverage in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we would expect to have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter. And so next quarter when we present, we would not expect to have coverage. But again, we will have coverage for the full year.
Looking up at the total segment earnings before DD&A, $1.029 billion in the first quarter of this year, that's up $150 million or 17% versus last year. 
On Products Pipelines, as Rich mentioned, we're down $4 million, primarily as a result of regulatory agreements. For the full year -- I mean, for the quarter, we are slightly ahead of our budget, primarily because of some better volumes on Cochin. And for the full year, we expect to end -- we expect Product Pipelines to end on budget.
Natural Gas is up $56 million for the quarter or 25%. And that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, the higher contractual volumes on FEP and then the treating acquisition and in addition, better results than we expected from that treating acquisition that we referred to as SouthTex. In the quarter, Natural Gas is about 3% below their budget. And for the full year, we expect them to end about 2% below their budget. As Rich mentioned, as drilling has shifted from the dry basin to the richer areas, we have seen some volume impact on our KinderHawk acquisition and that is really what is causing natural gas to be below budget for the year.
On CO2, up $79 million in the quarter or 31%. As Rich mentioned, higher oil price and higher NGL volumes are driving that. They were slightly below planned in the quarter and that was a function of we were a little bit -- we were below budget on SACROC volumes that would somewhat offset by the help that we got on price. But the help on price is not as much as you would expect. We've outlined our metrics, which is about $6 million in DCF or $1 change in the price of oil. The reason it's not as much as you would expect is because NGL prices got hit. For the full year, we expect that CO2 will be on its budget. We expect that the SACROC volumes will recover and that they will only end a couple of hundred barrels below their budget.
Terminals is up $17 million for the quarter or about 10%. They are on budget for the quarter, and we expect that they will meet or exceed their budget for the full year. 
KMC is up $2 million in the quarter. They are on budget for the quarter, and we expect that they will come in slightly below their budget for the full year on an earnings before DD&A basis. But if you look at that on a DCF basis, we would expect that they would meet their budget for the year.
If you drop down to the general and administrative line, which is about in the middle of your page, $108 million for the quarter. That's $8 million higher than last year. It's a few million dollars higher than our budget, but we actually -- for the quarter, but we actually expect for the full year that we will do a little bit better than our budget, meaning a lower G&A expenses in our budget. 
The next line, interest expense, is up $7 million in the quarter. It's actually slightly favorable in the quarter to our budget, primarily because our balance at the end of last year came in a little bit lower than what we budgeted for the full year. We expect to be positive on interest expense and that's more a function of lower rates.
The last thing I'll mention on this page is sustaining CapEx. Sustaining CapEx in the quarter was $44 million, up $8 million versus last year. It is actually a positive versus our budget, and we expect that it'll be a positive 3% or 4% for the full year.
Turning to the balance sheet. Just from a high level, if you look at the balance sheet, you can see there's a decrease in total assets. And basically, what's happening on the asset side of the ledger is that you're seeing that right off come through there. In addition, we are moving the discontinued operations, again, the assets that are subject to the FTC agreement to assets held for sale. So you see movements out of PP&E investments and goodwill into other current assets. And then the other thing, as you see every quarter happening on the asset side of the balance sheet, is just the investments that we are making and the spending in CapEx.
On the liability side of the balance sheet, the big movements are really in the debt, which I'll reconcile in a minute and on the value of interest rate swaps, which just moves with the forward curve for interest. We ended the quarter at $12.556 billion of debt. That's up $168 million from the end of the year. And just to reconcile that $168 million, we spent over -- a little bit over $300 million on expansion CapEx; about $30 million on acquisitions, that was our CO2 St. John's acquisition; about $49 million was contributed to equity investments; and then we issued about $239 million in equity, about $125 million through the KMP at the market and then the KMR dividend was about $114 million. We had coverage of about $58 million, as I mentioned earlier, and then we have working capital items that were about a negative $77 million. And the 2 big pieces on the working capital were interest with the use of working capital because of most -- our most significant interest payments are in the first quarter and in the third quarter. And then also, we purchased some inventory in our Transmix business as we took over a contract from Shell. Those 2 items were offset by positive sources of working capital on margin and taxes and then AP and AR. So where that leads us in terms of debt to EBITDA for the quarter is at 3.5x, which is an improvement over 12/31 that was at 3.6x. With that, I'll move to KMI.
The first page of the numbers in KMI is the cash available to pay dividends. Rich mentioned we generated $303 million in cash available to pay dividends in the quarter, that is on our budget, and $36 million or 14% above last year. And as you look up at the top, that's driven primarily by the GP interest in KMP, which is up $41 million or 14% from last year. Based on declared dividends of $0.32, we have coverage for the quarter of $76 million similar to KMP. On KMI, we expect that we have coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and for the full year, and that we would have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter. And at KMI, that's primarily a function of the timing on interest and tax payments.
For the full year, we expect to be slightly ahead of our budget of $985 million in cash available to pay dividends. And that $985 million, as we said at budget time, does not include any impact from the acquisition of El Paso.
The income statement, which is our next page at KMI. Similar to KMP, you can see the discontinued operations in the middle of the page. Again, the assets subject to the FTC agreement have been classified as discontinued ops. The loss number is different here because KMI has a different basis in -- or record KMP's assets at a different level than where KMP records on. That was a function of the purchase accounting that was done at the time of the 2007 NPL, just so that people can understand what's going on. 
The -- at KMI, on the balance sheet, again, you see the same thing happening on the asset side of the balance sheet that I just went through with respect to KMP. If you look down at KMI's debt, we ended at $3.21 billion of debt, and that's down $26 million towards the end of the year. That change in debt, $26 million, let me reconcile that for you quickly. Our cash available for dividends that I just went over was $303 million. That is based on the dividends declared by KMP. So what was received from KMP during the quarter was about $19 million lower than that. So you take off that $19 million. KMR, we did not choose to sell the KMR shares at this time, so that's a negative $17 million coming out of that $303 million. We made a pension contribution of $20 million, and we paid dividends of $220 million. And that should get you to the $26 million change in the debt. The debt to cash available, we ended at 2.2x, and that obviously, that's an improvement from the end of last year when we ended at 2.3x. That's it."

Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the first quarter analyst call. We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., or KMI; and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, or KMP. We'll be talking about first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year and",2988,"Okay. Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the first quarter analyst call. We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., or KMI; and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, or KMP. We'll be talking about first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give an overview. Kim Dang, our CFO, will give the detailed financial results and then Park, Steve and I and others at the management team will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.
Let me start with KMI. And it's a very simple story. It begins and ends with cash flow, and we get 99% of our cash from our GP and LP interest in KMP. We pay our taxes on that. We pay the interest on a relatively low amount of debt that we have, and we distribute the balance to the KMI shareholders in the form of dividends. The metric that we think is the most important here is cash available to pay dividends, and for the first quarter of 2012, that number was $303 million. That's up 14% from the $267 million in quarter 1 of 2011 and slightly ahead of our budget. We have increased the quarterly dividend of $0.32 a share, or $1.28 annualized, by way of comparison. That's an increase of 10% from the $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011. As we said previously, we expect to declare dividends of at least $1.35 per share for full year 2012, and that's without the impact of the El Paso merger, which should increase our cash available for dividends on a post-closing basis. 
Now let me give you an update on the El Paso acquisition because I know that's a subject that everybody's interested in, and I'll make several points.
First, as we've said all along, we expect the acquisition to be nicely accretive to KMI. As a result of that and the normal growth rate that we have, KMI expects its dividends per share to grow at an average annual rate of 12.5% through 2015 from its budgeted 2011 dividend per share of $1.16. 
Secondly, one of the things we set out to do early on was to make sure that we are marching along on the integration efforts to put these 2 great companies together. That's proceeded very much on schedule. Enormous effort by lots of people on both the Kinder Morgan and the El Paso side. We are now far enough along, but we're very confident that we will meet or exceed the $350 million per year target in cost savings and other synergies that we pegged at the beginning of the process.
Third point is, as you all know, shareholders of both companies have overwhelmingly approved the merger. 
Fourth point is that we, as promised, at the beginning of the process, have entered into a definitive agreement to sell El Paso's E&P business for approximately $7.15 billion to a group led by Apollo Global Management. We expect to close that transaction at about the same time as the merger closes. And importantly, we expect El Paso's NOL carryforwards to largely offset any taxes from the sale, and therefore, we'll be able to use virtually the entire proceeds to reduce the debt, which KMI incurred for the cash portion of the merger consideration.
Next point is that we have, as you know, reached agreement with the FTC staff to divest certain KMP assets as a necessary step to receive regulatory approval of the transaction. Subject to final approval by the commission, we've agreed to sell Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, our Trailblazer system, certain Wyoming processing and treating facilities and our 50% interest in the REX pipeline. We expect to close that sale in the third quarter of 2012.
The final point I would make is with regard to dropdowns. We intend to offer or drop down El Paso assets to KMP to replace the divested assets. All those divested assets I mentioned belong to KMP, and we expect to offer to KMP all of Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a portion of El Paso Natural Gas. We hope to close that transaction or drop down contemporaneously with the close of the divestiture of the KMP assets, which, again, we believe will occur in the third quarter of this year. We expect the combination of the divestiture and the dropdowns will be neutral to KMP's distribution per unit in 2012, and accretive to KMP's distribution per unit thereafter. 
El Paso also has offered to sell the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate Gas and all of Cheyenne Plains Pipeline to El Paso Pipeline Partners, obviously, subject to final approval of both the El Paso and EPB boards. We expect that dropdown to close contemporaneously with the close of the KMI-El Paso transaction, and we expect it to be immediately accretive to the distribution per unit at El Paso Pipeline Partners. So that's an update on the El Paso situation. 
Now let me turn to KMP. Clearly, all the numbers at KMP that we're talking about now are pre the El Paso merger. At KMP, as we've said so many times, the real important metric there is distributable cash flow per unit. And for the first quarter of this year, it's $1.37 per unit versus $1.21 a year ago or up 13%. And overall, as I'll go through, I think we had a very nice quarter at KMP. 4 of our 5 business segments outperformed the same quarter in 2011, the only exception to that was the Products Pipeline group, which was down slightly, primarily due to lower tariffs as a result of the prior FERC decision and FERC decision 511-A and settlements with customers that we made since the first quarter of last year. We anticipated this, and actually, this segment is mildly positive to plan for the first quarter. 
But turning to that segment, it's pretty apparent to me that refined products volumes are clearly down from 1 year ago, but consistent with the EIA. You'll see from our volume numbers attached to our release for the quarter, overall refined products at Kinder Morgan are down 1.6%. Now that compares to the EIA numbers I recently released of 2.7% negative. But I think you have to adjust our 1.6% to account for the leap year. And if you do that, we're actually at 2.7% also. Now frankly, I don't expect any measurable increase in volumes in the foreseeable future at our -- in our -- in terms of refined products due to a number of industry-wide factors. The growth in this segment is going to come from 4 or 5 other factors that we think are very important, and we have examples of all of these concepts in play right now. The first is we're clearly increasing the amount of biodiesel and ethanol that we're handling, and their tremendous increase off a relatively small base on the biodiesel, I might add, in the first quarter of this year. We also see a lot of opportunities for this segment in the shale plays. Obviously, 2 examples of that are the Kinder Morgan crude and condensate line that will take Eagle Ford volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale play up to the Houston Ship Channel. And once there, another example of what we can do is the fractionator that we now believe will probably start out at around 50,000 barrels per day, and we will build that fractionator to help handle some of the condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford. 
Another opportunity for this segment is selected, targeted expansions for particular customers. Probably the best example of that is the Parkway project, about a $220 million pipeline that will connect a refinery in Southern Louisiana to the mainline Plantation system in Southern Mississippi. That's going along on schedule, and that's a good new project for us. 
And then finally, we have a lot of associated terminals with our Products Pipeline segment, and a lot of those terminals have expansion capabilities and possibilities. Best example of that, probably, is our Carson 7 project in Los Angeles, where we're building 7 new tanks, 2 are already online, the rest will come online at the end of 2012 and early 2013. All of those tanks are under long-term agreements with our customers. So while we don't expect the volumes run through our Products Pipeline in terms of refined products to increase, we do expect to still continue to be able to grow that segment due to these other factors.
Now turning to our Natural Gas segment, I think the story here is that no secret to any of you on this call, there's less activity in the dry gas plays and there's more activity in the richer plays. So for example, as Kim will take you through the numbers, KinderHawk is not seeing the volumes we would have thought we would have seen in our budget year-to-date. On the other hand, it's still above the acquisition plan numbers that we had when we made this acquisition of the second half -- in the middle of 2011. On the other hand, in places like the Eagle Ford, we see activity continuing to ratchet up. For example, in the Eagle Ford, we have a joint venture with BHP. That rig count in drilling activity is increasing rapidly, and we think it will continue to increase throughout 2012 and certainly beyond. Our Treating business has also performed very well, particularly the part of it that manufacturers facilities for sale, known as the SouthTex operation, which we bought last December. Again, we're benefiting largely from activity in shale plays like the Eagle Ford.
And then finally, we think we're, in the Natural Gas segment, building the infrastructure of the future as we've said so many times, particularly with the El Paso merger. We're handling the product that we think is going to be really the base load fossil fuel product for America for the next several decades. As we said so many times, it's clean, it's cheap and it's domestic. We think there will be a lot of additional opportunities that will come in play as a result of having the size of network that we certainly will have after the El Paso acquisition. But one opportunity right now that we see, even pre the El Paso merger, is as we see these opportunities for liquefaction facilities to be built along the Gulf Coast, we have extraordinarily good connectivity to those plays that would be providing the natural gas to be liquefied and to the terminals where the liquification would be done, for example, the Cheniere project outside of Lake Charles. So we will make -- take advantage of our interconnecting pipelines if and when these projects get built.
Turning to our CO2 segment, I think the story there in the first quarter, the pluses were high prices from a WTI standpoint and record NGL production during the quarter. If you look at the oil volumes, we had a combination. SACROC was down to last year, as we expected. Yates was a mild positive to our plan, down a bit from last year. Katz, obviously, very positive to last year and ramping up significantly as we go forward. And if you put all that together, we're down about 900 barrels per day from where we were 1 year ago or about 3%. Overall, the segment's about on plan for the quarter in terms of bottom line performance, and we expect it to be on plan for the year. 
But the really big story for the future, I think, in our CO2 segment is the growth in additional CO2 sales. And I think one of the most significant stories at Kinder Morgan in the first quarter this year was the fact that our CO2 segment signed contracts for 2.1 trillion cubic feet of new CO2 to be supplied to various customers in the Permian Basin. We think these are done at good prices to us and allow us to earn a decent return on the capital we will invest, and they're all long term, with an average life of 16 years. They will peak, if you look at this 2.1 TCF and how it ramps up, it will peak at an additional 450 million cubic feet a day in the peak years of these contracts. And that's significant when you think that right now, we're at about 1.25 billion cubic feet a day. In order to supply these additional CO2 contracts, and we think we will have additional contracts signed in the future, we're going to work at expanding our source fields to accommodate that increased demand. We've already approved and talked about before the roughly $250 million that we're spending in Southwest Colorado. We expect it and that's just at the Doe Canyon facility that we have. We expect to spend someplace in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion, eventually and expanding our production capabilities and our network capacity if the kind of demand we've experienced now continues for the future, and we think it will. 
So all put, we're talking about a great growth opportunity here for CO2 that's a very predictable return over a long period of time, and of course, that will involve, as part of this, the development of our new St. John's field that we just closed on early in the first quarter, which is on the Arizona and New Mexico border. So good future for CO2, particularly in the supply of CO2 to our customers.
On our Terminals side, just had an extraordinary quarter and you just look at it up and down the line and you have to be as we are, very pleased with the performance. We had growth on both the liquids side and the bulk side, just to give you a few numbers. Our throughput on the liquids side was up by 9% compared to the first quarter of '11. Our tonnage on the bulk side was up by 6%. Some of the drivers on the bulk side -- we had a tremendous ramp-up in demand for export coal. So even though we had a downturn in some of our domestic coal handling as you would imagine, given the situation across the country and the warm winter, nevertheless, the total coal volumes were up by 5%, driven largely by record export quantities. Our steel volumes were up 16% in the first quarter of '12 compared to '11.
If you look at the future, we've now authorized and have in progress $1.2 billion worth of capital expenditures in our Terminals group. Those are projects that are in progress. They've been approved by our board. That number that we also shared with you, those of you who were present at our Analyst Day back in January. At that time, it was $860 million. So we've increased by $350 million or so just in the last 3 months since we had our analyst conference. What's driving a lot of this is the coal export business. And when we finish the projects that we've authorized now, we will have increased our capacity to handle export coal to about 45 million tons per year. Now when you think that the whole export coal market is someplace between -- there's a lot of differences on this, but most people think it will settle in someplace between 110 million and 150 million tons a year, but we're handling -- will be handling a very significant part of that.
Then on the liquids side, the main projects there are the big BOSTCO terminal on the ship channel and our large Edmonton South terminal at the beginning of Trans Mountain in Edmonton, Alberta. So great potential for growth in the Terminals segment for years to come. 
Turning to Canada, they have solid performance in the first quarter. We're seeing really good demand from both Washington State and across the dock in Vancouver. We were hampered slightly in the first quarter by pressure restriction on Trans Mountain and that was lifted on March 16, so that will not be an issue the rest of the year. But the big news in terms of our Canadian operations is the Trans Mountain expansion. There, we received -- and we released all this earlier, we received binding bids for 660,000 barrels per day for 20-year contracts. So we had originally, as you may recall, thought that we have the potential to upsize Trans Mountain, which currently has a capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day. Our original thought was we could go from 300,000 to 600,000 barrels a day. Given the high volume of nominations that came in, we've decided to upsize the project to go to 850,000 barrels a day or a net increase of 550,000 barrels over the current capacity. That drove an increase in project costs to our current estimate of about $5 billion, up from the $3.8 billion that we had estimated when we were talking about expanding this pipeline to 600,000 barrels per day.
Obviously, we have to get regulatory approval from the NEB. We expect to have this pipeline expansion in service in 2017. We think this is a very important development for our Canadian oil sands producer customers and their customers. We think it serves us as a real mean to get more of the oil sands production at the West Coast of Canada, and from there, either go into Washington State or across the water. So a lot's happening. We think it's a great time to be in the midstream energy business and look forward to a very strong year and look forward to closing the El Paso merger. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,192876887,285316,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2012",2012-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. If you turn to your KMP release or stay in the KMP release and this is the first page of numbers, which is our GAAP income statement. At the bottom, you could see the declared distribution, $1.20 to the first quarter of '12. That's consistent with o",1844,"Okay. If you turn to your KMP release or stay in the KMP release and this is the first page of numbers, which is our GAAP income statement. At the bottom, you could see the declared distribution, $1.20 to the first quarter of '12. That's consistent with our budget and about 5% above what we declared in the first quarter of last year. The only other thing I'd point out on this page is the assets which are subject to the FTC staff agreement have been classified as discontinued operation, consistent with GAAP. And so you can see the income from discontinued operation and then also the noncash loss on remeasurement there of $322 million.
On the -- when you go to the next page, I'll just point out that the income from these assets, we have included in our DCF calculation. We do not pull that out of our DCF calculation. As Rich mentioned, we expect to replace these assets with the dropdowns such that KMP, on a coverage basis, or a DCF basis, would be neutral for the year.
Looking at the second page, all the way at the bottom, as Rich mentioned, $1.37 in DCF per unit in the first quarter. That's up $0.16 or 13% versus last year. We are on budget for the quarter and on budget for the full year. To lines above that, DCF before certain items, which is effectively the total cash available to the limited partners, $462 million in the quarter, that's up $80 million or 21% from -- since last -- versus last year. We are on budget for the quarter and on budget for the year.
Given that, as the DCF per unit available and the declared distribution of $1.20, that gives us coverage of $58 million in the quarter. As we said at the time, at the analyst conference when we presented the budget, we expect to have excess coverage in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we would expect to have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter. And so next quarter when we present, we would not expect to have coverage. But again, we will have coverage for the full year.
Looking up at the total segment earnings before DD&A, $1.029 billion in the first quarter of this year, that's up $150 million or 17% versus last year. 
On Products Pipelines, as Rich mentioned, we're down $4 million, primarily as a result of regulatory agreements. For the full year -- I mean, for the quarter, we are slightly ahead of our budget, primarily because of some better volumes on Cochin. And for the full year, we expect to end -- we expect Product Pipelines to end on budget.
Natural Gas is up $56 million for the quarter or 25%. And that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, the higher contractual volumes on FEP and then the treating acquisition and in addition, better results than we expected from that treating acquisition that we referred to as SouthTex. In the quarter, Natural Gas is about 3% below their budget. And for the full year, we expect them to end about 2% below their budget. As Rich mentioned, as drilling has shifted from the dry basin to the richer areas, we have seen some volume impact on our KinderHawk acquisition and that is really what is causing natural gas to be below budget for the year.
On CO2, up $79 million in the quarter or 31%. As Rich mentioned, higher oil price and higher NGL volumes are driving that. They were slightly below planned in the quarter and that was a function of we were a little bit -- we were below budget on SACROC volumes that would somewhat offset by the help that we got on price. But the help on price is not as much as you would expect. We've outlined our metrics, which is about $6 million in DCF or $1 change in the price of oil. The reason it's not as much as you would expect is because NGL prices got hit. For the full year, we expect that CO2 will be on its budget. We expect that the SACROC volumes will recover and that they will only end a couple of hundred barrels below their budget.
Terminals is up $17 million for the quarter or about 10%. They are on budget for the quarter, and we expect that they will meet or exceed their budget for the full year. 
KMC is up $2 million in the quarter. They are on budget for the quarter, and we expect that they will come in slightly below their budget for the full year on an earnings before DD&A basis. But if you look at that on a DCF basis, we would expect that they would meet their budget for the year.
If you drop down to the general and administrative line, which is about in the middle of your page, $108 million for the quarter. That's $8 million higher than last year. It's a few million dollars higher than our budget, but we actually -- for the quarter, but we actually expect for the full year that we will do a little bit better than our budget, meaning a lower G&A expenses in our budget. 
The next line, interest expense, is up $7 million in the quarter. It's actually slightly favorable in the quarter to our budget, primarily because our balance at the end of last year came in a little bit lower than what we budgeted for the full year. We expect to be positive on interest expense and that's more a function of lower rates.
The last thing I'll mention on this page is sustaining CapEx. Sustaining CapEx in the quarter was $44 million, up $8 million versus last year. It is actually a positive versus our budget, and we expect that it'll be a positive 3% or 4% for the full year.
Turning to the balance sheet. Just from a high level, if you look at the balance sheet, you can see there's a decrease in total assets. And basically, what's happening on the asset side of the ledger is that you're seeing that right off come through there. In addition, we are moving the discontinued operations, again, the assets that are subject to the FTC agreement to assets held for sale. So you see movements out of PP&E investments and goodwill into other current assets. And then the other thing, as you see every quarter happening on the asset side of the balance sheet, is just the investments that we are making and the spending in CapEx.
On the liability side of the balance sheet, the big movements are really in the debt, which I'll reconcile in a minute and on the value of interest rate swaps, which just moves with the forward curve for interest. We ended the quarter at $12.556 billion of debt. That's up $168 million from the end of the year. And just to reconcile that $168 million, we spent over -- a little bit over $300 million on expansion CapEx; about $30 million on acquisitions, that was our CO2 St. John's acquisition; about $49 million was contributed to equity investments; and then we issued about $239 million in equity, about $125 million through the KMP at the market and then the KMR dividend was about $114 million. We had coverage of about $58 million, as I mentioned earlier, and then we have working capital items that were about a negative $77 million. And the 2 big pieces on the working capital were interest with the use of working capital because of most -- our most significant interest payments are in the first quarter and in the third quarter. And then also, we purchased some inventory in our Transmix business as we took over a contract from Shell. Those 2 items were offset by positive sources of working capital on margin and taxes and then AP and AR. So where that leads us in terms of debt to EBITDA for the quarter is at 3.5x, which is an improvement over 12/31 that was at 3.6x. With that, I'll move to KMI.
The first page of the numbers in KMI is the cash available to pay dividends. Rich mentioned we generated $303 million in cash available to pay dividends in the quarter, that is on our budget, and $36 million or 14% above last year. And as you look up at the top, that's driven primarily by the GP interest in KMP, which is up $41 million or 14% from last year. Based on declared dividends of $0.32, we have coverage for the quarter of $76 million similar to KMP. On KMI, we expect that we have coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and for the full year, and that we would have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter. And at KMI, that's primarily a function of the timing on interest and tax payments.
For the full year, we expect to be slightly ahead of our budget of $985 million in cash available to pay dividends. And that $985 million, as we said at budget time, does not include any impact from the acquisition of El Paso.
The income statement, which is our next page at KMI. Similar to KMP, you can see the discontinued operations in the middle of the page. Again, the assets subject to the FTC agreement have been classified as discontinued ops. The loss number is different here because KMI has a different basis in -- or record KMP's assets at a different level than where KMP records on. That was a function of the purchase accounting that was done at the time of the 2007 NPL, just so that people can understand what's going on. 
The -- at KMI, on the balance sheet, again, you see the same thing happening on the asset side of the balance sheet that I just went through with respect to KMP. If you look down at KMI's debt, we ended at $3.21 billion of debt, and that's down $26 million towards the end of the year. That change in debt, $26 million, let me reconcile that for you quickly. Our cash available for dividends that I just went over was $303 million. That is based on the dividends declared by KMP. So what was received from KMP during the quarter was about $19 million lower than that. So you take off that $19 million. KMR, we did not choose to sell the KMR shares at this time, so that's a negative $17 million coming out of that $303 million. We made a pension contribution of $20 million, and we paid dividends of $220 million. And that should get you to the $26 million change in the debt. The debt to cash available, we ended at 2.2x, and that obviously, that's an improvement from the end of last year when we ended at 2.3x. That's it."

And as usual, we'll be making statements that may fall within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Now that we have closed the El Paso merger, we'll be talking about 3 entities, KMI, Kinder Morgan, Inc.; KMP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners; and EPB, Enron -- I mean El Paso Pipeline Partners. In addition, of course, there's for security KMR, which is the equivalent of KMP, but dividends in FICC and is suitable for investors who do not want to hold an MLP.
Kim will take you through the financial details and there's a good bit of noise there resulting from the El Paso merger, and from the FTC mandated sale. But I think there's a strong fundamental story in most respects. For those of you new to this call into the Kinder Morgan philosophy, we're all about generating cash and paying out that cash to shareholders in distributions or dividends. So the real news here I think is that all 3 entities increased their dividends or distributions for the second quarter. KMI increased its dividend to $0.35, that's up 17% since the second quarter of 2011. And we anticipate dividend at $1.40 for the year 2012. KMP and KMR raised their distribution to $1.23 per quarter, that's up 7% from the second quarter of 2011. And we anticipate distributing $4.98 for the year at KMP and KMR.
EPB increased its dividend to $0.55, that's up 15% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate paying dividends of $2.25 for calendar year 2012.
Now let me talk about each of the 3 entities briefly, before I turn it over to Kim Matt. At KMI, the cash available for dividends this quarter was $307 million, that's up 83% from the $168 million in the second quarter of 2011. If you look at it on the basis of cash available for dividends per share, $0.36 this quarter versus $0.24 in the second quarter of 2011. And I might add that for the full year of 2012 at KMI, we expect to generate over $1.3 billion in cash available for dividends.
Obviously, the most important thing that occurred during the second quarter this year was the completion of the El Paso acquisition on May 24. As we promised, in conjunction with that acquisition, we sold off the E&P assets of El Paso for approximately $7.2 billion. We had originally targeted producing $350 million of cost savings per year. We now expect that number to be North of $400 million per year. We said we would drop down significant assets to EPB, and we did that just prior to the close, by dropping down the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate and all of the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline. We expect to drop down 100% of Tennessee, TGP, and 50% of El Paso Natural Gas to KMP during this third quarter. And I might add that we really believe that TGP obviously, has just a unique footprint in the Marcellus and Utica.
We expect to complete the FTC mandated sales of certain KMP Rockies pipelines during the third quarter also. It's early in the game. We've only had these assets for a little less than 2 months. But so far, the assimilation is going well. We're seeing real upside possibilities from the assets, and we think we've inherited most importantly, a great number of really good people. There are some profound effects that this merger has and just to give you a couple of them, it now makes gas pipelines and storage across all 3 of the entities about 60% of all the earnings before DD&A. So we've become much more of a gas pipeline company obviously.
And then secondly, by putting all these companies together, if you look at enterprise value on a combined basis, at yesterday's close, the total enterprise value of these 3 entities is right at $100 billion. So this is quite a company we've assembled with a footprint that I think is going to pay enormous dividends for years to come.
Now let me turn to KMP. There we -- the distributable cash flow increased by 13% to $366 million. Of course, the key thing for us is distributable cash flow per unit. And that is up to $1.07 versus $1.01 in Q2 of 2011. All the segments were positive in comparison to the second quarter of 2011, in terms of earnings before DD&A prior to certain items, with the exception of the Products Pipeline segment, which was burdened by lower rates on SFPP as a result of FERC and CPUC decisions and settlements. If you look at how the underlying business has performed, and I think sometimes, we're kind of a microcosm of the economy, I can give you some interesting statistics. On the refined products volumes, we were all 0.09 of 1% in terms of throughput for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period a year ago. And coincidentally, that's exactly equal to the EIA numbers recently published for the second quarter.
In terms of NGL volumes, our performance is much, much better. We were up 27% largely through increased volumes on our Goshen and cipher systems. We increased our biofuels and still handling about 30% of all the ethanol consumed in the United States. If you look at some of our terminal activities, we continue to benefit from strong coal export volumes, offset somewhat by weaker domestic coal volumes. Overall, coal volumes in our Terminals group was up 12%. Our petcoke volumes were also up 12%. Steel was up a much more modest 2%. And I think returning to coal for just a minute, we believe that for the full year 2012, we will handle over 20 million tons of coal for export at our 4 export Terminals, 2 on the Houston Ship Channel, 1 on the Mississippi, south of New Orleans and the other in the Newport News, Virginia area. And that's about 20% of all the coal exported from the United States anticipated for calendar year 2012.
The throughput on our liquids Terminals was also positive, up about 5%.
Now turning to our natural gas segment, natural gas transport volumes were up 6% compared to the quarter a year ago. Natural gas sales volumes, virtually all in Texas, were up 12% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And the big Goshen drivers for that 12% increase were increased our demand and increased exports to Mexico. But as we look across all of our pipelines, the power demand is very high, we're setting records both for the month and year-to-date in terms of gas delivery with the power demand on both Tennessee and on the southern natural gas systems. Now all that sounds pretty rosy, but life is never that way. And let me just say that not all is rosy in terms of volumes of natural gas throughput. Clearly, as you could imagine, the volumes are below budget on our dry gas activities, particularly in the Haynesville play, what we call our KinderHawk facility. But I would say their EBITDA there is still nicely above the EBITDA in our acquisition model when we bought the second half of KinderHawk from Petrohawk back in the middle of 2011. So we're below plan in terms of volumes and EBITDA but above our acquisition model in terms of EBITDA.
We're also seeing some producer delays in getting Eagle Ford production into our pipeline systems. I think largely, this is the inability of producers to get equipment delivered on a timely basis. And just the sheer volume of activity there I think is creating some bottlenecks, the but volumes are certainly there. We have long-term throughput contracts. But in some cases, the ramp-up is going more slowly in terms of getting the volumes to us than we would anticipate it would be.
In our CO2 segment, the production volumes are pretty good. SACROC is on 1,600 barrels a day from quarter 1 of 2012 and about flat to quarter 2 of 2011. Cash volumes are obviously, way up above the second quarter of 2011, as that particular field ramps up. But still slightly below our plan for the second quarter of 2012.
Gross NGL production is at record levels, and this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had record levels. So in short, the operations in the CO2 segment are doing pretty well and we expect the rest of the year to continue strong from a production standpoint. The headwind in this section, which would come as no news to any of you probably on the midstream energy business is the deterioration on NGL prices. And there clearly substantially lower than the numbers we had in the budget, which was based on outlook dating from last November. Now we're not quite as bad as some. We estimate now, we put this in the release that if the present trends were to hold through the year, our NGL price would be down by about 23%. So we're not as bad as some others because we do have ethane in our mix. But overall, there's no question the headwind for our CO2 segment.
On the sales and transportation side, demand for CO2 remains strong and we continue to work to expand our source field, both in Southwest Colorado and to develop our newest source field, the St. John's field, which is on the Arizona and New Mexico border.
In Canada, the Trans Mountain volumes were up slightly from the second quarter of 2011. And we expect to have those volumes holding for the rest of the year. Probably the most important development at KMP and perhaps, throughout the whole Kinder Morgan family of companies is the tremendous project development that we're seeing. We've made a lot of progress on these projects, and we're now estimating that our project backlog is now approaching $10 billion. The bulk of that is at KMP but some is in the assets we still hold at KMI and some is still in the EPB assets. But a huge backlog of products and we -- those are all either approved or we expect to approve them with the board very shortly. And it's money that will be spent, not just in 2012 obviously, but over the next 3 or 4 years. All of these projects are backed by long-term contracts with our shippers, which is obviously, a critical thing for us.
Now in detail, the most important of the projects that have been improved in the earnings release and I won't go through them. But I think they've bode very well for future cash flow. Let me just give you a few numbers to remember. Not counting the drop downs of Tennessee and EPNG, which again we expect to occur this quarter nor the CapEx associated with those drop downs, not counting those, we expect KMP to invest about $2.2 billion in expansions and acquisitions this year, up from our original estimate of about $1.5 billion. And remember, that's just for 2012. If you look at in a little more detail, Terminals alone has approved projects of more than $1.3 billion. And much of that money will be spent in '13 and '14, not just in 2012. In the Products Pipeline, feel the projects that we outlined in the release, namely the Houston Condensate Splitter, the Parkway Pipeline and the Cochin reversal project them of those 3 projects alone total almost $700 million in CapEx, most of which will be spent in '13 and '14. And if you add all of the projects that have been approved for the Products Pipelines group, it fits more like $800 million. Now beyond all of thesd projects that are underway and approved and advancing quickly is of course, the Trans Mountain expansion project in Canada. We now have contracts with 9 shippers for approximately 510,000 barrels per day for 20 years ago that allows us to plan and expansion from the present capacity of 300,000 barrels a day to 750,000 barrels a day. Now there'll be a long regulatory process, although I would add that recent developments have indicated that the Canadian national government is very intent on streamlining that process. But we expect to get this approval, and we expect to spend the $4.1 billion to bring this project to completion.
We think that what we built in the 2015, 2016 timeframe, assuming regulatory approval, and be in service sometime in early 2017. Now all these projects, when you count them all up, are just tremendous building blocks for the future. And I think that's what we need more than any other single factor to continue growth at all 3 of these segments.
Now turning to EPB. There, the DCF is down 14% to $135 million for the second quarter of 2012. Again, the more key figure is the DCF per unit, and its 65% this quarter versus $0.60 a year ago. During the quarter, the most significant single event was the completion of the drop-down that I detailed earlier. But we also completed the third and final phase of southern natural gas system 3, and that expansion was placed in service in June. All 3 of those phases together resulted in additional capacity on the system of about 375 million cubic feet a day, and that's all subscribed to -- by the southern companies for electric generation mode. From a broader perspective on EPB, we're just starting the process of assimilating these assets, but we're really very encouraged by the step out expansion opportunities by opportunities for storage, both in the Southeast and the Rockies, and by potential LNG export opportunities. We think EPB will also benefit this year of these reduce costs, which we've been able to put into effect across the entire Kinder Morgan company. So that's an update on where we stand. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,214245593,326911,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with the numbers on K&G. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking on the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement. We don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful, we're go",3726,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with the numbers on K&G. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking on the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement. We don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful, we're going to close this on our calculation of EPS. But the key thing I want to point out here. One, and we're declaring a distribution today of $1.23, that's up about 7% from the second quarter of last year. The other thing on the GAAP income statement, you will see that there is some incremental loss on the remeasurement of our desktops, that's the CFTC assets and adjust them to fair value. That's $327 million, that's noncash. When we go to the DCF calculation, you will see that we exclude that. However, right above that come you'll see the income from discontinued operation, the $48 million. When we calculate DCF because we still own those assets and cash flows, we include that in our calculation of Bcf. So on the second page, towards the bottom of the page, you can see our DCF before certain items. As Rich mentioned, $366 million in the quarter, up $42 million or 13% for the 6 months $828 million, up $122 million. Now just to back up 1 second, what we're doing calculating DCF because is we're taking GAAP net income before certain items, the primary certain item is the loss on remeasurement that I just mentioned. We're adding back DD&A including our share of DD&A. We're making some other small cash taxes adjustments and some other small adjustments, taking out sustaining CapEx to get us to what our what our DCF is. So that is $366 million in the quarter. That's about $1.07 per unit. That compares to the distribution that we're declaring today of $1.23. So we have never coverage in the quarter, which is as we expect we told you that would be the case both the time we went up with a budget.
For the 6 months, $2.44 of distributable cash flow per unit compared to distribution of $2.43. So slightly positive on coverage for the 6 months. For the full year, on coverage, what we're expecting is to be at 1x covered or maybe slightly under that. I'll go through in a minute as I go through where we are relative to our budget but that's primarily a function of lower NGL prices and then lower result, operating results from our KinderHawk assets.
So looking back out at the segments, $959 million in segment earnings before DD&A, up $107 million in the quarter, up $257 million year-to-date. The product pipeline, as Rich mentioned, down $9 million in the quarter, down $13 million year-to-date on actual basis. That is primarily a function of the lower rate from Pacific. We do have lower performance on our Transmix business, as we had a contract expire there. But that's largely offset by favorable on Cochin as a result of a settlement with our shippers. Same factors are driving the year-to-date. With respect to the budget, we're very close to the budget year-to-date for the year, we expect to end slightly below the budget. Natural Gas segment up $47 million in the quarter. It's up $103 million year-to-date. And that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition. The SouthTex acquisition and the favorable results in our trading business and our Fayetteville Express Pipeline, as volumes ramp during 2011.
With respect to our budget year-to-date on natural gas, we're below our budget, primarily as a result of KinderHawk and then, it's staying progressing more slowly in the Eagle Ford as Rich mentioned.
For the year, our on natural gas, we expect to be above our budget things as a result of a drop downs. And so absent the drop downs, we would expect that we would end below our budget primarily as a function of KinderHawk.
CO2 business is a $52 million in the quarter. It's up $131 million year-to-date. Obviously, oil prices up, our oil volumes in the quarter are up about 800 barrels per day, largely as a result of cash. Our NGL volumes are up in the quarter, about 1,100 barrels a day in, and that's slightly offset by lower NGL prices. The same is true for the quarter except for the oil volume is flat. So the same factors, except for the globally. Year-to-date, we are below budget on CO2. And that's a function of oil production -- and as said is about 850 barrels per day below our budget. However, for the full year, given SACROC, the improved performance of SACROC at the end, we're expecting to the end pretty close to our production budget. And so for the full year, we're expecting CO2 to comment about 5% below the budget and that is primarily a factor of lower NGL prices.
Terminal, up $17 million in the quarter, up $34 million year-to-date. 80% of that is internal growth in the quarter, primarily higher volumes in our liquids terminal higher rates and expansion on our liquids terminal, higher coal, export coal volumes and higher volume. At the same factors are largely true on the year-to-date basis. Year-to-date, Terminals is on budget and for the year, we expect them to exceed their budget, primarily due to higher export coal volumes.
Kinder Morgan Canada is flat in the quarter. It's up about $2 million year-to-date. They're slightly exceeding their budget year-to-date, and we expect for the year that they will slightly exceed their budget.
Dropping down to G&A, which is up in the middle of your page, G&A is down $2 million versus -- I'm sorry, up $2 million versus last year. It's up $10 million versus last year-to-date. It's on budget year-to-date. And for the year, we expect it to be above its budget. And we expect it for it to be above its budget largely as a result of the drop downs of GDP and EPNG. Absent the drop-down, we would come in under our budget on G&A, primarily as a function of higher capitalized overhead as capital expenditures have increased to that 2.2 Rich mentioned before.
Interest expense, up $12 million versus the second quarter last year, up $19 million year-to-date. That's primarily a function of the higher balance. Our balance is up about $1.3 billion. Year-to-date, we are favorable to budget as a result of lower rate. For the full year, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the acquisitions. If you strip out the acquisition, we would expect that interest expense would be favorable versus our budget also as a function of lower rate.
Sustaining CapEx in the quarter is up $3 million. So higher spending in the quarter than a year ago. It's also up year-to-date. Versus our budget year-to-date, we're actually favorable. We spent less than we anticipated. Some of that is timing. But for the full year, we expect sustaining capital to be above our budget. And that's also a function of the acquisition. Our full-year forecast does build in the impact of the drop-down and from KMI, as well as the FTC divestitures. We think we'll be in the range of $55 million higher than our budget. If you strip out the acquisition, we would come in favorable to budget, primarily some has moved -- some of the sustaining CapEx have moved to O&M and then there was a small amount of savings and deferrals.
So that is the DCF for the quarter. I'll move to the balance sheet. The balance sheet -- I'm just been a focus on the debt, $12.6 billion is our net debt in the quarter. That resulted in debt to EBITDAR of 3.4x. That's down from year-end of 3.6x and down from last quarter at 3.5x. We expect to end the year at about 3.9x debt to EBITDAX that's a bit of but that all the although that associated with the drop down transaction and only a partial year of the operating results. So if you pro forma the EBITDA for a full year, so you take out the FTC asset and you put in a full-year TGP end of the and EPNG, wind the year at 3.7x. The change in debt for the quarter is about $55 million. For the year-to-date, it's about $223 million. And just to go through the main drivers of that, on a quarter, we had about $730 million of spending. It was $400 million of expansion CapEx, about $300 million of acquisition and about $35 million of -- equity investments. We issued equity of $578 million. That's KMR, that's KMP at the market issued about $300 million in the midstream transaction. We have a rate case settlement payment of $54 million. We unwound -- largely offset that. The positive 63. Our coverage was negative $56 million and then we had working capital positive of $157 million. And that is primarily accreted to interest.
Year-to-date, $223 million change in debt. We spent a little over $1.1 billion year-to-date. That's about $700 million in expansion, $330 million in acquisition, with the acquisition being the $300 million midstream acquisition and about $86 million in contributions to equity investment, primarily Eagle Ford and EagleHawk. We raised about $817 million of equity, to got that rate is again -- largely offset. Coverage is about $3 million positive. And then we had $82 million of positive working capital, which was primarily tax premiums, accrued taxes, AP and AR inventory in our Transmix business. That's KMP.
Moving to EPB and the first page of EPB is also the GAAP income statement. As Rich said, we're declaring distribution of $0.55 in the quarter. The GAAP income statement recaps our prior period results to include Cheyenne Plains as EPB had owned Cheyenne Plains during all periods presented. So when I go to the next page and be start our calculation of Bcf, you will not -- it will only include Cheyenne Plains for the periods that we owned. So you can see the incremental impact from the acquisition. Bcf calculation -- this is -- for some of you to follow EPB, it's going to be a little bit of a new format. The new format is consistent with KMP's format. I think we the same answer at the end of the day. It's just done, it's laid out a little bit differently. So KMP, were just taking that income, adding back DD&A and subtracting sustaining CapEx. There are a couple of other adjustments to get to DCF that you'll see at the bottom that are consistent with the adjustments that El Paso was making previously.
So DCF before certain items as Rich mentioned, $135 million in the quarter, up $17 million in the quarter, up $22 million year-to-date. $135 million and $0.65 on a per unit basis that's versus our $0.55 declared distribution, resulting coverage of about $20 million. On the 6 months, the 2 78 is $1.35% compared to our declared distribution of $1.06. That's about $60 million. And as Rich mentioned, for the year, we expect the clearing of $2.25 and to have coverage in excess of $80 million. Now just looking at the $17 million, where did that growth come from? If you look out that the segment, the segment was up $17 million. And primarily the acquisition of Cheyenne Plains as well as improved results on southern natural as a result of the completed expansion project and greater power demand load.
About $17 million though because El Paso consolidated all the pipeline in prior periods and we did owned 100% of those pipelines. And so you're seeing the benefit of the acquisition down below in the minority interest line. So EPB has bought more of those assets from El Paso. The minority interest decreases. And so you see that benefit down in the minority interest line below. So if you add that, that takes your $17 million, it's about $4 million benefit from those incremental acquisitions since 2011. So that's $21 million total increase in the assets. Sustaining CapEx is a positive $17 million in the quarter. That's because there were -- in 2011, there was some nonrecurring maintenance item. There's some timing, which I will get to in a second, and also the cost savings that we implemented. So yes, $38 million of cash flow available interest is up by $10 million as a result of the acquisition. GP incentive is up $13 million as a result of these units issued and the increase in the distribution. There are some other items that are about $2 million and that takes you to the $17 million.
Same analysis for the year-to-date. The segments are up $7 million. The incremental acquisitions is it showed up in the minority interest line, it's $30 million. That's $37 million total. Sustaining CapEx is $29 million lower. Now on sustaining CapEx, for the full year, we're expecting is around $55 million to $60 million. So you can see in the quarter and year-to-date, there is some timing relative to the full-year. But we do expect -- but we are lower than last year in the quarter.
Interest is up $20 million, GP incentive is up $25 million year-to-date. There is about $1 million of other items and so that takes you to the increased sales of $22 million for the year-to-date. On EPB's balance sheet, the largest change in EPB's balance sheet relates to the drop-down of CIG, the 14% interest in CIG and the Cheyenne Plains. And so you can see that the debt is up about $509 million. And then you also see equity is negative. And those results because we have to recap. And so when we recash these -- we own these assets in all periods, you originally do it, you don't have the financing because they're assuming the math you put assets on your books saying that, that creates a positive in equity. And then when you go financing that, that already beyond your books for GAAP purposes, that is going to be a negative running through your equity account. So you can see that happening this quarter.
On the debt-to-EBITDA basis, 4.7x versus 4.1x. Now the debt here on the balance sheet has also been recap for Cheyenne Plains. So the 3990 at the end of the year was not really what balance sheet at the end of the year. What was the balance sheet at the end of the year was 3.825. So we're up about $800 million year-to-date, and we are up about sorry, we're up $800 million for the quarter, we're up about $750 million year-to-date. The acquisitions, $635 million went out the door on that but we also issued equity for $64 million, so $570 million. We assume that $176 million in debt, there's $23 million in expansion capital, $45 million in the termination of an AR program. Cheyenne Plains came with cash of about $20 million. There's about $20 million of coverage, and then there's working capital of about $27 million negative. Largely associated with accrued interest. Year-to-date, the acquisition, 635, 176 of debt assumed, $40 million of expansion CapEx, same $45 million on the termination of a our program, same $20 mil of cash, equity issued, $64 million, coverage is $60 million and then the working capital is about $4 million.
And so that is EPB. That's EBITDA that's EBITDA within KMI, couple of overall comments for those of you who might be new. This is our calculation of cash available to pay dividends at KMI.
So what we are showing here is the cash that we received based on the declared distribution at KMP and EPB. It is the cash that we -- or the cash available to us from our NGPL. And then this quarter we have added a second section because it is now KMI owned assets. And so we divided by the schedule, the top schedule the top half of the schedule is so-called the GP section and the bottom half is what I'll call the asset section. The asset section is assets that we intend to drop over time to KMP and EPB. So it will largely go away over time, and the cash flows will move up into the GP section. Now it's not perfect. There's all the interest associated with the El Paso acquisition is on the bottom part of the section. All the cash taxes are on the top part of the section. But if you try to get, if you ask 5 different people how to allocate this, they do it with 5 different ways. So we didn't try to go through an allocation exercise. That's just presented for simplicity.
In the schedule, we have -- there are no transaction costs in the schedule. What we're trying to show here is the recurring cashflow that is available for distribution. So in the quarter, $307 million available for distribution, that's $0.36 a unit -- I mean, per share versus our declared dividend of $0.35 a share. For the 6 months, $610 million, which is $0.79 per share versus $0.67 on a declared basis. The -- we're up again $139 million in the quarter, $175 million year-to-date. If you look at what's driving the $139 million, the KMP's distribution to us, $393 million, that's up $49 million. The distribution from EPB, $82 million -- up $82 million. And then that's offset somewhat by lower distributions from NGPL, higher interest expense and higher cash taxes those 3 totaling about $20 million. So the -- you get to about $100 million in cash available to pay dividends before you get to the assets that we own. The assets generated about $38 million. Some of you may say things are kind of flow. But remember that all the acquisition interest is allocated to this section. We have already dropped some of the assets to EPB, and the GP and LP contribution from EPB are up above the $80 million.
In the year-to-date, $175 million increase, $767 million is coming from KMP. That's over $90 million increase. EPB is an $82 million increase. So between the 2 of those, you have about $170 million increase. NGPL is down a little bit, but NGPL is, for the full year, is consistent that's consistent with what we budgeted. And so the interest is up a little bit. G&A's up a little bit in cash taxes are up about $20 million to take you to $137 million. Again, we have $38 million from the assets to get you $175 million increase, which is about 40% increase and the cash available year-to-date.
Moving to the GAAP net income, the -- there's a lot of noise given all the transaction expenses in the quarter. But our net income attributable to KMI as $125 million loss. Now in the footnote on the prior page, you can see that's there's about $273 million of after-tax expenses associated with EPC transaction and the EPB transaction. There's also $29 million deferred tax adjustments associated with the transaction. There's $24 million in KMP certain items that flow through to KMI on an income basis, which is largely KMI share of the FTC revaluation. And then there's $15 million of other purchase accounting. If you add those back, which is about $341 million, you get to about $216 million of net income, which is about $0.26 a share. We don't, again, think that the GAAP income statement as overly meaningful. But I know that some of you are required to sort of -- net income.
The next page is the GAAP reconciliation, which I'm not going to go through. I'm just going to spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. And the balance sheet is a consolidated balance sheet. Consolidated EPB into KMI. This is preliminary. We expect that there will be some movement in this balance sheet given the transaction of finalizing purchase accounting. We expect primarily but there could be some other changes as well.
If you look down to the bottom -- first, the change in total assets of about $38.8 billion. Of that, KMP is about $300 million and really, the remaining change is almost all attributable to the acquisition of El Paso. On the debt balance, KMI's debt balance is about $15.4 billion. That debt balance we expect to come down as we drop assets to KMP over -- in this quarter. But some of that debt will move to KMP as KMP takes on debt financing acquisition. So on a consolidated basis and pro forma in the EBITDA for the full year, we expect to end the year slightly over 5x. The change in debt on the quarter is about -- for the year it's about $13.128 billion. For the quarter, it's about $13.155 billion. And so I'm going to reconcile that for you quickly.
The transaction, we assume, about $7.3 billion in net debt from EPC. We also issued about $5.4 billion. And then when KMP purchased the other half of midstream, it costs us to consolidate midstream debt on KMI's balance sheet, so that's another $100 million. So that's above about $12.8 billion. So it is $12.827 billion, and then, so the change in debt is $328 million after you take out the transaction that -- issue. The performance metric that we went through was $307 million. There's about $146 million of timing on distributions, and that we recognize those distributions in the quarter for the performance metric but we haven't received in the cash yet. Now that's higher than we would anticipate going forward, but we anticipate going forward is about $15 million. It's higher in this quarter primarily because this the first quarter that we've gotten a distribution from EPB. We show it on the performance metric, but we don't actually receive that distribution until August. We paid $226 million of dividends in the quarter. We repurchased about $110 million of warrant. There's $125 million of transaction related item, primarily severance and retention bonuses and then the termination of the AR financing facility. And then there is about $28 million of other items expansion, CapEx and contributions to equity investments. To get you to your total change of $328 million. So that's all I have."

So I think there are enormous opportunities there them a someplace between this figures before they very a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Some place between $450 million to $650 million in coal export facilities alone. But we -- we're going to have an expansion of Galena Park, pursue it to a new long-term contract that we will be releasing information on tomorrow, as a matter of fact. We're going to have other expansions, certainly the Edmonton South terminal as we say in our release is actually upscale again because we had more long-term contracts. I think the BOSTCO facility on the ship channel will actual also be probably upsize because we think we're about to move beyond 6.6 million barrels that was our original anticipated amount of tax, we think we'll be able to expand that. So just a lot of opportunities. Again, we look at it based on whether they clear our return capital targets and whether we have good long-term contracts behind."

Those of you who follow it closely, the Prime Minister government has said that they want a full environmental review of these projects but they wanted it done on a timely basis. In fact, one of the trade rights this morning saying that the NEB is taking steps in that regard, and was looking at an 18-month time horizon for saying yes or no on project gnome either how complicated they might be. So I'm always worried when you set sometime but they can clearly, future projects like Trans Mountain from the time you file are not going to be dragged out for 3 or 4 years and have thousands of hours of hearings. I think everyone will have a say at the table. But I think it will be done in a very fair but expedited basis. So we believe it will be done quickly. Now what we have done as many of you know, is we have filed with the NEB for approval of the commercial contracts. In other words, what we're doing is converting a pipeline that now moves 300,000 barrels a day and is essentially an open access pipeline. Now we're expanding it dramatically and we have 500,000 plus barrels that is subscribed under 20-year contracts. Clearly, leaving plenty of room to handle all of the spot basis. You got 206,000 to 240,000 barrels that's 750 minus 5 10 to handle all of the other business. But we want to get that approved to make sure the NEB agrees with our commercial efforts here, our commercial understanding that we reached mining agreements with our customers. In the meantime, we are always going through what's called the consulting project with various interested parties, including NGLs, including the First Nation's Group primarily in British Columbia, and then we will file for the actual permitting of the pipeline itself in late 2013. And that's when the -- when that process will start. Again, if you assume 18 months, it may not be the exact right time. If you assume 18 month, you file late in 2013, that will get your approval in the mid 2015 time horizon. Give us time to build it, 2015 and 2016. So that's kind of the game plan, no rocket science here, but there has been some very positive developments from the standpoint of the Canadian national government saying these are very important assets. It's not just oilsands production, it's some of the mineral production in British Columbia, some of the potash in Saskatchewan, other areas of Canada where they want to make sure that they have an orderly process to consider these. And I think that, that's going to be a positive for our process."

Those that can move up or down with the events we can't control will be subject to a pass-through arrangement, that there'll be a noncontrolled cost. So we think we've got a pretty workable solution there. This is what we did on the last time we expanded Trans Mountain from roughly 220,000 barrels up to 300,000. And it worked very well."

I'm looking forward to the day when Kim will be able to give you a much simpler summary of how we get cash available for dividends at KMI and it will be simply all up to GP and units we'll be back to being a pure GP. Now part of the reason for that is that the sale that was mandated by the FTC is somewhat larger than we thought it would be. And therefore, KMP can't move more quickly as more proceeds coming in than we anticipated. It can move more quickly to take on more assets. But we think we can move as pretty quickly, and we're anxious to get back to a pure GP, where you can evaluate it just on that basis."

There is tremendous demand for increased exports to Mexico, we have publicly surfaced already about 3 of those projects and we think that -- not only does that have the benefit of allowing us to earn money on incremental investments as we build, if you will, drops or laterals down the board or off the EPNG mainline, but also obviously, puts more volume through the EPNG mainline. And I think we -- that will be a big source of opportunity for us. I think also, you will have some east of California coal-fired generation that we'll be converting to natural gas. Natural gas as time goes on. And I believe there maybe some potential for alternative uses. Some of the EPNG lines, there's a lot of duplication there. So we're just getting into it, but we've got a very bright guy running that for us and I think we will find some real opportunities to benefit there."

This is the Kinder Morgan earnings call and, as usual, we'll be making statements that may fall within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Now that we have closed the El Paso merger, we'll be talking about 3 entities: KMI, Kinder Morgan, Inc.; KMP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners; and EPB, Enron -- I mean, El Paso Pipeline Partners. In addition, of course, there's a fourth security KMR, which is the equivalent of KMP, but is -- pays its dividends in FICC and is suitable for investors who do not want to hold an MLP.
Kim will take you through the financial details, and there's a good bit of noise there resulting from the El Paso merger and from the FTC mandated sale. But I think there's a strong fundamental story in most respects. For those of you new to this call, into the Kinder Morgan philosophy, we're all about generating cash and paying out that cash to shareholders in distributions or dividends. So the real news here, I think, is that all 3 entities increased their dividends or distributions for the second quarter.
KMI increased its dividend to $0.35. Now that's up 17% since the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate dividending $1.40 for the year 2012. KMP and KMR raised their distribution to $1.23 per quarter. That's up 7% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate distributing $4.98 for the year at KMP and KMR. EPB increased its dividend to $0.55. That's up 15% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate paying dividends of $2.25 for calendar year 2012.
Now let me talk about each of the 3 entities briefly, before I turn it over to Kim. At KMI, the cash available for dividends this quarter was $307 million. That's up 83% from the $168 million in the second quarter of 2011. If you look at it on the basis of cash available for dividends per share, $0.36 this quarter versus $0.24 in the second quarter of 2011. And I might add that for the full year of 2012 at KMI, we expect to generate over $1.3 billion in cash available for dividends.
Obviously, the most important thing that occurred during the second quarter this year was the completion of the El Paso acquisition on May 24. As we promised, in conjunction with that acquisition, we sold off the E&P assets of El Paso for approximately $7.2 billion. We had originally targeted producing $350 million of cost savings per year. We now expect that number to be north of $400 million per year.
We said we would drop down significant assets to EPB, and we did that just prior to the close by dropping down the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate and all of the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline. We expect to drop down 100% of Tennessee, TGP, and 50% of El Paso Natural Gas to KMP during this third quarter. And I might add that we really believe that TGP, obviously, has just a unique footprint in the Marcellus and Utica. We expect to complete the FTC mandated sales of certain KMP Rockies pipelines during the third quarter also.
It's early in the game. We've only had these assets for a little less than 2 months. But so far, the assimilation is going well. We're seeing real upside possibilities from the assets, and we think we've inherited, most importantly, a great number of really good people. There are some profound effects that this merger has and, just to give you a couple of them, it now makes gas pipelines and storage across all 3 of the entities about 60% of all the earnings before DD&A. So we've become much more of a gas pipeline company, obviously.
And then secondly, by putting all these companies together, if you look at enterprise value on a combined basis, at yesterday's close, the total enterprise value of these 3 entities is right at $100 billion. So this is quite a company we've assembled, with a footprint that I think is going to pay enormous dividends for years to come.
Now let me turn to KMP. There the distributable cash flow increased by 13% to $366 million. Of course, the key thing for us is distributable cash flow per unit, and that is up to $1.07 versus $1.01 in Q2 of 2011. All the segments were positive in comparison to the second quarter of 2011 in terms of earnings before DD&A prior to certain items, with the exception of the Products Pipeline segment, which was burdened by lower rates on SFPP as a result of FERC and CPUC decisions and settlements.
If you look at how the underlying business has performed, and I think sometimes we're kind of a microcosm of the economy, I can give you some interesting statistics. On the refined products volumes, we were all 0.09% in terms of throughput for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period a year ago. And coincidentally, that's exactly equal to the EIA numbers recently published for the second quarter.
In terms of NGL volumes, our performance was much better. We were up 27%, largely through increased volumes on our Cochin and Cypress systems. We increased our biofuels volumes, and we're still handling about 30% of all the ethanol consumed in the United States. If you look at some of our terminal activities, we continue to benefit from strong coal export volumes, offset somewhat by weaker domestic coal volumes. Overall, coal volumes in our Terminals group was up 12%.
Our petcoke volumes were also up 12%. Steel was up a much more modest 2%. And I think, returning to coal for just a minute, we believe that for the full year 2012, we will handle over 20 million tons of coal for export at our for-export terminals, 2 on the Houston Ship Channel, 1 on the Mississippi, south of New Orleans; and the other in the Newport News, Virginia area. And that's about 20% of all the coal exported from the United States anticipated for calendar year 2012. The throughput on our liquids terminals was also positive, up about 5%.
Turning to our Natural Gas segment, natural gas transport volumes were up 6% compared to the quarter a year ago. Natural gas sales volumes, virtually all in Texas, were up 12% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And the big drivers for that 12% increase were increased power demand and increased exports to Mexico. But as we look across all of our pipelines, the power demand is very high. We're setting records both for the month and year-to-date in terms of gas delivery to the power demand on both Tennessee and on the southern natural gas systems.
Now all that sounds pretty rosy, but life is never that way. And let me just say that not all is rosy in terms of volumes of natural gas throughput. Clearly, as you can imagine, the volumes are below budget on our dry gas activities, particularly in the Haynesville play, what we call our KinderHawk facility. But I will say that our EBITDA there is still nicely above the EBITDA in our acquisition model when we bought the second half of KinderHawk from Petrohawk back in the middle of 2011. So we're below plan in terms of volumes and EBITDA but above our acquisition model in terms of EBITDA.
We're also seeing some producer delays in getting Eagle Ford production into our pipeline systems. I think largely this is the inability of producers to get equipment delivered on a timely basis, and just the sheer volume of activity there, I think, is creating some bottlenecks. But volumes are certainly there. We have long-term throughput contracts. But in some cases, the ramp up is going more slowly in terms of getting the volumes to us than we would have anticipate it would be.
In our CO2 segment, the production volumes are pretty good. SACROC is up 1,600 barrels a day from quarter 1 of 2012 and about flat to quarter 2 of 2011. Cash volumes are obviously way up above the second quarter of 2011 as that particular field ramps up, but still slightly below our plan for the second quarter of 2012.
Gross NGL production is at record levels, and this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had record levels. So in short, the operations in the CO segment are doing pretty well, and we expect the rest of the year to continue strong from a production standpoint. The headwind in this section, which would come as no news to any of you who follow the midstream energy business, is the deterioration in NGL prices, and they're clearly substantially lower than the numbers we had in the budget, which was based on outlook dating from last November. Now we're not quite as bad as some. We estimate now, we put this in the release, that if the present trends were to hold through the year, our NGL price would be down by about 23%. So we're not as bad as some others because we do have less ethane in our mix. But overall, there's no question that that's a headwind for our CO2 segment.
On the sales and transportation side, demand for CO2 remains strong, and we continue to work to expand our source fields, both in Southwest Colorado and to develop our newest source field, the St. John's field, which is on the Arizona and New Mexico border.
In Canada, the Trans Mountain volumes were up slightly from the second quarter of 2011, and we expect to have those volumes hold in for the rest of the year. Probably the most important development at KMP and perhaps throughout the whole Kinder Morgan family of companies is the tremendous project development that we're seeing. We've made a lot of progress on these projects, and we're now estimating that our project backlog is now approaching $10 billion. The bulk of that is at KMP, but some is in the assets we still hold at KMI and some is in the EPB assets. But a huge backlog of products, and we -- those are already either approved, or we expect to approve them with the board very shortly. And it's money that will be spent not just in 2012, obviously, but over the next 3 or 4 years. All of these projects are backed by long-term contracts with our shippers, which is obviously a critical thing for us.
Now we've detailed the most important of the projects that have been improved in the earnings release, and I won't go through them, but I think they bode very well for future cash flow. Let me just give you a few numbers to remember. Not counting the drop-downs of Tennessee and EPNG, which again we expect to occur this quarter, nor the CapEx associated with those drop-downs, not counting those, we expect KMP to invest about $2.2 billion in expansions and acquisitions this year, up from our original estimate of about $1.5 billion. And remember, that's just for 2012.
If you look at a little more -- in a little detail, Terminals alone has approved projects of more than $1.3 billion, and much of that money will be spent in '13 and '14, not just in 2012. In the Products Pipelines, 3 of the projects that we outlined in the release, namely the Houston condensate splitter, the Parkway Pipeline and the Cochin Reversal project, those 3 projects alone total almost $700 million in CapEx, most of which will be spent in '13 and '14.  And if you add all of the projects that have been approved for the Products Pipelines group, it's more like $800 million.
Now beyond all these projects that are underway and approved and advancing quickly is, of course, the Trans Mountain Expansion project in Canada. We now have contracts with 9 shippers for approximately 510,000 barrels per day for 20 years. That allows us to plan an expansion from the present capacity of 300,000 barrels a day to 750,000 barrels a day. Now there'll be a long regulatory process, although I would add that recent developments have indicated that the Canadian national government is very intent on streamlining that process. But we expect to get this approval, and we expect to spend the $4.1 billion to bring this project to completion.
We think it will be built in the 2015, 2016 time frame, assuming regulatory approval, and be in service sometime in early 2017. Now all these projects, when you count them all up, are just tremendous building blocks for the future, and I think that's what we'll need more than any other single factor to continue growth at all 3 of these entities.
Now turning to EPB, there, the DCF is up 14% to $135 million for the second quarter of 2012. Again, the more key figure is the DCF per unit and is 65% this quarter versus $0.60 a year ago. During the quarter, the most significant single event was the completion of the drop-down that I detailed earlier. But we also completed the third and final phase of a southern natural gas system 3, and that expansion was placed in service in June. All 3 of those phases together resulted in additional capacity on the system of about 375 million cubic feet a day, and that's all subscribed to -- by the southern companies for electric generation mode.
From a broader perspective on EPB, we're just starting the process of assimilating these assets, but we're really very encouraged by the step out expansion opportunities; by opportunities for storage, both in the Southeast and the Rockies; and by potential LNG export opportunities. We think EPB will also benefit from this [ph] next year, these reduce costs, which we've been able to put into effect across the entire Kinder Morgan companies. So that's an update on where we stand. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

Okay, I'm going to start with the numbers on KMP. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking at the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement, we don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful. We",3817,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. Okay, I'm going to start with the numbers on KMP. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking at the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement, we don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful. We're going to focus on our calculation of EPS. But a few things I want to point out here, one, we're declaring a distribution today of $1.23. That's up about 7% from the second quarter of last year. The other thing on the GAAP income statement, you will see that there is an incremental loss on the remeasurement of our discounts. That's the FTC assets. To adjust them to fair value, that's $327 million. That's noncash. When we go to the DCF calculation, you'll see that we exclude that. However, right above that, you'll see the income from discontinued operations, the $48 million. When we calculate DCF because we still own those assets and we get those cash flows, we include that in our calculation of DCF.
So on the second page, towards the bottom of the page, you can see our DCF before certain items. As Rich mentioned, $366 million in the quarter, up $42 million or 13%. For the 6 months, $828 million, up $122 million. Now just to back out one second, what we're doing in calculating DCF is we're taking GAAP net income before certain items, the primarily -- the primary certain item is the loss on remeasurement that I just mentioned. We're adding back DD&A, including our share of DD&A. We're making some other small adjustments, book cash taxes and some other small adjustments, taking out sustaining CapEx to get us to what our DCF is. So that is $366 million in the quarter. That's about $1.07 per unit. That compares to the distribution that we're declaring today of $1.23. So we have negative coverage in the quarter, which is -- we expected. We told you that, that would be the case, both last quarter, at the time we went over the budget.
For the 6 months, $2.44 of distributable cash flow per unit compared to a distribution of $2.43. So slightly positive on coverage for the 6 months. For the full year, on coverage, what we're expecting is to be at 1x coverage or maybe slightly under that. And I'll go through in a minute as I go through where we are relative to our budget, but that's primarily a function of lower NGL prices and then lower result, operating results from our KinderHawk assets.
So looking back out at the segments, $959 million in segment earnings before DD&A, up $107 million in the quarter, up $257 million year-to-date. The Products Pipelines, as Rich mentioned, down $9 million in the quarter, down $13 million year-to-date on an actual basis. That is primarily a function of the lower rate from Pacific. We do have lower performance on our Transmix business as we had a contract expire there, but that's largely offset by a favorable on Cochin as a result of a settlement with our shippers.
The same factors are driving the year-to-date. With respect to the budget, we're very close to the budget year-to-date. For the year, we expect to end slightly below the budget. Natural Gas segment is up $47 million in the quarter. It's up $103 million year-to-date, and that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, the SouthTex acquisition and just favorable results in our trading business and our Fayetteville Express Pipeline, as volumes ramp during 2011.
With respect to our budget year-to-date on Natural Gas, we're below our budget, primarily as a result of KinderHawk. And then it's staying -- progressing more slowly in the Eagle Ford as Rich mentioned. For the year, on Natural Gas, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the drop-downs. And so absent the drop-downs, we would expect that we would end below our budget, primarily as a function of KinderHawk.
CO2 business is up $52 million in the quarter. It's up $131 million year-to-date. Obviously, oil price is up. Our oil volumes in the quarter are up about 800 barrels per day, largely as a result of caps. Our NGL volumes are up in the quarter, about 1,100 barrels a day, and then that's slightly offset by lower NGL prices. The same is true for the quarter except where the oil volume is flat. So the same factors, except the oil volume.
Year-to-date, we are below budget on CO2, and that's on a function. Oil production is, as I said, about 850 barrels per day below our budget. However, for the full year, given SACROC, the improved performance of SACROC, we're expecting to end pretty close to our production budget. And so for the full year, we're expecting CO2 to come in about 5% below its budget, and that is primarily a factor of lower NGL prices.
Terminal is up $17 million in the quarter, up $34 million year-to-date. 80% of that is internal growth in the quarter, primarily higher volumes on our liquids terminals, higher rates and expansions on our liquids terminals, higher coal, export coal volumes and higher petcoke volumes. And the same factors are largely true on the year-to-date basis. Year-to-date, Terminals is on budget. And for the year, we expect them to exceed their budget, primarily due to higher export coal volumes.
Kinder Morgan Canada is flat in the quarter. It's up about $2 million year-to-date. They're slightly exceeding their budget year-to-date, and we expect for the year that they will slightly exceed their budget.
Dropping down to G&A, which is about in the middle of your page, G&A is down $2 million versus -- I'm sorry, is up $2 million versus last year. It's up $10 million versus last year, year-to-date. It's on budget year-to-date. And for the year, we expect it to be above its budget. And we expect to be its -- for it to be above its budget, largely as a result of the drop-downs of GDP and EPNG. Absent the drop-downs, we would come in under our budget on G&A, primarily as a function of higher capitalized overhead as capital expenditures have increased to the $2.2 billion that Rich mentioned before.
Interest expense, up $12 million versus the second quarter last year, up $19 million year-to-date. That's primarily a function of the higher balance. Our balance is up about $1.3 billion. Year-to-date, we are favorable to budget as a result of lower rates. For the full year, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the acquisitions. If you strip out the acquisitions, we would expect that interest expense would be favorable versus our budget, also as a function of lower rates.
Sustaining CapEx in the quarter is up $3 million. So higher spending in the quarter than a year ago. It's also up year-to-date. Versus our budget year-to-date, we're actually favorable. We've spent less than we anticipated. Some of that is timing. But for the full year, we expect sustaining capital to be above our budget, and that's also a function of the acquisitions. Our full year forecast does build in the impact of the drop-downs and from KMI, as well as the FTC divestitures. We think we'll be in the range of $55 million higher than our budget. If you strip out the acquisitions, we would come in favorable to budget. Primarily, some has moved -- some of the sustaining CapEx has moved to O&M and then there is a small amount of savings and deferrals.
So that is the DCF for the quarter. I'll move to the balance sheet. The balance sheet -- I'm just going to focus on the debt. $12.6 billion is our net debt in the quarter. That results in a debt to EBITDA of 3.4x. That's down from year end of 3.6x and down from last quarter at 3.5x. We expect to end the year at about 3.9x debt to EBITDA, but that also has all the debt associated with the drop-down transactions and only a partial year of the operating results. So if you pro forma the EBITDA for a full year, so you take out the FTC assets and you put in a full year of TGP and EPNG, we went in the year at 3.7x.
The change in debt for the quarter is about $55 million. For the year-to-date, it's about $223 million. And just to go through the main drivers of that, on the quarter, we had about $730 million of spending. It was $400 million of expansion CapEx, about $300 million of acquisitions and about $35 million of contributions to equity investments.
We issued equity of $578 million. That's KMR. That's KMP at the market. We issued about $300 million in the Midstream transaction. We had a rate case settlement payment of $54 million. We unwound a swap that largely offset that. It was a positive $53 million. Our coverage was negative $56 million and then we had a working capital positive of $157 million. And that is primarily accrued interest.
Year-to-date, a $223 million change in debt. We've spent a little over $1.1 billion year-to-date. That's about $700 million in expansion, $330 million in acquisitions, the biggest acquisition being the $300 million Midstream acquisition and about $86 million in contributions to equity investments, primarily Eagle Ford and EagleHawk. We've raised about $817 million of equity. The Canada rate case began and a swap on line [ph] largely offset. Coverage was about $2 million positive and then we had $82 million of positive working capital, which was primarily dark premiums, accrued taxes, AP and AR, offset by some inventory purchases in our Transmix business. So that's KMP.
Moving to EPB, and the first page of EPB is also the GAAP income statement. As Rich said, we're declaring a distribution of $0.55 in the quarter. The GAAP income statement recasts our prior period results to include Cheyenne Plains as EPB had owned Cheyenne Plains during all periods presented. So when I go to the next page and we go to our calculation of DCF, it will not -- it will only include Cheyenne Plains for the periods that we owned it. So you can see the incremental impact from the acquisition. DCF calculation, this is going to -- for some of you who follow EPB, it's going to be a little bit of a new format. This format is consistent with KMP's format. I think we -- this is the same answer at the end of the day. It's just done, it's laid out a little bit differently. So more to KMP, we're just taking that income, adding back DD&A and subtracting sustaining CapEx. There are a couple of other adjustments to get to DCF that you'll see at the bottom. Those are consistent with the adjustments that El Paso was making previously.
So DCF before certain items, as Rich mentioned, at $135 million in the quarter, up $17 million in the quarter, up $22 million year-to-date. $135 million is $0.65 on a per-unit basis versus our $0.55 declared distribution, resulting coverage of about $20 million. On the 6 months, the $278 million is $1.35 per unit compared to our declared distribution of $1.06. That's about $60 million. And as Rich mentioned, for the year, we expect to declare distributions of $2.25 and to have coverage in excess of $80 million.
Now just looking at the $17 million, where did that growth come from? If you look out to the segments, the segments were up $17 million, and that's primarily the acquisition of Cheyenne Plains, as well as improved results on Southern Natural as a result of the completed expansion project and greater power demand load. About $17 million, though, because El Paso consolidated the -- all pipelines in prior periods. It didn't own 100% of those pipelines, and so you're seeing the benefit of the acquisition down below in the minority interest line.
So as EPB has bought more of those assets from El Paso, the minority interest decreases. And so you see that benefit down in the minority interest line below. So if you add that, that takes your $17 million, it's about $4 million of benefit from those incremental acquisitions since 2011. So that's $21 million total increase in the assets.
Sustaining CapEx is a positive $17 million in the quarter. That's because there were -- in 2011, there were some nonrecurring maintenance items. There's some timing, which I will get too in a second, and also the cost savings that we've implemented. So you have $38 million of cash flow available. Interest is up by $10 million as a result of the acquisition. GP incentive is up $13 million as a result of these units issued and the increase in the distribution. There's some other items that are about $2 million, and that takes you to the $17 million.
Same analysis for the year-to-date. The segments are up $7 million. The incremental from acquisitions is -- it shows up in the minority interest line, it's about $30 million. That's $37 million total. Sustaining CapEx is $29 million lower. Now on sustaining CapEx, for the full year, what we're expecting is around $55 million to $60 million. So you can see in the quarter and year-to-date, there is some timing relative to the full year. But we do expect -- but we are lower than last year in the quarter.
Interest is up $20 million. GP incentive is up $25 million year-to-date. There is about $1 million of other items, and so that takes you to the increase of $22 million for the year-to-date.
On EPB's balance sheet, the largest change in EPB's balance sheet relates to the drop-down of CIG, the 14% interest in CIG and the Cheyenne Plains. And so you can see that the debt is up about $509 million. And then you also see equity is negative. And those results because we have to recast. And so when we recast those as we own these assets in all periods, when you originally do it, you don't have the financing because they're assuming this happened way in the past. So you put assets on your books. Adding to that, it creates a positive in equity. And then when you go finance these assets that are already on your books for GAAP purposes, that is going to be a negative running through your equity account. And so you can see that happening this quarter.
On a debt-to-EBITDA basis, 4.7x versus 4.1x. Now the debt here on the balance sheet has also been recast for Cheyenne Plains. So the 3.990 at the end of the year is not really what was on the balance sheet at the end of the year. So -- what was on the balance sheet at the end of the year was 3.825. So we're up about $800 million year-to-date, and we're up about 700 -- sorry, we're up $800 million from the quarter. We're up about $750 million year-to-date.
The acquisitions, $635 million went out the door on that, but we also issued equity for $64 million. So $570 million net. We assumed $176 million in debt, there is $23 million in expansion capital, $45 million in the termination of an AR program. Cheyenne Plains came with cash of about $20 million. There's about $20 million of coverage and then there's working capital of about $27 million negative, largely associated with accrued interest. Year-to-date, the acquisition, $635 million. $176 million of debt assumed. $40 million of expansion CapEx, same $45 million on the termination of the AR program, same $20 million of cash. Equity issued, $64 million. Coverage is $60 million and then the working capital is about $4 million. And so that is EPB.
Moving to KMI, just couple of overall comments for those of you who might be new. This is our calculation of cash available to pay dividends at KMI. So what we are showing here is the cash that we received based on the declared distribution at KMP and EPB. It is the cash we -- or the cash available for us from our investment in NGPL. And then this quarter, we have added a second section because now KMI owns assets. And so we've tried to divide the schedule: the top schedule, which I'll call the GP section; and the bottom half, it's what I'll call the assets section. The assets section is assets that we intend to drop over time to KMP and EPB. So it will largely go away over time, and the cash flows will move up into the GP section. Now it's not perfect. There is -- all the interest associated with the El Paso acquisition is on the bottom part of the section. All the cash taxes are in the top part of the section. But if you try to get -- if you ask 5 different people how to allocate this stuff, they do it 5 different ways. So we didn't try to go through an allocation exercise. That's just -- that's so -- just presented it this way for simplicity.
In this schedule, we have full -- there are no transaction costs in the schedule. What we're trying to show here is the recurring cash flow that is available for distribution. So in the quarter, $307 million available for distribution. That's $0.36 a unit -- I mean, per share versus our declared dividend of $0.35 a share. For the 6 months, $610 million, which is $0.79 per share versus $0.67 on a declared basis. The -- we're up, again, $139 million in the quarter, $175 million year-to-date. If you look at what's driving the $139 million, the KMP distribution to us, $393 million, that's up $49 million. The distribution from EPB, $82 million -- up $82 million. And then that's offset somewhat by lower distributions from NGPL, higher interest expense and higher cash taxes, those 3 totaling about $20 million. So the -- you get to about $100 million in cash available to pay dividends before you get to the assets that we own. The assets generated about $38 million. Some of you may say well, that seems kind of low. But remember that all the acquisition interest is allocated to this section. We have already dropped some of the assets to EPB, and the GP and LP contribution from EPB are up above the $80 million.
In the year-to-date, $175 million increase, $767 million is coming from KMP. That's an over $90 million increase. EPB is an $82 million increase. So between the 2 of those, you have about a $170 million increase. NGPL is down a little bit, but NGPL is, for the full year, is consistent with what we budgeted. And so the interest is up a little bit, G&A is up a little bit and cash taxes are up about $20 million to take you to $137 million. Again, we have $38 million from the assets to get you a $175 million increase, which is about 40% increase and the cash available year-to-date.
Moving to the GAAP net income. There's a lot of noise in the -- given all the transaction expenses in the quarter. But our net income attributable to KMI is a $125 million loss. Now in the footnote on the prior page, you can see that there's about $273 million of after-tax expenses associated with EPC transaction and the EPE transaction. There's also a $29 million deferred tax adjustment associated with the transaction. There's $24 million in KMP-certain items that flow through to KMI on an income basis, which is largely KMI's share of the FTC revaluation. And then there's $15 million of other purchase accounting. So if you add those back, which is about $341 million, you get to about $216 million of net income, which is about $0.26 a share. We don't, again, think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful, but I know that some of you are required to sort of port net income.
The next page is the GAAP reconciliation, which I'm not going to go through. I'm just going to spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. And the balance sheet is a consolidated balance sheet. It consolidates KMP, EPB into KMI. This is preliminary. We expect that there will be some movement in this balance sheet given the transaction and finalizing purchase accounting. We expect there'll primarily be re-classes, but there could be some other changes as well.
If you look down to the bottom -- oh, first, the change in total assets is about $38.8 billion. Of that, KMP is about $300 million and really, the remaining change is almost all attributable to the acquisition of El Paso. On the debt balance, KMI's debt balance is about $16.4 billion. That debt balance we expect to come down as we drop assets to KMP over -- in this quarter. But some of that debt will move to KMP as KMP takes on debt to finance the acquisition. But on a consolidated basis and pro forma in the EBITDA for a full year, we expect to end the year slightly over 5x. The change in debt on the quarter is about -- for the year is about $13.128 billion. For the quarter, it's about $13.155 billion. And so I'm going to reconcile that for you quickly.
The transaction, we assumed about $7.3 billion in net debt from EPC. We also issued about $5.4 billion. And then when KMP purchased the other half of Midstream, it caused us to consolidate Midstream's debt on KMI's balance sheet. So that's another $100 million. So that's about $12.8 billion. So it is up $12.827 billion, and then -- so the change in debt is $328 million after you take out those -- the transaction debt assumed or issued.
A performance metric that we went through was $307 million. There's about $146 million of timing on distributions. That means we recognized those distributions in the quarter for the performance metric, but we haven't received the cash yet. And that's higher than what we would anticipate going forward. What we anticipate going forward is about $15 million. It's higher in this quarter, primarily because this is the first quarter that we've gotten a distribution from EPB. We show it on the performance metric, but we don't actually receive that distribution until August.
We paid $226 million in dividends in the quarter. We repurchased about $110 million of warrants. There's $125 million of transaction-related items, primarily severance and retention bonuses and then the termination of the AR financing facility. And then there is about $28 million of other items, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments to get you to your total change of $328 million. So that's all I have."

But we're going to have an expansion at Galena Park pursuant to a new long-term contract that we will be releasing information on tomorrow, as a matter of fact. We're going to have other expansions. Certainly, the Edmonton south terminal, as we say in our release, is actually upscaled again because we had more long-term contracts. I think the BOSTCO facility on the ship channel will also probably be upsized because we think we're about to move beyond 6.6 million barrels that was our original anticipated amount of tankage. We think we'll be able to expand that. So just a lot of opportunities. Again, we'll look at it based on whether they clear our return on capital targets and whether we have good long-term contracts behind them."

So you get $800 million of equity that is sort of -- happens automatically before you even need to go to the market.

And in fact, there was an article in one",470,"Yes, and those of you who follow it closely, the Premier Harper -- Prime Minister Harper's government has said that they want a full environmental review of these projects, but they want it done on a timely basis. And in fact, there was an article in one of the trade regs this morning saying that the NEB was taking steps in that regard and was looking at an 18-month time horizon for saying yes or no on projects, no matter how complicated they might be. Now I'm always leery when you just set some time frame. But I think, clearly, future projects like Trans Mountain, from the time you file, are not going to be dragged out for 3 or 4 years and have thousands of hours of hearings. I think it -- everyone will have their say at the table, but I think it will be done in a very fair but expedited basis. So we believe it will be done quickly. Now what we have done is, as many of you know, is we have filed with the NEB for approval of the commercial contracts. In other words, what we're doing is converting a pipeline that now moves 300,000 barrels a day and is essentially an open-access pipeline. Now we're expanding it dramatically and we have 500,000-plus barrels that is subscribed under 20-year contracts, clearly leaving plenty of room to handle all of the spot bases. You got 240,000 barrels, 750,000 minus 510,000, to handle all the other business. But we want to get that approved to make sure the NEB agrees with our commercial efforts here, our commercial understandings that we have reached in binding agreements with our customers. In the meantime, we are already going through what's called a consulting project with various interested parties, including NGOs, including the First Nations groups, primarily in British Columbia, and then we will file for the actual permitting of the pipeline itself in late 2013, and that's when the -- when that process will start. And again, if you assume 18 months and that may not be the exact right time, you assume 18 months, you file late in 2013, that would you get you approval in the mid-2015 time horizon, give us time to build it in 2015 and 2016. So that's kind of the game plan, nothing -- no rocket science here. But there has been some very positive developments from the standpoint of the Canadian national government saying these are very important assets. It's not just oil sands production, it's some of the mineral production in British Columbia, some of the potash in Saskatchewan, other areas of Canada where they want to make sure that they have an orderly process to consider these. And I think that, that's going to be a positive for our process."

Those that can move up or down with the events we can't control will be subject to a pass-through arrangement. There'll be a non-control cost. So we think we've got a pretty workable solution there.

We will be back to being a pure GP. Now part of the reason for that is that the sale that was mandated by the FTC is somewhat larger than we thought it would be and, therefore, KMP can move more quickly. It has more proceeds coming in than we anticipated. It can move more quickly to take on more assets.

Now that we have closed the El Paso merger, w",2341,"Okay. Thank you, Holly. This is the Kinder Morgan earnings call and, as usual, we'll be making statements that may fall within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Now that we have closed the El Paso merger, we'll be talking about 3 entities: KMI, Kinder Morgan, Inc.; KMP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners; and EPB, Enron -- I mean, El Paso Pipeline Partners. In addition, of course, there's a fourth security, KMR, which is the equivalent of KMP, but is -- pays its dividends in FICC and is suitable for investors who do not want to hold an MLP.
Kim will take you through the financial details, and there's a good bit of noise there resulting from the El Paso merger and from the FTC mandated sale. But I think there's a strong fundamental story in most respects. For those of you new to this call, and to the Kinder Morgan philosophy, we're all about generating cash and paying out that cash to shareholders in distributions or dividends. So the real news here, I think, is that all 3 entities increased their dividends or distributions for the second quarter.
KMI increased its dividend to $0.35. Now that's up 17% since the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate dividending $1.40 for the year 2012. KMP and KMR raised their distribution to $1.23 per quarter. That's up 7% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate distributing $4.98 for the year at KMP and KMR. EPB increased its dividend to $0.55. That's up 15% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate paying dividends of $2.25 for calendar year 2012.
Now let me talk about each of the 3 entities briefly, before I turn it over to Kim. At KMI, the cash available for dividends this quarter was $307 million. That's up 83% from the $168 million in the second quarter of 2011. If you look at it on the basis of cash available for dividends per share, it's $0.36 this quarter versus $0.24 in the second quarter of 2011. And I might add that for the full year 2012 at KMI, we expect to generate over $1.3 billion in cash available for dividends.
Obviously, the most important thing that occurred during the second quarter this year was the completion of the El Paso acquisition on May 24. As we promised, in conjunction with that acquisition, we sold off the E&P assets of El Paso for approximately $7.2 billion. We had originally targeted producing $350 million of cost savings per year. We now expect that number to be north of $400 million per year.
We said we would drop down significant assets to EPB, and we did that just prior to the close by dropping down the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate and all of the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline. We expect to drop down 100% of Tennessee, TGP, and 50% of El Paso Natural Gas to KMP during this third quarter. And I might add that we really believe that TGP, obviously, has just a unique footprint in the Marcellus and Utica. We expect to complete the FTC mandated sales of certain KMP Rockies pipelines during the third quarter also.
It's early in the game. We've only had these assets for a little less than 2 months. But so far, the assimilation is going well. We're seeing real upside possibilities from the assets, and we think we've inherited, most importantly, a great number of really good people. There are some profound effects that this merger has and, just to give you a couple of them, it now makes gas pipelines and storage across all 3 of the entities about 60% of all the earnings before DD&A. So we've become much more of a gas pipeline company, obviously.
And then secondly, by putting all these companies together, if you look at enterprise value on a combined basis, at yesterday's close, the total enterprise value of these 3 entities is right at $100 billion. So this is quite a company we've assembled, with a footprint that I think is going to pay enormous dividends for years to come.
Now let me turn to KMP. There the distributable cash flow increased by 13% to $366 million. Of course, the key thing for us is distributable cash flow per unit, and that is up to $1.07 versus $1.01 in Q2 of 2011. All the segments were positive in comparison to the second quarter of 2011 in terms of earnings before DD&A prior to certain items, with the exception of the Products Pipeline segment, which was burdened by lower rates on SFPP as a result of FERC and CPUC decisions and settlements.
If you look at how the underlying business has performed, and I think sometimes we're kind of a microcosm of the economy, I can give you some interesting statistics. On the refined products volumes, we were off 0.9% in terms of throughput for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period a year ago. And coincidentally, that's exactly equal to the EIA numbers recently published for the second quarter.
In terms of NGL volumes, our performance was much better. We were up 27%, largely through increased volumes on our Cochin and Cypress systems. We increased our biofuels volumes, and we're still handling about 30% of all the ethanol consumed in the United States. If you look at some of our terminal activities, we continue to benefit from strong coal export volumes, offset somewhat by weaker domestic coal volumes. Overall, coal volumes in our Terminals group was up 12%.
Our petcoke volumes were also up 12%. Steel was up a much more modest 2%. And I think, returning to coal for just a minute, we believe that for the full year 2012, we will handle over 20 million tons of coal for export at our 4 export terminals, 2 on the Houston Ship Channel, 1 on the Mississippi, south of New Orleans; and the other in the Newport News, Virginia area. And that's about 20% of all the coal exported from the United States anticipated for calendar year 2012. The throughput on our liquids terminals was also positive, up about 5%.
Turning to our Natural Gas segment, natural gas transport volumes were up 6% compared to the quarter a year ago. Natural gas sales volumes, virtually all in Texas, were up 12% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And the big drivers for that 12% increase were increased power demand and increased exports to Mexico. But as we look across all of our pipelines, the power demand is very high. We're setting records both for the month and year-to-date in terms of gas delivery to the power demand on both Tennessee and on the Southern Natural Gas systems.
Now all that sounds pretty rosy, but life is never that way. And let me just say that not all is rosy in terms of volumes of natural gas throughput. Clearly, as you can imagine, the volumes are below budget on our dry gas activities, particularly in the Haynesville play, what we call our KinderHawk facility. But I will say that our EBITDA there is still nicely above the EBITDA in our acquisition model when we bought the second half of KinderHawk from Petrohawk back in the middle of 2011. So we're below plan in terms of volumes and EBITDA but above our acquisition model in terms of EBITDA.
We're also seeing some producer delays in getting Eagle Ford production into our pipeline systems. I think largely this is the inability of producers to get equipment delivered on a timely basis, and just the sheer volume of activity there, I think, is creating some bottlenecks. But volumes are certainly there. We have long-term throughput contracts. But in some cases, the ramp-up is going more slowly in terms of getting the volumes to us than we would have anticipated it would be.
In our CO2 segment, the production volumes are pretty good. SACROC is up 1,600 barrels a day from quarter 1 of 2012 and about flat to quarter 2 of 2011. Cash volumes are obviously way up above the second quarter of 2011 as that particular field ramps up, but still slightly below our plan for the second quarter of 2012.
Gross NGL production is at record levels, and this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had record levels. So in short, the operations in the CO segment are doing pretty well, and we expect the rest of the year to continue strong from a production standpoint. The headwind in this section, which would come as no news to any of you who follow the midstream energy business, is the deterioration in NGL prices, and they're clearly substantially lower than the numbers we had in the budget, which was based on outlook dating from last November. Now we're not quite as bad as some. We estimate now, we put this in the release, that if the present trends were to hold through the year, our NGL price would be down by about 23%. So we're not as bad as some others because we do have less ethane in our mix. But overall, there's no question that that's a headwind for our CO2 segment.
On the sales and transportation side, demand for CO2 remains strong, and we continue to work to expand our source fields, both in Southwest Colorado and to develop our newest source field, the St. John's field, which is on the Arizona-New Mexico border.
In Canada, the Trans Mountain volumes were up slightly from the second quarter of 2011, and we expect to have those volumes hold in for the rest of the year. Probably the most important development at KMP and perhaps throughout the whole Kinder Morgan family of companies is the tremendous project development that we're seeing. We've made a lot of progress on these projects, and we're now estimating that our project backlog is now approaching $10 billion. The bulk of that is at KMP, but some is in the assets we still hold at KMI and some is in the EPB assets. But a huge backlog of products, and we -- those are already either approved, or we expect to approve them with the board very shortly. And it's money that will be spent not just in 2012, obviously, but over the next 3 or 4 years. All of these projects are backed by long-term contracts with our shippers, which is obviously a critical thing for us.
Now we've detailed the most important of the projects that have been approved in the earnings release, and I won't go through them, but I think they bode very well for future cash flow. Let me just give you a few numbers to remember. Not counting the drop-downs of Tennessee and EPNG, which again we expect to occur this quarter, nor the CapEx associated with those drop-downs, not counting those, we expect KMP to invest about $2.2 billion in expansions and acquisitions this year, up from our original estimate of about $1.5 billion. And remember, that's just for 2012.
If you look at it a little more -- in a little more detail, Terminals alone has approved projects of more than $1.3 billion, and much of that money will be spent in '13 and '14, not just in 2012. In the Products Pipelines, 3 of the projects that we outline in the release, namely the Houston condensate splitter, the Parkway Pipeline and the Cochin Reversal project, those 3 projects alone total almost $700 million in CapEx, most of which will be spent in '13 and '14. And if you add all of the projects that have been approved for the Products Pipelines group, it's more like $800 million.
Now beyond all these projects that are underway and approved and advancing quickly is, of course, the Trans Mountain Expansion project in Canada. We now have contracts with 9 shippers for approximately 510,000 barrels per day for 20 years. That allows us to plan an expansion from the present capacity of 300,000 barrels a day to 750,000 barrels a day. Now there'll be a long regulatory process, although I would add that recent developments have indicated that the Canadian national government is very intent on streamlining that process. But we expect to get this approval, and we expect to spend the $4.1 billion to bring this project to completion.
We think it will be built in the 2015, 2016 time frame, assuming regulatory approval, and be in service sometime in early 2017. Now all these projects, when you count them all up, are just tremendous building blocks for the future, and I think that's what we'll need more than any other single factor to continue growth at all 3 of these entities.
Now turning to EPB, there, the DCF is up 14% to $135 million for the second quarter of 2012. Again, the more key figure is the DCF per unit and is 65% this quarter versus $0.60 a year ago. During the quarter, the most significant single event was the completion of the drop-down that I detailed earlier. But we also completed the third and final phase of Southern Natural Gas's system 3, and that expansion was placed in service in June. All 3 of those phases together resulted in additional capacity on the system of about 375 million cubic feet a day, and that's all subscribed to by the Southern companies for electric generation mode.
From a broader perspective on EPB, we're just starting the process of assimilating these assets, but we're really very encouraged by the step-out expansion opportunities; by opportunities for storage, both in the Southeast and the Rockies; and by potential LNG export opportunities. We think EPB will also benefit from its share of these reduced costs, which we've been able to put into effect across the entire Kinder Morgan companies. So that's an update on where we stand. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,214245593,327047,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Rich. Okay, I'm going to start with the numbers on KMP. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking at the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement, we don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful. We",3828,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. Okay, I'm going to start with the numbers on KMP. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking at the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement, we don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful. We're going to focus on our calculation of EPS. But a few things I want to point out here, one, we're declaring a distribution today of $1.23. That's up about 7% from the second quarter of last year. The other thing on the GAAP income statement, you will see that there is an incremental loss on the remeasurement of our discounts -- that's the FTC assets -- to adjust them to fair value. That's $327 million. That's noncash. When we go to the DCF calculation, you'll see that we exclude that. However, right above that, you'll see the income from discontinued operations, the $48 million. When we calculate DCF because we still own those assets and we get those cash flows, we include that in our calculation of DCF.
So on the second page, towards the bottom of the page, you can see our DCF before certain items. As Rich mentioned, $366 million in the quarter, up $42 million or 13%. For the 6 months, $828 million, up $122 million. Now just to back up one second, what we're doing in calculating DCF is we're taking GAAP net income before certain items, the primarily -- the primary certain item is the loss on remeasurement that I just mentioned. We're adding back DD&A, including our share of DD&A. We're making some other small adjustments, book cash taxes and some other small adjustments, taking out sustaining CapEx to get us to what our DCF is. So that is $366 million in the quarter. That's about $1.07 per unit. That compares to the distribution that we're declaring today of $1.23. So we have negative coverage in the quarter, which is -- we expected. We told you that, that would be the case, so it's last quarter and it's the time we went over the budget.
For the 6 months, $2.44 of distributable cash flow per unit compared to a distribution of $2.43. So slightly positive on coverage for the 6 months. For the full year, on coverage, what we're expecting is to be at 1x coverage or maybe slightly under that. And I'll go through in a minute as I go through where we are relative to our budget, but that's primarily a function of lower NGL prices and then lower results, operating results from our KinderHawk assets.
So looking back up at the segment, $959 million in segment earnings before DD&A, up $107 million in the quarter, up $257 million year-to-date. The Products Pipelines, as Rich mentioned, down $9 million in the quarter, down $13 million year-to-date on an actual basis. That is primarily a function of the lower rates on Pacific. We do have lower performance on our Transmix business as we had a contract expire there, but that's largely offset by a favorable on Cochin as a result of a settlement with our shippers.
The same factors are driving the year-to-date. With respect to the budget, we're very close to the budget year-to-date. For the year, we expect to end slightly below the budget. Natural Gas segment's up $47 million in the quarter. It's up $103 million year-to-date, and that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, the SouthTex acquisition and just favorable results in our trading business and our Fayetteville Express Pipeline, as volumes ramped during 2011.
With respect to our budget year-to-date on Natural Gas, we're below our budget, primarily as a result of KinderHawk. And then as things progressing more slowly in the Eagle Ford as Rich mentioned. For the year, on Natural Gas, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the drop-downs. And so absent the drop-downs, we would expect that we would end below our budget, primarily as a function of KinderHawk.
CO2 business is up $52 million in the quarter. It's up $131 million year-to-date. Obviously, oil price is up. Our oil volumes in the quarter are up about 800 barrels per day, largely as a result of caps. Our NGL volumes are up in the quarter, about 1,100 barrels a day, and then that's slightly offset by lower NGL prices. The same is true for the quarter except for the oil volume is flat. So the same factors, except the oil volume.
Year-to-date, we are below budget on CO2, and that's a function -- oil production is, as I said, about 850 barrels per day below our budget. However, for the full year, given SACROC, the improved performance of SACROC, we're expecting to end pretty close to our production budget. And so for the full year, we're expecting CO2 to come in about 5% below its budget, and that is primarily a factor of lower NGL prices.
Terminals up $17 million in the quarter, up $34 million year-to-date. 80% of that is internal growth in the quarter, primarily higher volumes on our liquids terminals, higher rates and expansions on our liquids terminals, higher coal, export coal volumes and higher petcoke volumes. And the same factors are largely true on the year-to-date basis. Year-to-date, Terminals is on budget. And for the year, we expect them to exceed their budget, primarily due to higher export coal volumes.
Kinder Morgan Canada is flat in the quarter. It's up about $2 million year-to-date. They're slightly exceeding their budget year-to-date, and we expect for the year that they will slightly exceed their budget.
Dropping down to G&A, which is about in the middle of your page, G&A is down $2 million versus -- I'm sorry, is up $2 million versus last year. It's up $10 million versus last year, year-to-date. It's on budget year-to-date. And -- but for the year, we expect it to be above its budget. And we expect to be its -- for it to be above its budget largely as a result of the drop-downs of GDP and EPNG. Absent the drop-downs, we would come in under our budget on G&A, primarily as a function of higher capitalized overhead as capital expenditures have increased to the $2.2 billion that Rich mentioned before.
Interest expense, up $12 million versus the second quarter last year, up $19 million year-to-date. That's primarily a function of the higher balance. Our balance is up about $1.3 billion. Year-to-date, we are favorable to budget as a result of lower rates. For the full year, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the acquisitions. If you strip out the acquisitions, we would expect that interest expense would be favorable versus our budget, also as a function of lower rates.
Sustaining CapEx in the quarter is up $3 million. So higher spending in the quarter than a year ago. It's also up year-to-date. Versus our budget year-to-date, we're actually favorable. We've spent less than we anticipated. Some of that is timing. But for the full year, we expect sustaining capital to be above our budget, and that's also a function of the acquisitions. Our full year forecast does build in the impact of the drop-downs and from KMI, as well as the FTC divestitures. We think we'll be in the range of $55 million higher than our budget. If you strip out the acquisitions, we would come in favorable to budget. Primarily, some has moved -- some of the sustaining CapEx has moved to O&M and then there is a small amount of savings and deferrals.
So that is the DCF for the quarter. I'll move to the balance sheet. The balance sheet -- I'm just going to focus on the debt. $12.6 billion is our net debt in the quarter. That results in a debt to EBITDA of 3.4x. That's down from year end of 3.6x and down from last quarter at 3.5x. We expect to end the year at about 3.9x debt to EBITDA, but that also has all the debt associated with the drop-down transactions and only a partial year of the operating results. So if you pro forma the EBITDA for a full year, so you take out the FTC assets and you put in a full year of TGP and EPNG, we would end the year at 3.7x.
The change in debt for the quarter is about $55 million. For the year-to-date, it's about $223 million. And just to go through the main drivers of that, on the quarter, we had about $730 million of spending. It was $400 million of expansion CapEx, about $300 million of acquisitions and about $35 million of contributions to equity investments.
We issued equity of $578 million. That's KMR. That's KMP at the market. We issued about $300 million in the Midstream transaction. We had a rate case settlement payment of $54 million. We unwound a swap that largely offset that. That was a positive $53 million. Our coverage was negative $56 million and then we had a working capital positive of $157 million. And that is primarily accrued interest.
Year-to-date, $223 million change in debt. We spent a little over $1.1 billion year-to-date. That's about $700 million in expansion, $330 million in acquisitions, the biggest acquisition being the $300 million Midstream acquisition, and about $86 million in contributions to equity investments, primarily Eagle Ford and EagleHawk. We raised about $817 million of equity. The Canada rate case began and a swap on line [ph] largely offset. Coverage was about $2 million positive and then we had $82 million of positive working capital, which was primarily dark [ph] premiums, accrued taxes, AP and AR, offset by some inventory purchases in our Transmix business. So that's KMP.
Moving to EPB, and the first page of EPB is also the GAAP income statement. As Rich said, we're declaring a distribution of $0.55 in the quarter. The GAAP income statement recasts our prior period results to include Cheyenne Plains as if EPB had owned Cheyenne Plains during all periods presented. So when I go to the next page and we go to our calculation of DCF, it will not -- it will only include Cheyenne Plains for the periods that we owned it. So you can see the incremental impact from the acquisition. DCF calculation, this is going to -- for some of you who follow EPB, it's going to be a little bit of a new format. This format is consistent with KMP's format. I think we get to the same answer at the end of the day, it's just done -- it's laid out a little bit differently. So more to KMP, we're just taking that income, adding back DD&A and subtracting sustaining CapEx. There are a couple of other adjustments to get to DCF that you'll see at the bottom. Those are consistent with the adjustments that El Paso was making previously.
So DCF before certain items, as Rich mentioned, at $135 million in the quarter, up $17 million in the quarter, up $22 million year-to-date. $135 million is $0.65 on a per-unit basis versus our $0.55 declared distribution, results in coverage of about $20 million. On the 6 months, the $278 million is $1.35 per unit compared to our declared distribution of $1.06. That's about $60 million. And as Rich mentioned, for the year, we expect to declare distributions of $2.25 and to have coverage in excess of $80 million.
Now just looking at the $17 million, where did that growth come from? If you look out at the segments, the segments were up $17 million, and that's primarily the acquisition of Cheyenne Plains, as well as improved results on Southern Natural as a result of the completed expansion project and greater power demand load. That $17 million, though, because El Paso consolidated the -- all the pipelines in prior periods, it didn't own 100% of those pipelines, and so you're seeing the benefit of the acquisition down below in the minority interest line.
So as EPB has bought more of those assets from El Paso, the minority interest decreases. And so you see that benefit down in the minority interest line below. So if you add that, that takes your $17 million, there's about $4 million of benefit from those incremental acquisitions since 2011. So that's $21 million total increase in the assets.
Sustaining CapEx is a positive $17 million in the quarter. That's because there were -- in 2011, there were some nonrecurring maintenance items. There's some timing, which I will get to in a second, and also the cost savings that we've implemented. So we have $38 million of cash flow available. Interest is up by $10 million as a result of the acquisition. GP incentive is up $13 million as a result of these units issued and the increase in the distribution. There's some other items that are about $2 million, and that takes you to the $17 million.
Same analysis for the year-to-date. The segments are up $7 million. The incremental from acquisitions is -- it shows up in the minority interest line, is about $30 million. That's $37 million total. Sustaining CapEx is $29 million lower. Now on sustaining CapEx, for the full year, what we're expecting is around $55 million to $60 million. So you can see in the quarter and year-to-date, there is some timing relative to the full year. But we do expect -- but we are lower than last year in the quarter.
Interest is up $20 million. GP incentive is up $25 million year-to-date. There is about $1 million of other items, and so that takes you to the increase of $22 million for the year-to-date.
On EPB's balance sheet, the largest change in EPB's balance sheet relates to the drop-down of CIG, the 14% interest in CIG and the Cheyenne Plains. And so you can see that the debt is up about $509 million. And then you also see equity is negative. And those results because we have to recast. And so when we recast this as we own these assets in all periods, when you originally do it, you don't have the financing because they're assuming this happened way in the past. So you put assets on your books. Adding to that, creates a positive in equity. And then when you go finance these assets that are already on your books for GAAP purposes, that is going to be a negative running through your equity account. And so you can see that happening this quarter.
On a debt-to-EBITDA basis, 4.7x versus 4.1x. Now the debt here on the balance sheet has also been recast for Cheyenne Plains. So the 3.990 at the end of the year is not really what was on the balance sheet at the end of the year. So -- what was on the balance sheet at the end of the year was 3.825. So we're up about $800 million year-to-date, and we're up about 700 -- sorry, we're up $800 million from the quarter. We're up about $750 million year-to-date.
The acquisitions, $635 million went out the door on that, but we also issued equity for $64 million. So $570 million net. We assumed $176 million in debt, there is $23 million in expansion capital, $45 million in the termination of an AR program. Cheyenne Plains came with cash of about $20 million. There's about $20 million of coverage and then there's working capital of about $27 million negative, largely associated with accrued interest. Year-to-date, the acquisition, $635 million. $176 million of debt assumed. $40 million of expansion CapEx, same $45 million on the termination of the AR program, same $20 million of cash. Equity issued, $64 million. Coverage is $60 million and then the working capital is about $4 million. And so that is EPB.
Moving to KMI, just couple of overall comments for those of you who might be new. This is our calculation of cash available to pay dividends at KMI. So what we are showing here is the cash that we received based on the declared distribution at KMP and EPB. It is the cash we -- or the cash available for us from our investment in NGPL. And then this quarter, we have added a second section because now KMI owns assets. And so we've tried to divide the schedule: the top schedule, which I'll -- the top half of the schedule, which I'll call the GP section; and the bottom half is what I'll call the asset section. The asset section is assets that we intend to drop over time to KMP and EPB. So it will largely go away over time, and the cash flows will move up into the GP section. Now it's not perfect. There is -- all the interest associated with the El Paso acquisition is in the bottom part of the section. All the cash taxes are in the top part of the section. But if you try to get -- if you ask 5 different people how to allocate this stuff, they do it 5 different ways. So we didn't try to go through an allocation exercise. That's just -- that's so -- just presented it this way for simplicity.
In this schedule, we have full -- there are no transaction costs in the schedule. What we're trying to show here is the recurring cash flow that is available for distribution. So in the quarter, $307 million available for distribution. That's $0.36 a unit -- I mean, per share versus our declared dividend of $0.35 a share. For the 6 months, $610 million, which is $0.79 per share versus $0.67 on a declared basis. The -- we're up, again, $139 million in the quarter, $175 million year-to-date. If you look at what's driving the $139 million, the KMP distribution to us, $393 million, that's up $49 million. The distribution from EPB, $82 million -- up $82 million. And then that's offset somewhat by lower distributions from NGPL, higher interest expense and higher cash taxes, those 3 totaling about $20 million. So the -- you get to about $100 million in cash available to pay dividends before you get to the assets that we own. The assets generated about $38 million. Some of you may say well, that seems kind of low. But remember that all the acquisition interest is allocated to this section. We have already dropped some of the assets to EPB, and the GP and LP contribution from EPB are up above the $80 million.
In the year-to-date, $175 million increase, $767 million is coming from KMP. That's over a $90 million increase. EPB is an $82 million increase. So between the 2 of those, you have about a $170 million increase. NGPL is down a little bit, but NGPL is, for the full year, is consistent with what we budgeted. And so the interest is up a little bit, G&A is up a little bit and cash taxes are up about $20 million to take you to $137 million. Again, we have $38 million from the assets to get you a $175 million increase, which is about 40% increase in the cash available year-to-date.
Moving to the GAAP net income. There's a lot of noise in the -- given all the transaction expenses in the quarter. But our net income attributable to KMI is a $125 million loss. Now in the footnote on the prior page, you can see that there's about $273 million of after-tax expenses associated with EPC transaction and the EPE transaction. There's also a $29 million deferred tax adjustment associated with the transaction. There's $24 million in KMP-certain items that flow through to KMI on an income basis, which is largely KMI's share of the FTC revaluation. And then there's $15 million of other purchase accounting. So if you add those back, which is about $341 million, you get to about $216 million of net income, which is about $0.26 a share. We don't, again, think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful, but I know that some of you are required to report net income.
The next page is the GAAP reconciliation, which I'm not going to go through. I'm just going to spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. And the balance sheet is a consolidated balance sheet. It consolidates KMP, EPB into KMI. This is preliminary. We expect that there will be some movement in this balance sheet given the transaction and finalizing purchase accounting. We expect there'll primarily be re-classes, but there could be some other changes as well.
If you look down to the bottom -- oh, first, the change in total assets is about $38.8 billion. Of that, KMP is about $300 million and really, the remaining change is almost all attributable to the acquisition of El Paso. On the debt balance, KMI's debt balance is about $16.4 billion. That debt balance we expect to come down as we drop assets to KMP over -- in this quarter. But some of that debt will move to KMP as KMP takes on debt to finance the acquisition. But on a consolidated basis and pro forma-ing the EBITDA for a full year, we expect to end the year slightly over 5x. The change in debt on the quarter is about -- for the year is about $13.128 billion. For the quarter, it's about $13.155 billion. And so I'm going to reconcile that for you quickly.
The transaction, we assumed about $7.3 billion in net debt from EPC. We also issued about $5.4 billion. And then when KMP purchased the other half of Midstream, it caused us to consolidate Midstream's debt on KMI's balance sheet. So that's another $100 million. So that's about $12.8 billion. So it is up $12.827 billion, and then -- so the change in debt is $328 million after you take out those -- the transaction debt assumed or issued.
The performance metric that we went through was $307 million. There's about $146 million of timing on distributions. That means we recognized those distributions in the quarter for the performance metric, but we haven't received the cash yet. And that's higher than what we would anticipate going forward. What we anticipate going forward is about $15 million. It's higher in this quarter, primarily because this is the first quarter that we've gotten a distribution from EPB. We show it on the performance metric, but we don't actually receive that distribution until August.
We paid $226 million in dividends in the quarter. We repurchased about $110 million of warrants. There's $125 million of transaction-related items, primarily severance and retention bonuses and then the termination of the AR financing facility. And then there is about $28 million of other items, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments to get you to your total change of $328 million. So that's all I have."

Certainly, the Edmonton South terminal, as we say in our release, is actually upscaled again because we had more long-term contracts. I think the BOSTCO facility on the ship channel will also probably be upsized because we think we're about to move beyond 6.6 million barrels that was our original anticipated amount of tankage. We think we'll be able to expand that. So just a lot of opportunities.

Now we're expanding it dramatically and we have 500,000-plus barrels that is subscribed under 20-year contracts, clearly leaving plenty of room to handle all of the spot bases. You got 240,000 barrels, 750,000 minus 510,000, to handle all the other business. But we want to get that approved to make sure the NEB agrees with our commercial efforts here, our commercial understandings that we have reached in binding agreements with our customers. In the meantime, we are already going through what's called a consulting project with various interested parties, including NGOs, including the First Nations groups, primarily in British Columbia, and then we will file for the actual permitting of the pipeline itself in late 2013, and that's when the -- when that process will start. And again, if you assume 18 months and that may not be the exact right time, you assume 18 months, you file late in 2013, that would get you approval in the mid-2015 time horizon, give us time to build it in 2015 and 2016. So that's kind of the game plan, nothing -- no rocket science here. But there has been some very positive developments from the standpoint of the Canadian national government saying these are very important assets. It's not just oil sands production, it's some of the mineral production in British Columbia, some of the potash in Saskatchewan, other areas of Canada where they want to make sure that they have an orderly process to consider these. And I think that, that's going to be a positive for our process."

From the cost side, as we've done in our other projects in Canada, there are cost-sharing mechanisms that -- some of this more locked-in cost will not be subject to escalation or pass-through. Those that can move up or down with events we can't control will be subject to a pass-through arrangement. There'll be a non-control cost. So we think we've got a pretty workable solution there. This is what we did on the last time we expanded Trans Mountain from roughly 220,000 barrels up to 300,000. And it worked very well."

I'm looking forward to the day when Kim will be able to give you a much simpler summary of how we get to cash available for dividends at KMI, and it will be simply all the GP and units. We will be back to being a pure GP. Now part of the reason for that is that the sale that was mandated by the FTC is somewhat larger than we thought it would be and, therefore, KMP can move more quickly. It has more proceeds coming in than we anticipated. It can move more quickly to take on more assets. But we think we can move this pretty quickly, and we're anxious to get back to a pure GP, where you can evaluate it just on that basis."

But the combined entity, all the Kinder Morgan companies, now have about 680 Bcf of gas storage capacity, and we think there are enormous opportunities there to use that more efficiently, to create more injection and withdrawal capacity, serve our customers better, and we've got a full court press on that. And I don't know if you want to call that midstream exactly, but certainly it gives us a lot of additional opportunities.

We have publicly surfaced already about 3 of those projects, and we think that -- not only does that have the benefit of allowing us to earn money on incremental investments as we build, if you will, drops or laterals down to the border off of the EPNG mainline, but it also obviously puts more volume through the EPNG mainline. And I think we -- that will be a big source of opportunity for us. I think, also, you will have some east of California coal-fired generation that we'll be converting to natural gas as time goes on, and I believe there may be some potential for alternative uses.

Thank you, Craig and welcome to the Kinder Morgan third quarter analyst call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll refer to as KMI; Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which I'll refer to as KMP; and El Paso Pipeline Partners, which I would free to as EPB. Together, these 3 companies make up the Kinder Morgan family of companies. We own and operate pipelines and terminals. We're the largest midstream energy company in North America and the third largest energy company of any kind in North America, with an enterprise -- combined enterprise value of about $100 billion. I'll give an overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer, who will go through the detailed financials. And then we'll open for questions and we've got our senior management team here, ready to answer any questions you may have. I'm going to try to be briefer than normal, so we have more time for question and answer. I know particularly in the East, it gets a little late when these calls gets going.
Post the El Paso merger, we've noted in each call, we have additional participants on the line. So I think it's important that I sort of remind you of the philosophy of Kinder Morgan and the way we operate. We own and operate assets, about 75,000 miles of pipelines and 180 plus terminals around North America. These assets produce large amounts of cash flow and our primary goal is to grow that cash flow and distribute it to our unitholders at KMP and EPB and to our shareholders at KMI. At our 2 MLPs, we view the key measurement as being distributable cash flow per unit and at KMI, it's cash available per dividends per share.
Post the El Paso acquisition, we said that between 2011 using that as the base year and 2015, we could grow dividends per share at KMI by about 12.5% per year, and we could grow distributions per unit at KMP and its sister security, KMR, by about 7% per year and we could grow distributions at PBB by about 9%. And we still expect to achieve those goals. Consistent with our philosophy and goals, all 3 of our entities raised their distributions and all 3 improved the cash available per share or unit by measurable amounts during this past quarter. Let me start with KMI.
We raised the dividend to $0.36 per share. That's up 20% from the dividend rate a year ago, and represents $1.44 on an annualized basis. Our cash available for dividends increased by 93% from the third quarter of '11, and year-to-date, it increased to $972 million from $623 million during the first 9 months of '11. That's an increase of 56%. We expect to generate cash available for dividends well in excess of $1.325 billion for the full year 2012, and declared dividends and to declare dividends of at least $1.40. $1.40 would be an increase of 17% from the $1.20 that we declared in 2011. On a per share basis, which as I said, is the most relevant measure, the cash available increase from the third quarter a year ago by 30%. It went from $0.27 to $0.35. And if you looked at that 3 quarters in the year-to-date, the increase was 28% from $0.88 in 2011 to $1.13 in 2012 for the first 3 quarters.
Driving this performance, KMI benefited from strong performance by KMP and EPB, and from the assets acquired from El Paso that are still housed at KMI prior to being dropped down to KMP and EPB. We continue to be pleased with the El Paso assets and their integration in the Kinder Morgan family, and we're on our way to achieving annual cost savings of more than $400 million compared to our original estimate of $350 million.
Now there are some other significant developments at KMI during the quarter. First, in August, KMI completed the drop-down of 100% interest in Tennessee Gas Pipeline and a 50% interest in El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to KMP for $6.22 billion, including assumed debt. Secondly, we expect the FTC mandated sale of certain of KMP's Rocky Mountain assets, which we had to sell to close the merger with El Paso. We expect that divestiture to be closed during November of this year. And third, just last week on October 11, Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings sold the remaining portion of their KMI stock. As you probably know, neither KMI nor any of KMI management sold any shares, and that leaves now only high star from the original investor group, and they have about 8% of the shares outstanding at KMI.
At KMP, we increased the quarterly distribution to $1.26 per unit. That's $504 annualized, that's up 9% over the third quarter a year ago. And again, coming back to the most important measure of the distributable cash flow per unit before certain items, at KMP, it was $1.28 versus $1.19 last year on an increase of 8%. Year-to-date numbers on the same per unit basis were $3.72 versus $3.40 a year ago and that's an increase of 9%. Driving that growth, all 5 of our business segments at KMP reported better results than in the third quarter of '11. The main drivers included the following: first, at the gas group, obviously, the contributions from the drop-down of TGP and EPNG, which were accomplished in early August of this quarter; second, at the Terminals group, a record export coal volumes again, this quarter; and third, in our CO2 segment, strong oil production at SACROC and very good NGL production during the quarter.
Now if you look across KMP and include the other KM companies, we now have over $11 billion of expansion projects in the works. These are projects that have customer commitments or we're very close to having customers commitments on them and they're in various stages of preparation and construction. The great bulk of that 11 plus billion dollars is at KMP. We talked last quarter about having approximately $10 billion. That number has now escalated by well over $1 billion. We made progress on virtually all of these projects in the third quarter, and that progress is outlined in some detail in our release and in the interest of time, I won't go into it right now.
In addition, we continue to pursue additional opportunities which appeared to be numerous and growing. If you look at general trends that impacted all of the Kinder Morgan companies, on the positive side, we had a strong increase in natural gas used in electric generation. Now let me give you some numbers that I find a little bit astounding. On our Tennessee system, for the quarter, throughput utilized for natural gas demand -- natural gas power demand was up 8% for the quarter, and 20% year-to-date. On our Southern Natural Gas system, the Sonat system in the southeastern United States, we're up 26% for the quarter and 47% year-to-date. On the Colorado Interstate system, we were up 13% for the quarter and 44% year-to-date. So really strong growth in the utilization of our pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to be used for electric generation purposes.
A second positive trend that we've seen is a strong and growing market for CO2 to be used in tertiary recovery, particularly in the Permian Basin. We've mentioned that for several quarters now, and as we've detailed, we have a number of projects to hopefully capture additional portions of that demand. Third positive trend line has been export coal. That remains strong at our Terminals in both on the East Coast and along the Gulf Coast. And a fourth positive is that, as we all know, there's lots of drilling in the wet gas shale plays, and that additional drilling and production is leading to increased demand for the kind of infrastructure that we have in our footprint. Now I don't suppose there's ever a quarter or a year where there aren't negatives that partially offset the positives, and there are some negative trend lines as we see it today. So on the other side of the coin, we're experiencing weak refined products demand. We're seeing weakening domestic coal shipments, we're seeing a flattening of steel throughput across our system and as you all know, we're seeing drilling declines in some of the dry gas place. So that's sort of an idea of some of the trends that are affecting all of our companies.
Now let me conclude with the EPB. There, we increased the quarterly distribution per unit to $0.58, that's up 18% over the third quarter of 2011. The distributable cash flow per unit was $0.71 versus $0.55 a year ago. That's up 29%. If you look at it year-to-date, '12 versus '11, it's $2.06 versus $1.89 or up 9%. These solid results really came across EPB's assets, driven by the drop-down that they got in May just before the El Paso-Kinder Morgan merger closed. And it was helped by additional demand for gas for prior generation on both SMG and CIG, as I just detailed a moment ago. So in summary, we think the Kinder Morgan assets are generating a record amounts of cash. We think we're very well-positioned for the future and we expect our footprint to continue to drive sustained growth in the months and years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

And as Rich said, today, the board approved a distribution per unit of $1.26, which is a 9% increase over the third quarter of 2011. That le",3556,"Thanks, Rich. And so starting with KMP on the numbers, the first page of KMP numbers is the GAAP income statement. And as Rich said, today, the board approved a distribution per unit of $1.26, which is a 9% increase over the third quarter of 2011. That leaves us year-to-date at $3.69 declared distribution, which is a 7% increase over the 9 months in 2011. The rest of the GAAP income statement, we don't find overly helpful in understanding our business. But for those of you who do use it, let me point out 2 things: number one, you can see the loss on remeasurement of discontinued operations to fair value. We recognized an additional valuation adjustments in the quarter of $178 million related to the SEC asset. This valuation is based on a signed contract. And so other than small working capital changes, we wouldn't anticipate any significant changes in future quarters. Of the $178 million, KMI is going to reimburse KMP $45 million of that. So real economic impact of that is $133 million, but for GAAP purposes, that contribution by KMI will be shown as the capital contribution and will impact the balance sheet and not the income statement.
The other thing I'll point out on this and we'll go through it, you'll see more of it on the next page is the assets moved from KMI to KMP, and because of their related entities, there are some special accounting rules. And so we have to go back and re-cash KMP's prior financials as if it owned EPB and the 50% of EPNG from May 24, the days they were acquired by KMP. I mean, they were acquired by KMI. And so you'll see on the next page that we will pull out that income because KMP -- KMI got the cash from those operation and KMP did not receive the economic benefits.
Pushing to the next page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow and what we use to -- what we based the dividend that we declare on, the DCF per unit for the quarter is $1.28. That compares to what we're declaring $1.26. So about $6 million of coverage in the quarter. $3.72 year-to-date versus the declared distribution of $3.69. So about $8 million of coverage year-to-date. For the full year, as Rich said, we still expect to distribute $4.98 per unit, and we expect to generate coverage slightly above the distribution. That's a little bit better than what we talked about on the second quarter call, and that's just the result of a little bit better performance coming out of the segments and a little bit lower interest expense.
Now looking at DCF on a total basis, $455 million in the quarter, that's $61 million increase or 15% increase over third quarter 2011, and $1 billion -- $1.28 billion in the 9 months, which is $183 million increase or 17% over the 9 months 2011. Looking at where that $61 million of growth came from and the $183 million for the 9 months, if you look out at the top of the page, this segment -- $1.14 billion in earnings before DD&A, that's up $199 million on the quarter or 21%. And if you look at this segment, about 90% of that growth came from gas and CO2, and a similar story for the 9 months, $456 million of growth in the 9 months, 17%. Again, with about 90% of that coming from the gas and CO2 segment. But looking at the individual segments, products was up $7 million in the quarter. It's down $6 million year-to-date. On the quarter, we had 9 contribution from Cochin, and we had a very favorable volumes there. They were up 40% due to a new contract on an expansion project. We also had a favorable tax adjustment. Transmix, we benefited from pricing and Southeast Terminals, we benefited from acquisitions and higher volumes.
For the year products, we expect to finish slightly below its budget, and we are slightly below their budget year-to-date. And that is Transmix, we had a contract that expired there. Kinder Morgan crude and condensate, the volumes came online a little bit later than what we anticipated. Ultimately, we think the volumes will be there, and it's a timing issue. And then we had lower volumes on SSTP and CALNEV on our West Coast pipeline, given lower demand and also competition from it another pipeline. Those negatives were then partially offset by nice volumes and a shipper settlement on our Cochin Pipeline.
Natural gas for the quarter up $136 million year-to-date, up $239 million. As Rich said, significant benefit from the drops in the quarter. In the quarter, we also benefited from acquisition that we did in the fourth quarter of last year on our treating business, as well as just better base performance there. In the Eagle Ford, we benefited from our JV that commenced shipping volumes in August of last year. We also benefited from a ramp up in volume of our Fayetteville Express Pipeline. And then those positives were somewhat offset by lower results on our pipes in the Rockies as a result of excess pipe capacity there. And also on the Texas Intrastate, where we had an unexpected storage repair variance in some O&M timing. Year-to-date, natural gas is $96 million above its budget. For the full year, we expect it to be significantly exceed its budget. And that is a result of the drops in the net of the loss income from the FTC sale. Absent those 2 transactions, natural gas would be down for the year versus its budget. And that's just a function of the lower value in the dry gas area, primarily on KinderHawk, as well as a slower ramp up in volumes versus what we expected in our budget in the Eagle Ford. CO2 is up $45 million in the quarter. It's up $176 million year-to-date.
In the quarter, oil volumes were up. 1,400 barrels per day on a net basis, that was primarily cap at SACROC. EGL barrels were up 900 barrels per day. Oil prices were up and then that were somewhat -- some of those positives were somewhat offset by NGL pricing down about $25 a barrel. Year-to-date, CO2 is below its budget and we expect them to be modestly below their budget for the full year. About $50 million, which is all a function and actually, more all function more of the NGL prices.
Terminals, up $3 million in the quarter. It's up $37 million year-to-date. The growth in the quarter, about 1/2 of that was internal growth that came from -- on the liquids Terminals, for new contracts, higher rates, expansion projects, higher volume and then export coal volumes. It is parallel to slightly below its budget year-to-date but we expect them to be on budget for the year, primarily as a result of stronger export coal volumes, offsetting reduced domestic coal and weaker steel volume.
Kinder Morgan Canada, up $8 million in the quarter. It's up $10 million year-to-date, and it's up $10 million  versus year-to-date and we expect it to exceed its budget for the year. And that's a function of higher volumes, both on Trans Mountain and express, favorable booked taxes and then favorable incentive management fee that we get paid on express due to the higher volume.
G&A, if you drop down about 6, 4 lines. G&A in the quarter, up $13 million. It's up $23 million year-to-date, and in the quarter, it's almost solely attributable to the TGP acquisition. Year-to-date versus our budget, we are within 1% of our budget if you exclude the TGP acquisition. So TGP G&A accounts for most of the variants year-to-date versus our budget. And we expect to be over our budget for the full year as a result of G&A associated with TGP.
Interest. It's $40 million increase in the quarter, $59 million year-to-date, almost solely attributable to increased balance. We did get a small benefit from lower rates in the year-to-date numbers. Versus our budget, we expect to be negative both -- we are negative year-to-date -- on the -- versus the budget. We expect to be negative versus the budget for the full year as a result of the drop-down. If you take out the impact of the drop-down, our interest expense would be positive for the year versus our budget due to lower rates.
Looking at sustaining CapEx, it's up $23 million in the quarter. It's up $34 million year-to-date. It's actually positive versus our budget year-to-date, but that's timing. For the full year, we expect to be about $58 million above our budget. But that is attributable to the drop downs. Without the drop-down, the remaining business segments in aggregate would be very close to their budget.
Looking at the certain items for the quarter, we talked about the loss on remeasurement of $178 million, that's the biggest piece of the total certain items, which are $191 million. The other 2 large certain items are the 3 acquisition earnings allocated to the general partner. These are the earnings that KMP picked up for GAAP purposes prior to its acquisition date. And then we took the noncash environmental reserve of $34 million.
So that's the attributable cash flow for the quarter. Looking at the balance sheet, you will see that there's a significant change in total assets, about a $9.5 billion increase compared to 12/31 of 2011. And other than recurring items, there are 2 significant events impacting the balance sheet, which are the 2 significant -- in the 2 transactions, the FTC sale and the drop-down. We talked about the FTC sales last quarter, which has the impact of moving assets from long term to current and classifying them as held for sale. And then the drop-down, the impact of this is that we have to record the drop-down at KMI book value. So KMP records them as KMI's book value, even though it paid a different price. And in this case, it paid less in KMI's book value. And so you're going to see a large change in partners capital. You'll see $3.2 billion change in partners capital. A significant portion of that $3.2 billion in partners capital is the difference between the book value that we have to record these assets, which is KMI's book value, and the price that KMP paid. And that's considered a general partner contribution.
Debt-to-EBITDA for the quarter 4x, now that is pro forma for the sale of the FTC assets. We expected the FTC assets will close in November, and that we will use all those proceeds to pay down debt. And so it's just a timing issue. We expect that we should as you can see at the footnote, $1.76 billion. And so if you adjust our debt for that, we're 4x. Without that adjustment, debt-to-EBITDA would be at 4.4x. If you look at debt, we ended the quarter at $7.4 billion, that's a change versus 6/30 of about $4.8 billion. So $4.8 billion increase in debt. As I said, there's about $1.8 billion of additional reduction or happens, so if you netted that off, we will have only $3 billion increase in debt. When reconciling the $4.8 billion netted for you, is -- basically, there are $6.2 billion in acquisition, CapEx and contributions to equity investments. And we raised about $1.4 billion in equity. And just to go through a little bit more detail, the drop value and my $6.2 billion is $5.66 billion. And all that is the $6.22 billion that you've seen in the press less our share of that joint EPNG joint venture debt, which is not on our balance sheet. And so that's the biggest part of the acquisition. Expansion capital is about $388 million. The contributions to equity investments, $70 million.
On the $1.4 billion raised, we raised about $700.7 million from the KMR offering. KMI sit back about $400 million in the drop-down transactions. We raised about $120 million in the ATM under the KMR distributions or about $125 million.
So that's KMP. Now I will move to EPB. Oh, and just on KMP, we expect to end the year debt-to-EBITDA around 3.8x, just slightly better than what I mentioned on the last quarter call, which was 3.9x.
Looking at EPB again, we don't consider the GAAP income statement overly helpful in understanding our business. It does show the declared distribution per unit for the quarter of the $0.58. So on the second page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow, distributable cash flow per unit was $0.71 in the quarter. So compared to the dividend or the distribution of $0.58, that's a little over $25 million of coverage in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have declared dividends of or distributions of $2.06. That compares to -- or, sorry, we generated cash flow of $2.06. We have declared distributions of $1.64. And so that's $87 million of coverage year-to-date.
Looking at the distributable cash flow on a whole number, $149 million in the quarter. That's up $36 million or 32% versus the third quarter of last year. $427 million for the 9 months, which is up $58 million or 16% versus a year ago.
Looking at what drove the growth of $36 million and $58 million for the 9 month, if you look at the segment, earnings before DD&A up $43 million. But as we discussed last quarter, that doesn't tell the whole story because EPB has acquired partial interest in pipelines from El Paso for -- and the way that, that shows up on the income statement is that it reduces your noncontrolling interest expense as they acquired those additional interest. And so you have to look down to the noncontrolling interest. So in the quarter, $43 million in earnings before DD&A. The noncontrolling interest was reduced by about $4 million. So $47 million in growth coming out of the assets. About $25 million of that is associated with acquisitions, primarily plain, and about $22 million of that is associated with the other assets that we owned at both periods, primarily expansions on Southern Natural Gas and increased gas fire power generation demand.
There was about $12 million when you add together G&A, interest, the increased GP incentive and sustaining CapEx offsetting that $47 million. The G&A was lower, primarily due to cost savings, as well as sustaining CapEx was lower due to cost savings. Interest was higher given more debt and the GP interest was an increase, given the higher distribution per unit and more units outstanding. And so you now have the $12 million from the $47 million, that gives you about $35 million in gross on distributable cash flow. For the year, $15 million increase in earnings before DD&A. Again, looking down the page, you see a in noncontrolling interest expense of about $34 million. So about $84 million in growth, little over $60 million that comes from the acquisition and the balance is coming from those assets in both periods, primarily Southern Natural Gas.
Offsetting that is about $30 million of increased expense primarily increased interest expense and increased GP incentive to get you to the $58 million in growth.
For the full year, as we said in the press release, we're still expecting to distribute $2.25, and have over $95 million in coverage.
On EPB's balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter debt-to-EBITDA 4.2x. That's up a little bit from 12/31 of 2011. But it's down from the second quarter, which we reported at 4.7x. It's down for the quarter primarily because we did the equity offering in order to put the long-term financing in place on the drop downs that were done during the second quarter.
Debt is decreased by about $304 million in the quarter, and just to reconcile that for you, we spent about $14 million in expansion CapEx. We issued $278 million in EPB units. We had about $26 million in excess coverage and then there was about $14 million in working capital and other items.
Turning to KMI, as I said last quarter, the first page is our cash available for dividends, which we think is the most important measure for KMI. We tried to divide it into 2 sections: the top section, which we -- is the cash generated from the GP and LP interest in KMP and EPB, which I'll refer to as the GP section; the bottom section, which you can see is entitled El Paso Corporation's Cash Available for Distribution, is the asset section. And those are assets that we ultimately think will be dropped to the MLPs. As I said last quarter, it's not perfect. All the cash taxes they're up in the top section, and all the acquisition interest as well as the EPC interest, some of which will remain after we get all the asset dropped or in the bottom section.
The other thing we've done on the schedule is we pulled out the transaction cost to give you a sense of the recurring cash flow. But we detailed those for you in footnote 11.
Looking at the quarter, we generated $362 million of cash available to pay dividends. That's almost double what we generated in the third quarter of last year that translates into $0.35 per share, that compares to our declared distribution of $0.36 per share. So we have about $12 million of negative coverage. So that is what we expect in the second and the third quarter, given the timing of interest payment and tax payments.
For the 9 months, $972 million, which is $349 million above the 9 months ended in 2011. That's $1.13 per share compared to the declared distribution of $1.03. So a little over $75 million in coverage year-to-date.
For the full year, we expect cash available to be over $1.325 billion, and we still expect to pay at least $1.40. Looking at where the growth came from, the $174 million on the quarter and $349 million year-to-date. On the quarter, the increase from 4 29 -- to 4 29 from 3 54, $78 million increase in KMP's distribution to us. EPB distribution to us, $92 million increase due to the acquisition. So between our 2 interest in the MLPs, $170 million increase. That's offset by about $41 million increase in interest, taxes and G&A, the largest piece of that $41 million is $33 million increase in taxes, which is associated with the higher income.
The cash available from the EPC assets, $48 million. And then we had a $3 million decrease in NGPL Cash Available for Distribution. That takes you to $1.74. For the 9 months, $171 million increase in KMP's distribution to us, $174 million comes from the general partner and limited partner interest in EPB. So $345 million year-to-date coming from the 2 interests in MLP.
So the an increase in interest and taxes and G&A at $66 million. Again, the biggest piece of that is over $50 million increase in taxes due to the higher income. $86 million coming from the EPC assets and then NGPL is down about $16 million take you to $349 million in gross year-to-date.
On KMI's balance sheet, looking down at the debt on KMI, we ended the quarter at $11.2 billion. Now that's a lot from $3.2 billion at the end of last year. But it's down from the $16.4 billion where we ended the second quarter. And so just very, very roughly and broadly, we started the year at $3 billion. We took on roughly $13 billion in the El Paso transaction between transaction itself and some of the transaction related expenses. We paid down $5 billion in this quarter, and that leaves us $11 billion. So when you look at the $5 billion pay down in the quarter, that's actually $5.2 billion that we paid down. We got $5.275 billion of debt reductions coming from the drop-down. And that's $3.5 billion in cash that KMI got from those -- from KMP from those drop-down, and then $1.8 billion in debt moved from KMI to KMP. It was done on DCP that was assumed by KMP in the transaction. We had about $146 million in transaction related expenses. The biggest piece of that was related to the El Paso merger litigation that we've now resolved. And then we also had $137 million in transaction related tax benefits, primarily tax benefits related to the deferred comp that got paid at the closing of the transaction. So when you net those 2 [ph] $9 million of cash outflow associated with that transaction.
We repurchased $26 million in warrants. As you know, we include KMR in the cash available for dividends as the assets for cash. We did not shared sell those shares in the quarter so we have not get converted those cash. And then we've made a little over $40 million in contribution to the 2 MLPs to maintain that 2% interest. And also, in JB contributions to the JVs that are still held at KMI and expansion capital. And then we had $10 million in working capital and other items. And so that gets you to the $5.2 -- around $5 billion reduction in debt. So that's it."

The first is on the ramp in crude oil and condensate volumes that were detailed in your prepared commentary, how do you think about leveraging the $200 million investment in that condensate processing facility? Because you got ample storage capacity at Galena Park and obviously, it looks like volumes of crude and condensate from Eagle Ford are going to be moving from a lot of those new pipes that you detailed. So it's visits up of project wicked the comp or vertically integrated to the extent that capacity even exceeds that 100,000 barrels per day upsides that you got warranted?"

But I think the most likely thing is we do have this whole collection of assets and already, as you can see, as we detailed in this, our Terminals group is has a contract also with BP to provide pretty significant storage, which BP is using as part of the operation of the condensate processor. So I think that's one way. Obviously, we believe we will upsize that condensate processing Unit and we're looking for other ways to maximize the utilization. Now of course, as we pointed out last quarter, another very strange hook-up to this whole thing is the reversal of Cochin, which is actually, in the end, going to be used to move -- process out of the condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford and move all the way back up into Alberta. So there's a lot of things here, we're continuing to explore. And I think we have a tremendous position, a great footprint here, and we're going to use it to the extent we can."

Everybody around here is waiting for that. But I can't give you some color on how things are going. Clearly, on TGP, obviously, the ability to access production from the Marcellus and the Utica is a tremendous plus. We're seeing all kinds of opportunities for our expansions. Some of which we detailed in the earnings release and some of which are not quite to that stage yet to be released. But we're seeing very good demand on the Eastern part or downstream part of that system. So we're very pleased with it. And it is performing a bit better than we expected. On EPNG, the drop-down is drop there is actually now 50% and KMP still at 50%. Drop-down KMI will drop 50%, sometime next year. On that, again, we've made no secret of the fact that the great upside there is not to the California demand but the ability to drop off volumes along the way, particularly into Mexico. When we talked about the project, which is a $200 million plus project, which we'll begin to additional volumes that will be picked up on the brand you pipeline being built by other parties done in Mexico. We would hook-up of the border near -- Arizona. Just a lot of potential to drop more volumes off. And when you do that, we believe we will end up with more than one lateral going down there. And when that happens, you have 2 things: You earn on the money you've spent on those laterals plus you're building some the capacity that is now not being utilized to ship gas to California to California. The other thing is that we continue to look at the potential to use portions of that system to convert it to other uses, perhaps moving crude oil less from the Permian Basin. That's very speculative at this point, but there are lots of opportunities. It could be very exciting there. So we're very pleased with the way both of these are performing so far, and look forward to a lot of upside opportunities in 2013 and beyond."

And still convert aligned all the way from the Permian to Southern California. The volumes could be very substantial, maybe 300,000 or 400,000 barrels a day, and the effort to or the opportunity to collect capital could be up to around $2 billion of that project. But again come I want to emphasize, this is very early stages of our thoughts that we have had some interesting conversations with potential shippers on that line who are very enthusiastic. What we're seeing is, there's continued increase in production in the Permian, particularly as these different sands are being exploited there. And there's a lot of effort on a lot of people's parts to move this over at Houston and we're certain to look at some opportunities there too. But we think there's also, given the dichotomy of prices between California and Texas, there is certainly some real interest at the right price under the right conditions to move an oil to the West. And we're certainly going to look at that as a possibility. Again, it's still speculative at this point but it's kind of interesting to think about."

And welcome to the Kinder Morgan third quarter analyst call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc.",1609,"Okay. Thank you, Craig. And welcome to the Kinder Morgan third quarter analyst call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll refer to as KMI; Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which I'll refer to as KMP; and El Paso Pipeline Partners, which I'll refer to as EPB. Together, these 3 companies make up the Kinder Morgan family of companies. We own and operate pipelines and terminals. We are the largest midstream energy company in North America and the third largest energy company of any kind in North America with an enterprise -- combined enterprise value of about $100 billion.
I'll give an overview of the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer, who will go through the detailed financials; and then, we'll throw it open for questions, and we've got our senior management team here, ready to answer any questions you may have.
I'm going to try to be briefer than normal, so we have more time for question and answer. I know, particularly in the East, it gets a little late when these calls gets going.
Post the El Paso merger, we've noticed in each call, we have additional participants on the line. So I think it's important that I sort of remind you of the philosophy of Kinder Morgan and the way we operate. We own and operate assets, about 75,000 miles of pipelines and 180-plus terminals around North America. These assets produce large amounts of cash flow, and our primary goal is to grow that cash flow and distribute it to our unitholders at KMP and EPB and to our shareholders at KMI. At our 2 MLPs, we view the key measurement as being distributable cash flow per unit. And at KMI, it's cash available per dividends per share.
Post the El Paso acquisition, we said that between 2011, using that as the base year, and 2015, we could grow dividends per share at KMI by about 12.5% per year. We could grow distributions per unit at KMP and its sister security, KMR, by about 7% a year, and we could grow distributions at EPB by about 9% a year. And we still expect to achieve those goals.
Consistent with our philosophy and goals, all 3 of our entities raised their distributions, and all 3 improved the cash available per share or unit by measurable amounts during this past quarter.
Let me start with KMI. We raised the dividend to $0.36 per share. That's up 20% from the dividend rate a year ago and represents $1.44 on an annualized basis. Our cash available for dividends increased by 93% from the third quarter of '11 and year-to-date, it increased to $972 million from $623 million during the first 9 months of '11. That's an increase of 56%.
We expect to generate cash available for dividends well in excess of $1.325 billion for the full year 2012 and declare dividends -- and to declare dividends of at least $1.40. $1.40 would be an increase of 17% from the $1.20 that we declared in 2011.
On a per share basis, which, as I said, is the most relevant measure, the cash available increased from the third quarter a year ago by 30%. It went from $0.27 to $0.35. And if you looked at the 3 quarters in the year-to-date, the increase was 28% from $0.88 in 2011 to $1.13 in 2012 for the first 3 quarters. Driving this performance, KMI benefited from strong performance by KMP and EPB and from the assets acquired from El Paso that are still housed at KMI prior to being dropped down to KMP and EPB. We continue to be pleased with the El Paso assets and their integration in the Kinder Morgan family. And we're on our way to achieving annual cost savings of more than $400 million compared to our original estimate of $350 million.
Now there are some other significant developments at KMI during the quarter. First, in August, KMI completed the drop-down of 100% interest in Tennessee Gas Pipeline and the 50% interest in El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to KMP for $6.22 billion, including assumed debt. Secondly, we expect the FTC mandated sale of certain of KMP's Rocky Mountain assets, which we had to sell to close the merger with El Paso. We expect that divestiture to be closed during November of this year. And third, just last week, on October 11, Goldman Sachs, The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings sold the remaining portion of their KMI stock. As you probably know, neither KMI nor any of KMI management sold any shares, and that leaves now only Highstar from the original investor group, and they have about 8% of the shares outstanding at KMI.
At KMP, we increased the quarterly distribution to $1.26 per unit, that's $504 annualized, that's up 9% over the third quarter a year ago. And again, coming back to the most important measure of the distributable cash flow per unit before certain items, at KMP, it was $1.28 versus $1.19 last year, or an increase of 8%.
Year-to-date numbers on the same per unit basis were $3.72 versus $3.40 a year ago and that's an increase of 9%. Driving that growth, all 5 of our business segments at KMP reported better results than in the third quarter of '11. The main drivers included the following: First, at the gas group, obviously, the contributions from the drop-down of TGP and EPNG, which were accomplished in early August of this quarter; second, at the Terminals group, a record export coal volumes again this quarter; and third, in our CO2 segment, strong oil production at SACROC and very good NGL production during the quarter.
Now if you look across KMP and include the other KM companies, we now have over $11 billion of expansion projects in the works. These are projects that have customer commitments or were very close to having customer commitments on them, and they're in various stages of preparation and construction. The great bulk of that $11-plus billion is at KMP. We talked last quarter about having approximately $10 billion. That number has now escalated by well over $1 billion. We made progress on virtually all of these projects in the third quarter, and that progress is outlined with some detail in our release and in the interest of time, I won't go into it right now.
In addition, we continue to pursue additional opportunities, which appeared to be numerous and growing. If you look at general trends that impacted all of the Kinder Morgan companies, on the positive side, we had a strong increase in natural gas used in electric generation.
Let me give you some numbers that I find a little bit astounding. On our Tennessee system, for the quarter, throughput utilized for natural gas demand -- natural gas power demand was up 8% for the quarter and 20% year-to-date. On our Southern Natural Gas system, the sonar [ph] system in the southeastern United States, we're up 26% for the quarter and 47% year-to-date. On the Colorado Interstate system, we were up 13% for the quarter and 44% year-to-date. So really strong growth in the utilization of our pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to be used for electric generation purposes.
A second positive trend that we've seen is a strong and growing market for CO2 to be used in tertiary recovery, particularly in the Permian Basin. We've mentioned that for several quarters now. And as we've detailed, we have a number of projects to hopefully capture additional portions of that demand.
Third positive trend line has been export coal. That remains strong at our Terminals in both on the East Coast and along the Gulf Coast.
And a fourth positive is that, as we all know, there's lots of drilling in the wet gas shale plays, and that additional drilling and production is leading to increased demand for the kind of infrastructure that we have in our footprint.
Now I don't suppose there's ever a quarter or a year where there aren't negatives that partially offset the positives, and there are some negative trend lines as we see it today. So on the other side of the coin, we're experiencing weak refined products demand. We're seeing weakening domestic coal shipments. We're seeing a flattening of steel throughput across our system. And as you all know, we're seeing drilling declines in some of the dry gas place. So that's sort of an idea of some of the trends that are affecting all of our companies.
Now let me conclude with the EPB. There, we increased the quarterly distribution per unit to $0.58, that's up 18% over the third quarter of 2011. The distributable cash flow per unit was $0.71 versus $0.55 a year ago, that's up 29%. If you look at it year-to-date, '12 versus '11, it's $2.06 versus $1.89, or up 9%. These solid results really came across EPB's assets, driven by the drop-down that they got in May just before the El Paso-Kinder Morgan merger closed. And it was helped by additional demand for gas for power generation on both SNG and CIG, as I just detailed a moment ago.
So in summary, we think the Kinder Morgan assets are generating record amounts of cash. We think we're very well positioned for the future, and we expect our footprint to continue to drive sustained growth in the months and years to come.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,222899263,366025,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rich. And so starting with KMP, on the numbers, the first page of KMP numbers is the GAAP income statement. And as Rich said, today, the Board approved a distribution per unit of $1.26, which is a 9% increase over the third quarter of 2011. That l",3576,"Thanks, Rich. And so starting with KMP, on the numbers, the first page of KMP numbers is the GAAP income statement. And as Rich said, today, the Board approved a distribution per unit of $1.26, which is a 9% increase over the third quarter of 2011. That leaves us year-to-date at $3.69 declared distributions, which is a 7% increase over the 9 months in 2011. The rest of the GAAP income statement, we don't find overly helpful in understanding our business. But for those of you who do use it, let me point out 2 things: Number one, you can see the loss on remeasurement of discontinued operations to fair value. We recognized an additional valuation adjustments in the quarter of $178 million related to the SEC asset. This valuation is based on a signed contract. And so other than small working capital changes, we wouldn't anticipate any significant changes in the future quarters. Of the $178 million, KMI is going to reimburse KMP $45 million of that. So the real economic impact of that is $133 million. But for GAAP purposes, that contribution by KMI will be shown as the capital contribution and will impact the balance sheet and not the income statement.
The other thing I'll point out on this and we'll go through it, you'll see it more on the next page, is that because assets moved from KMI to KMP and because of their related entities, there are some special accounting rules. And so we have to go back and recap KMP's prior financials as if it owned EPB and the 50% of EPNG from May 24, the date they were acquired by KMP -- I mean, they were acquired by KMI. And so you'll see on the next page that we will pull out that income because KMP -- KMI got the cash from those operation, and KMP did not receive the economic benefits.
Pushing to the next page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow and what we use to -- what we base the dividend that we declare on, the DCF per unit for the quarter is $1.28. That compares to what we're declaring, $1.26. So about $6 million of coverage in the quarter. $3.72 year-to-date versus declared distribution of $3.69. So about $8 million of coverage year-to-date. For the full year, as Rich said, we still expect to distribute $4.98 per unit, and we expect to generate coverage slightly above the distribution. That's a little bit better than what we talked about on the second quarter call, and that's just the result of a little bit better performance coming out of the segments and a little bit lower interest expense.
Now looking at DCF, on a total basis, $455 million in the quarter, that's $61 million increase or 15% increase over third quarter 2011, and $1 billion -- $1.28 billion in the 9 months, which is an $80 -- $183 million increase or 17% over the 9 months 2011. Looking at where that $61 million of growth came from and the $183 million for the 9 months, if you look out at the top of the page, this segment -- $1.14 billion in earnings before DD&A, that's up $199 million on the quarter or 21%. And if you look at this segment, about 90% of that growth came from gas and CO2, and a similar story for the 9 months, $456 million of growth in the 9 months, 17%. Again, with about 90% of that coming from gas and CO2 segment. So looking at the individual segments, products was up $7 million in the quarter. It's down $6 million year-to-date. On the quarter, we had 9 contributions from Cochin, and we had a very favorable volumes there. They were up 40% due to a new contract on an expansion project. We also had a favorable tax adjustment. Transmix, we benefited from pricing. And Southeast Terminals, we benefited from acquisitions and higher volumes.
For the year, products, we expect to finish slightly below its budget, and they are slightly below their budget year-to-date. And that is Transmix, we had a contract that expired there. Kinder Morgan crude and condensate, the volumes came online a little bit later than what we anticipated. Ultimately, we think the volumes will be there, and it's just a timing issue. And then we've had lower volumes on SSTP and CALNEV, our West Coast pipeline, given lower demand and also competition from another pipeline. Those negatives have been then partially offset by nice volumes and a shipper settlement on our Cochin platform.
Natural gas for the quarter up $136 million year-to-date, up $239 million. As Rich said, significant benefit from the drops in the quarter. In the quarter, we also benefited from acquisition that we did in the fourth quarter of last year on our treating business, as well as just better base performance there. In the Eagle Ford, we benefited from our JV that commenced shipping volumes in August of last year. We also benefited from a ramp-up in volumes of our Fayetteville Express Pipeline. And then those positives were somewhat offset by lower results on our pipes in the Rockies as a result of excess pipe capacity there. And also, on the Texas Intrastate, where we had an unexpected storage repair and some O&M timing. Year-to-date, natural gas is $96 million above its budget. For the full year, we expect it to be significantly exceeding its budget. And that is the result of the drops in the net of the loss income from the FTC sale. Absent those 2 transactions, natural gas would be down for the year versus its budget. And that's just a function of the lower volumes in the dry gas area, primarily on KinderHawk, as well as a slower ramp-up in volumes versus what we expected in our budget in the Eagle Ford. CO2 is up $45 million in the quarter. It's up $176 million year-to-date.
In the quarter, oil volumes were up, 1,400 barrels a day on a net basis, that was primarily capped at SACROC. EGL barrels were up 900 barrels per day. Oil prices were up, and then that was somewhat -- those positives were somewhat offset by NGL pricing down about $25 a barrel. Year-to-date, CO2 is below its budget and we expect them to be modestly below their budget for the full year. About $50 million, which is all a function and actually, more -- all function of more of the NGL prices.
Terminals, up $3 million in the quarter. It's up $37 million year-to-date. The growth in the quarter, about 1/2 of that was internal growth that came from -- on the liquids Terminals, for new contracts at higher rates, expansion projects, higher volume and then a -- and then export coal volumes. It is comparable -- it's slightly below their budget year-to-date, but we expect them to be on budget for the year, primarily as a result of stronger export coal volumes, offsetting reduced domestic coal and weaker steel volume.
Kinder Morgan Canada, up $8 million in the quarter. It's up $10 million year-to-date, and it's up $10 million versus the budget year-to-date, and we expect it to exceed its budget for the year. And that's a function of higher volumes, both on Trans Mountain and Express, favorable booked taxes and then favorable incentive management fee that we get paid on Express due to the higher volume.
G&A, if you drop down about 6, 4 lines, G&A in the quarter, up $13 million. It's up $23 million year-to-date, and in the quarter, it's almost solely attributable to the TGP acquisition. Year-to-date versus our budget, we are within 1% of our budget if you exclude the TGP acquisition. So TGP G&A accounts for most of the variants year-to-date versus our budget. And we expect to be over our budget for the full year as a result of G&A associated with TGP.
The interest -- it's $40 million increase in the quarter, $59 million year-to-date, almost solely attributable to increased balance. We did get a small benefit from lower rates in the year-to-date numbers. Versus our budget, we expect to be negative both -- we are negative year-to-date -- on the -- versus the budget. We expect to be negative versus the budget for the full year as a result of the drop-down. If you take out the impact of the drop-down, our interest expense would be positive for the year versus our budget due to lower rate.
Looking at sustaining CapEx, it's up $23 million in the quarter. It's up $34 million year-to-date. It's actually positive versus our budget year-to-date. But that's timing. So the full year, we expect to be about $58 million above our budget. But that is attributable to the drop-downs. Without the drop-down, the remaining business segments in aggregate would be very close to their budget.
Looking at the certain items for the quarter, we talked about the loss on remeasurement of $178 million, that's the biggest piece of the total certain items, which are $191 million. The other 2 large certain items are the 3 acquisition earnings allocated to the general partner. These are the earnings that KMP picked up for GAAP purposes prior to its acquisition date, and then we took a non-cash environmental reserve of $34 million. So that's the distributable cash flow for the quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet, you will see that there's a significant change in total assets, about a $9.5 billion increase compared to 12/31/2011. And other than recurring items, there are 2 significant events impacting the balance sheet, which are the 2 significant -- the 2 transactions, the FTC sale and the drop-down. We talked about the FTC sales last quarter, which has the impact of moving assets from long term to current and classifying them as held for sale. And then the drop-down, the impact of this is that we have to record the drop-downs at KMI's book value. So KMP records them at KMI's book value even though it paid a different price. And in this case, it paid less in KMI's book value. And so you're going to see a large change in partners' capital. You'll see a $3.2 billion change in partners' capital. A significant portion of that $3.2 billion in partners' capital is the difference between the book value that we have to record these assets, which is KMI's book value; and the price that KMP paid. And that's considered a general partner contribution.
Debt-to-EBITDA for the quarter, 4x. Now that is pro forma for the sale of the FTC assets. The -- we expected that the FTC assets will close in November, and that we will use all those proceeds to pay down debt. And so it's just a timing issue. We expect that we should let, as you can see on the footnote, $1.76 billion. And so if you adjust our debt for that, we're 4x. Without that adjustment, debt-to-EBITDA would be at 4.4x.
If you look at debt, we ended the quarter at $7.4 billion, that's a change versus 6/30 of about $4.8 billion, so $4.8 billion increase in debt. As I said, there's about $1.8 billion of additional reduction that will happen. So if you netted that off, we would have only a $3 billion increase in debt. When reconciling the $4.8 billion for you is -- basically, there are $6.2 billion in acquisition, CapEx and contributions to equity investments. And we raised about $1.4 billion in equity. And just to go through a little bit more detail, the drop value and my $6.2 billion is $5.66 billion. And all that is the $6.22 billion that you've seen in the press, less our share of that joint -- EPNG joint venture debt, which is not on our balance sheet. And so that's the biggest part of the acquisition. Expansion capital is about $388 million. The contributions to equity investment is $70 million.
On the $1.4 billion raised, we raised about $700.7 million from the KMR offering. KMI sit back about $400 million in the drop-down transactions. We raised about $120 million in the ATM under the KMR distributions or about $125 million. So that's KMP.
Now I will move to EPB -- oh, and just on KMP, we expect to end the year debt-to-EBITDA around 3.8x, just slightly better than what I mentioned on the last quarter call, which was 3.9x.
Looking at EPB, again, we don't consider the GAAP income statement overly helpful in understanding our business. It does show the declared distribution per unit for the quarter of the $0.58. So on the second page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow, distributable cash flow per unit was $0.71 in the quarter. So compared to the dividend or the distribution of $0.58, that's a little over $25 million of coverage in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have declared dividends of $2 -- or distributions of $2.06. That compares to -- or, sorry, we generated cash flow of $2.06. We have declared distributions of $1.64. And so, that's $87 million of coverage year-to-date.
Looking at the distributable cash flow on a whole number, $149 million in the quarter. That's up $36 million or 32% versus the third quarter of last year. $427 million for the 9 months, which is up $58 million or 16% versus a year ago.
Looking at what drove the growth of $36 million and $58 million for the 9 months, if you look out at the segment, earnings before DD&A, up $43 million. But as we discussed last quarter, that doesn't tell the whole story because EPB has acquired partial interest in pipelines from El Paso for -- and the way that, that shows up on the income statement is that it reduces your non-controlling interest expenses they acquired as additional interest. And so you have to look down to the non-controlling interest. So in the quarter, $43 million in earnings before DD&A. The non-controlling interest was reduced by about $4 million. So $47 million in growth coming out of the assets. About $25 million of that is associated with acquisitions, primarily Cheyenne Plain, and about $22 million of that is associated with the other assets that we owned at both periods, primarily expansions on Southern Natural Gas and increased gas firepower generation demand.
There was about $12 million when you add together G&A, interest, the GP -- the increased GP incentive and sustaining CapEx offsetting that $47 million. The G&A was lower, primarily due to cost savings, as well as sustaining CapEx was lower due to cost savings. Interest was higher given more debt and the GP interest was an increase given the higher distribution per unit and more units outstanding. And so you now have the $12 million from the $47 million, that gives you about $35 million in growth on distributable cash flow.
For the year, $50 million increase in earnings before DD&A. Again, looking down the page, you see a decrease in non-controlling interest expense of about $34 million. So about $84 million in growth, a little over $60 million that comes from the acquisition, and the balance is coming from  assets on the both periods, primarily Southern Natural Gas. Offsetting that is about $30 million of increased expense, primarily increased interest expense and increased GP incentive to get you to the $58 million in growth.
For the full year, as we said in the press release, we're still expecting to distribute $2.25 and have over $95 million in coverage.
On EPB's balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter debt-to-EBITDA 4.2x. That's up a little bit from 12/31 of 2011. But it's down from the second quarter, which we reported at 4.7x. It's down for the quarter primarily because we did the equity offering in order to put the long-term financing in place on the drop-downs that were done during the second quarter.
Debt is decreased by about $304 million in the quarter. And just to reconcile that for you, we spent about $14 million in expansion CapEx. We issued $278 million in EPB units. We had about $26 million in excess coverage. And then there was about $14 million in working capital and other items.
Turning to KMI, as I said last quarter, the first page is our cash available for dividends, which we think is the most important measure for KMI. We tried to divide it into 2 sections: the top section, which we -- is the cash generated from the GP and LP interest in KMP and EPB, which I'll refer to as the GP section; the bottom section, which you can see is entitled El Paso Corporation's Cash Available for Distribution, is the asset section. And those are assets that we ultimately think will be dropped to the MLPs. As I said last quarter, it's not perfect. All the cash taxes, they're up in the top section. And all the acquisition interest as well as the EPC interest, some of which will remain after we get all the assets dropped or in the bottom section.
The other thing we've done on the schedule is we pulled out the transaction cost to give you a sense of the recurring cash flow. But we detailed those for you in Footnote 11.
Looking at the quarter, we generated $362 million of cash available to pay dividends. That's almost double what we generated in the third quarter of last year. That translates into $0.35 per share. That compares to our declared distribution of $0.36 per share. So we have about $12 million of negative coverage. So that is what we expect in the second and the third quarter, given the timing of interest payments and tax payments.
For the 9 months, $972 million, which is $349 million above the 9 months ended in 2011, that's $1.13 per share compared to the declared distribution of $1.03. So a little over $75 million in coverage year-to-date.
For the full year, we expect cash available to be over $1.325 billion, and we still expect to pay at least $1.40. Looking at where the growth came from, the $174 million on the quarter and $349 million year-to-date, on the quarter, the increase from $429 million -- to $429 million from $354 million, $78 million increase in KMP's distribution to us. EPB distribution to us, $92 million increase due to the acquisition. So between our 2 interests in the MLPs, $170 million increase. That's offset by about $41 million increase in interest, taxes and G&A. The largest piece of that $41 million is $33 million  increase in taxes, which is associated with the higher income, the cash available from the EPC assets, $48 million. And then we had a $3 million decrease in NGPL cash available for distribution. That takes you to the $1.74. 
For the 9 months, $171 million increase in KMP's distribution to us, $174 million comes from the general partner and limited partner interests in EPC. So $345 million year-to-date coming from the 2 interests in MLP.
There's an increase in interest and taxes and G&A of $66 million. Again, the biggest piece of that is over $50 million increase in taxes due to the higher income; $86 million coming from the EPC assets; and then NGPL is down about $16 million take you to $349 million in gross year-to-date.
On KMR's balance sheet, looking down at the debt on KMI, we ended the quarter at $11.2 billion. Now that's up from $3.2 billion at the end of last year, but it's down from the $16.4 billion where we ended the second quarter. And so just very, very roughly and broadly, we started the year at $3 billion. We took on roughly $13 billion in the El Paso transaction between transaction itself and some of the transaction-related expenses. We paid down $5 billion in this quarter, and that leaves us at $11 billion. So when you look at the $5 billion pay-down in the quarter, it's actually $5.2 billion that we paid down. We got $5.275 billion of debt reductions coming from the drop-down. And that's $3.5 billion in cash that KMI got from those -- from KMP for those drop-downs, and then $1.8 billion in debt moved from KMI to KMP. It was debt on PCP [ph] that was assumed by KMP in the transaction. We had about $146 million in transaction-related expenses. The biggest piece of that was related to the El Paso merger litigation that we've now resolved. And then we also had $137 million in transaction-related tax benefits, primarily tax benefits related to the deferred comp that got paid at the closing of the transaction. So when you net those 2, it's $9 million of cash outflows associated with the transaction.
We repurchased $26 million in warrants. As you know, we include KMR in the cash available for dividends as this is assets that was cash. We did not sell those shares in the quarter, so we've not yet converted that to cash. And then we made a little over $40 million in contribution to the 2 MLPs to maintain the 2% interest, and also in JV contributions to the JVs that are still held at KMI and expansion capital. And then we had $10 million in working capital and other items. And so that gets you to the $5.2 or, rounded, $5 billion reduction in debt. So that's it."

The first is on the ramp in crude oil and condensate volumes that were detailed in your prepared commentary. How do you think about leveraging the $200 million investment in that condensate processing facility because you've got ample storage capacity at Galena Park, and, obviously, it looks like volumes of crude and condensate from the Eagle Ford are going to be moving through a lot of those new pipes that you've detailed. So is this the type of project where you could become more vertically integrated to the extent that capacity even exceeds that 100,000 barrel-a-day upside that you guys want?"

Now of course, as we've pointed out last quarter, another very strange hook-up to this whole thing is the reversal of Cochin, which is actually, in the end, we believe, going to be used to move really oil [ph] processed out of the condensate coming out of Eagle Ford and moved all the way back up into Alberta. So there's a lot of things here we're continuing to explore, but I think we have a tremendous position, a great footprint here, and we're going to use it to every extent we can."

But maybe -- but I can give you some color on how things are going. Clearly, on TGP, obviously, the ability to access production from the Marcellus and the Utica is a tremendous plus. We're seeing all kinds of opportunities for expansions, some of which we detailed in the earnings release and some of which are not quite to that stage yet to be released. But we're seeing very good demand on the Eastern part or downstream part of that system. So we're very pleased with it. And it is performing a bit better than we expected. On EPNG, the drop there is actually now 50%; at KMP, still 50%. And KMI will another drop 50%, I'm sure, sometime next year. On that, again, we've made no secret of the fact that the great upside there is not due to California demand but the ability to drop off volumes along the way, particularly into Mexico. And we talk about the Sasabi [ph] project, which -- a $200 million-plus project, which will hook into additional volumes that would be picked up on the brand-new pipeline being built by other parties down in Mexico. We will hook at -- hook up at the border near Sasabi [ph] in Arizona. So just a lot of potential to drop more volumes off. And when you do that, we believe we will end up with more than one lateral going down there. And when that happens, you have 2 things: You earn on the money you've spent on those laterals, plus you're building some of the capacity that is now not being utilized to ship gas to California. The other thing is that we continue to look at the potential to use portions of that system to convert it to other uses, perhaps moving crude oil west from the Permian Basin. That's very speculative at this point, but there are a lot of opportunities. It could be very exciting there. So we're very pleased with the way both of these are performing so far and look forward to a lot of upside opportunities in 2013 and beyond."

We think there's a good chance we can do something there that again would have maybe one train on an FTA, and then we've had to wait to get larger to see whether we get approval from DOE on a non-FTA. Our whole process, and this is very conservative, I think, we don't want to spend a lot of money cranking up based on getting non-FTA approval. So we're working very hard to secure commitments that are binding even without non-FTA approval. And so the whole projects would be constructed that way.

The NEB just recently ruled in our favor that they would proceed on that basis and set the first -- the hearing on that issue. Now this is not the environmental permitting or routing issues. These are just approving the toll structure so that we know -- we and our customers know that our contractual arrangements for 20 years have been blessed by the regulator. That's going to start in February, and we believe that will be brought to conclusion, hopefully with approval for the process as we've structured it, by some time -- about this time next year. Then we are working with all of the applicable constituencies here, from First Nations to people who are along the pipeline right of away to users, to consult with them on moving forward toward the filing that we will make in late '13 for the environmental and routing permits to actually get the permit to construct the line. And that will be a, we know, a long process. We are going to try to do as much as we can to satisfy people's concerns before the hearing opens. We're not naive. We know that there will still be opposition and that the NEB will have to balance the interest of a lot of different players here.

And welcome to the Kinder Morgan third quarter analyst call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
We'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll refer to as KMI; Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which I'll refer to as KMP; and El Paso Pipeline Partners, which I'll refer to as EPB. Together, these 3 companies make up the Kinder Morgan family of companies. We own and operate pipelines and terminals. We are the largest midstream energy company in North America and the third largest energy company of any kind in North America with an enterprise -- combined enterprise value of about $100 billion.
I'll give an overview of the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer, who will go through the detailed financials; and then, we'll throw it open for questions, and we've got our senior management team here, ready to answer any questions you may have.
I'm going to try to be briefer than normal, so we have more time for question and answer. I know, particularly in the East, it gets a little late when these calls gets going.
Post the El Paso merger, we've noticed in each call, we have additional participants on the line. So I think it's important that I sort of remind you of the philosophy of Kinder Morgan and the way we operate. We own and operate assets, about 75,000 miles of pipelines and 180-plus terminals around North America. These assets produce large amounts of cash flow, and our primary goal is to grow that cash flow and distribute it to our unitholders at KMP and EPB and to our shareholders at KMI. At our 2 MLPs, we view the key measurement as being distributable cash flow per unit. And at KMI, it's cash available per dividends per share.
Post the El Paso acquisition, we said that between 2011, using that as the base year, and 2015, we could grow dividends per share at KMI by about 12.5% per year, that we could grow distributions per unit at KMP and its sister security, KMR, by about 7% a year, and we could grow distributions at EPB by about 9% a year. And we still expect to achieve those goals.
Consistent with our philosophy and goals, all 3 of our entities raised their distributions, and all 3 improved the cash available per share or unit by measurable amounts during this past quarter.
Let me start with KMI. We raised the dividend to $0.36 per share. That's up 20% from the dividend rate a year ago and represents $1.44 on an annualized basis. Our cash available for dividends increased by 93% from the third quarter of '11 and year-to-date, it increased to $972 million from $623 million during the first 9 months of '11. That's an increase of 56%.
We expect to generate cash available for dividends well in excess of $1.325 billion for the full year 2012 and declare dividends -- and to declare dividends of at least $1.40. $1.40 would be an increase of 17% from the $1.20 that we declared in 2011.
On a per share basis, which, as I said, is the most relevant measure, the cash available increased from the third quarter a year ago by 30%. It went from $0.27 to $0.35. And if you looked at the 3 quarters in the year-to-date, the increase was 28% from $0.88 in 2011 to $1.13 in 2012 for the first 3 quarters. Driving this performance, KMI benefited from strong performance by KMP and EPB and from the assets acquired from El Paso that are still housed at KMI prior to being dropped down to KMP and EPB. We continue to be pleased with the El Paso assets and their integration in the Kinder Morgan family and we're on our way to achieving annual cost savings of more than $400 million compared to our original estimate of $350 million.
Now there are some other significant developments at KMI during the quarter. First, in August, KMI completed the drop-down of 100% interest in Tennessee Gas Pipeline and the 50% interest in El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to KMP for $6.22 billion, including assumed debt. Secondly, we expect the FTC mandated sale of certain of KMP's Rocky Mountain assets, which we had to sell to close the merger with El Paso, we expect that divestiture to be closed during November of this year. And third, just last week, on October 11, Goldman Sachs, The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings sold the remaining portion of their KMI stock. As you probably know, neither KMI nor any of the KMI management sold any shares, and that leaves now only Highstar from the original investor group, and they have about 8% of the shares outstanding at KMI.
At KMP, we increased the quarterly distribution to $1.26 per unit, that's $5.04 annualized, that's up 9% over the third quarter a year ago. And again, coming back to the most important measure of the distributable cash flow per unit before certain items, at KMP, it was $1.28 versus $1.19 last year, or an increase of 8%.
Year-to-date numbers on the same per unit basis were $3.72 versus $3.40 a year ago and that's an increase of 9%. Driving that growth, all 5 of our business segments at KMP reported better results than in the third quarter of '11. The main drivers included the following: First, at the gas group, obviously, the contributions from the drop-down of TGP and EPNG, which were accomplished in early August of this quarter; second, at the Terminals group, a record export coal volumes again this quarter; and third, in our CO2 segment, strong oil production at SACROC and very good NGL production during the quarter.
Now if you look across KMP and include the other KM companies, we now have over $11 billion of expansion projects in the works. These are projects that have customer commitments or were very close to having customer commitments on them, and they're in various stages of preparation and construction. The great bulk of that $11-plus billion is at KMP. We talked last quarter about having approximately $10 billion. That number has now escalated by well over $1 billion. We made progress on virtually all of these projects in the third quarter, and that progress is outlined with some detail in our release and in the interest of time, I won't go into it right now.
In addition, we continue to pursue additional opportunities, which appeared to be numerous and growing. If you look at general trends that impacted all of the Kinder Morgan companies, on the positive side, we had a strong increase in natural gas used in electric generation.
Let me give you some numbers that I find a little bit astounding. On our Tennessee system, for the quarter, throughput utilized for natural gas demand -- natural gas power demand was up 8% for the quarter and 20% year-to-date. On our Southern Natural Gas system, the SONA system, in the southeastern United States, we're up 26% for the quarter and 47% year-to-date. On the Colorado Interstate system, we were up 13% for the quarter and 44% year-to-date. So really strong growth in the utilization of our pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to be used for electric generation purposes.
A second positive trend that we've seen is a strong and growing market for CO2 to be used in tertiary recovery, particularly in the Permian Basin. We've mentioned that for several quarters now and as we've detailed, we have a number of projects to hopefully capture additional portions of that demand.
Third positive trend line has been export coal. That remains strong at our Terminals, both on the East Coast and along the Gulf Coast.
And a fourth positive is that, as we all know, there's lots of drilling in the wet gas shale plays, and that additional drilling and production is leading to increased demand for the kind of infrastructure that we have in our footprint.
Now I don't suppose there's ever a quarter or a year where there aren't negatives that partially offset the positives, and there are some negative trend lines as we see it today. So on the other side of the coin, we're experiencing weak refined products demand. We're seeing weakening domestic coal shipments. We're seeing a flattening of steel throughput across our system. And as you all know, we're seeing drilling declines in some of the dry gas plays. So that's sort of an idea of some of the trends that are affecting all of our companies.
Now let me conclude with the EPB. There, we increased the quarterly distribution per unit to $0.58, that's up 18% over the third quarter of 2011. The distributable cash flow per unit was $0.71 versus $0.55 a year ago, that's up 29%. If you look at it year-to-date, '12 versus '11, it's $2.06 versus $1.89, or up 9%. These solid results really came across EPB's assets, driven by the drop-down that they got in May just before the El Paso-Kinder Morgan merger closed. And it was helped by additional demand for gas for power generation on both SNG and CIG, as I just detailed a moment ago.
So in summary, we think the Kinder Morgan assets are generating record amounts of cash. We think we're very well positioned for the future, and we expect our footprint to continue to drive sustained growth in the months and years to come.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

We recognized an additional valuation adjustments in the quarter of $178 million related to the SEC asset. This valuation is based on a signed contract. And so other than small working capital changes, we wouldn't anticipate any significant changes in the future quarters. Of the $178 million, KMI is going to reimburse KMP $45 million of that. So the real economic impact of that is $133 million. But for GAAP purposes, that contribution by KMI will be shown as the capital contribution and will impact the balance sheet and not the income statement.
The other thing I'll point out on this and we'll go through it, you'll see it more on the next page, is that because assets moved from KMI to KMP and because of their related entities, there are some special accounting rules. And so we have to go back and recap KMP's prior financials as if it owned EPB and the 50% of EPNG from May 24, the date they were acquired by KMP -- I mean, they were acquired by KMI. And so you'll see on the next page that we will pull out that income because KMP -- KMI got the cash from those operation, and KMP did not receive the economic benefits.
Pushing to the next page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow and what we use to -- what we base the dividend that we declare on. The DCF per unit for the quarter is $1.28. That compares to what we're declaring, $1.26. So about $6 million of coverage in the quarter. $3.72 year-to-date versus declared distribution of $3.69. So about $8 million of coverage year-to-date. For the full year, as Rich said, we still expect to distribute $4.98 per unit and we expect to generate coverage slightly above the distribution. That's a little bit better than what we talked about on the second quarter call, and that's just the result of a little bit better performance coming out of the segments and a little bit lower interest expense.
Now looking at DCF, on a total basis, $455 million in the quarter, that's $61 million increase or 15% increase over third quarter 2011, and $1 billion -- $1.28 billion in the 9 months, which is an $80 -- $183 million increase or 17% over the 9 months 2011. Looking at where that $61 million of growth came from and the $183 million for the 9 months, if you look out at the top of the page, this segment -- $1.14 billion in earnings before DD&A, that's up $199 million on the quarter or 21%. And if you look at this segment, about 90% of that growth came from gas and CO2, and a similar story for the 9 months, $456 million of growth in the 9 months, 17%, again, with about 90% of that coming from gas and CO2 segment. So looking at the individual segments, products was up $7 million in the quarter. It's down $6 million year-to-date. On the quarter, we had 9 contributions from Cochin, and we had a very favorable volumes there. They were up 40% due to a new contract on an expansion project. We also had a favorable tax adjustment. Transmix, we benefited from pricing. And Southeast Terminals, we benefited from acquisitions and higher volumes.
For the year, products, we expect to finish slightly below its budget, and they are slightly below their budget year-to-date. And that is Transmix, we had a contract that expired there. Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate, the volumes came online a little bit later than what we anticipated. Ultimately, we think the volumes will be there, and it's just a timing issue. And then we've had lower volumes on SSTP and CALNEV, our West Coast pipeline, given lower demand and also competition from another pipeline. Those negatives have been then partially offset by nice volumes and a shipper settlement on our Cochin platform.
Natural gas for the quarter, up $136 million year-to-date, up $239 million. As Rich said, significant benefit from the drops in the quarter. In the quarter, we also benefited from an acquisition that we did in the fourth quarter of last year on our treating business, as well as just better base performance there. In the Eagle Ford, we benefited from our JV that commenced shipping volumes in August of last year. We also benefited from a ramp-up in volumes of our Fayetteville Express Pipeline. And then those positives were somewhat offset by lower results on our pipes in the Rockies as a result of excess pipe capacity there. And also, on the Texas Intrastate, where we had an unexpected storage repair and some O&M timing. Year-to-date, natural gas is $96 million above its budget. For the full year, we expect it to be significantly exceeding its budget. And that is the result of the drops, net of the loss income from the FTC sale. Absent those 2 transactions, natural gas would be down for the year versus its budget. And that's just a function of the lower volumes in the dry gas area, primarily on KinderHawk, as well as a slower ramp-up in volumes versus what we expected in our budget in the Eagle Ford. CO2 is up $45 million in the quarter. It's up $176 million year-to-date.
In the quarter, oil volumes were up; 1,400 barrels a day on a net basis, that was primarily capped at SACROC. EGL barrels were up 900 barrels per day. Oil prices were up, and then that was somewhat -- those positives were somewhat offset by NGL pricing down about $25 a barrel. Year-to-date, CO2 is below its budget and we expect them to be modestly below their budget for the full year. About $50 million, which is all a function and actually, more -- all function of more of the NGL prices.
Terminals up $3 million in the quarter. It's up $37 million year-to-date. The growth in the quarter, about half of that was internal growth that came from -- on the liquids Terminals, for new contracts at higher rates, expansion projects, higher volume and then a -- and then export coal volumes. It is -- Terminals is slightly below their budget year-to-date, but we expect them to be on budget for the year, primarily as a result of stronger export coal volumes, offsetting reduced domestic coal and weaker steel volume.
Kinder Morgan Canada, up $8 million in the quarter. It's up $10 million year-to-date, and it's up $10 million versus its budget year-to-date, and we expect it to exceed its budget for the year. And that's a function of higher volumes, both on Trans Mountain and Express, favorable booked taxes and then favorable incentive management fee that we get paid on Express, due to the higher volume.
G&A, if you drop down about 6 -- 4 lines, G&A in the quarter, up $13 million. It's up $23 million year-to-date, and in the quarter, it's almost solely attributable to the TGP acquisition. Year-to-date versus our budget, we are within 1% of our budget if you exclude the TGP acquisition. So TGP G&A accounts for most of the variance year-to-date versus our budget. And we expect to be over our budget for the full year as a result of G&A associated with TGP.
Interest -- it's $40 million increase in the quarter, $59 million year-to-date, almost solely attributable to increased balance. We did get a small benefit from lower rates in the year-to-date numbers. Versus our budget, we expect to be negative both -- we are negative year-to-date -- on the -- versus the budget. We expect to be negative versus the budget for the full year as a result of the drop-down. If you take out the impact of the drop-down, our interest expense would be positive for the year versus our budget due to lower rates.
Looking at sustaining CapEx, it's up $23 million in the quarter. It's up $34 million year-to-date. It's actually positive versus our budget year-to-date. But that's timing. For the full year, we expect to be about $58 million above our budget. But that is attributable to the drop-downs. Without the drop-down, the remaining business segments in aggregate would be very close to their budget.
Looking at the certain items for the quarter, we talked about the loss on remeasurement of $178 million. That's the biggest piece of the total certain items, which are $191 million. The other 2 large certain items are the 3 acquisition earnings allocated to the general partner. These are the earnings that KMP picked up for GAAP purposes prior to its acquisition date, and then we took a non-cash environmental reserve of $34 million. So that's the distributable cash flow for the quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet, you will see that there's a significant change in total assets, about a $9.5 billion increase compared to 12/31/2011. And other than recurring items, there are 2 significant events impacting the balance sheet, which are the 2 significant -- the 2 transactions, the FTC sale and the drop-down. We talked about the FTC sales last quarter, which has the impact of moving assets from long term to current and classifying them as held for sale. And then the drop-down, the impact of this is that we have to record the drop-downs at KMI's book value. So KMP records them at KMI's book value even though it paid a different price. And in this case, it paid less in KMI's book value. And so you're going to see a large change in partners' capital. You'll see a $3.2 billion change in partners' capital. A significant portion of that $3.2 billion in partners' capital is the difference between the book value that we had to record these assets, which is KMI's book value; and the price that KMP paid. And that's considered a general partner contribution.
Debt-to-EBITDA for the quarter, 4x. Now that is pro forma for the sale of the FTC assets. The -- we expected that the FTC assets will close in November, and that we will use all those proceeds to pay down debt. And so it's just a timing issue. We expect that we should let, as you can see on the footnote, $1.76 billion. And so if you adjust our debt for that, we're 4x. Without that adjustment, debt-to-EBITDA would be at 4.4x.
If you look at debt, we ended the quarter at $7.4 billion, that's a change versus 6/30 of about $4.8 billion, so $4.8 billion increase in debt. As I said, there's about $1.8 billion of additional reduction that will happen. So if you netted that off, we would have only a $3 billion increase in debt. But reconciling the $4.8 billion for you is -- basically, there are $6.2 billion in acquisition, CapEx and contributions to equity investments and we raised about $1.4 billion in equity. And just to go through a little bit more detail, the drop value and my $6.2 billion is $5.66 billion. And all that is the $6.22 billion that you've seen in the press, less our share of that joint -- EPNG joint venture debt, which is not on our balance sheet. And so that's the biggest part of the acquisition. Expansion capital is about $388 million. The contributions to equity investments, $70 million.
On the $1.4 billion raised, we raised about $727 million from the KMR offering. KMI sit back about $400 million in the drop-down transactions. We raised about $120 million in the ATM under the KMR distributions or about $125 million. So that's KMP.
Now I will move to EPB -- oh, and just on KMP, we expect to end the year debt-to-EBITDA around 3.8x, just slightly better than what I mentioned on the last quarter call, which was 3.9x.
Looking at EPB, again, we don't consider the GAAP income statement overly helpful in understanding our business. It does show the declared distribution per unit for the quarter of the $0.58. So on the second page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow, distributable cash flow per unit was $0.71 in the quarter. So compared to the dividend or the distribution of $0.58, that's a little over $25 million of coverage in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have declared dividends of $2 -- or distributions of $2.06. That compares to -- or, sorry, we generated cash flow of $2.06. We have declared distributions of $1.64. And so, that's $87 million of coverage year-to-date.
Looking at the distributable cash flow on a whole number, $149 million in the quarter. That's up $36 million or 32% versus the third quarter of last year. $427 million for the 9 months, which is up $58 million or 16% versus a year ago.
Looking at what drove the growth up $36 million and $58 million for the 9 months, if you look out at the segment, earnings before DD&A, up $43 million. But as we discussed last quarter, that doesn't tell the whole story because EPB has acquired partial interest in pipelines from El Paso for -- and the way that, that shows up on the income statement is that it reduces your non-controlling interest expenses they acquired as additional interest. And so you have to look down to the non-controlling interest. So in the quarter, $43 million in earnings before DD&A. The non-controlling interest was reduced by about $4 million. So $47 million in growth coming out of the assets. About $25 million of that is associated with acquisitions, primarily Cheyenne Plain, and about $22 million of that is associated with the other assets that we owned at both periods, primarily expansions on Southern Natural Gas and increased gas firepower generation demand.
There was about $12 million when you add together G&A, interest, the GP -- the increased GP incentive and sustaining CapEx offsetting that $47 million. The G&A was lower, primarily due to cost savings, as well as sustaining CapEx was lower due to cost savings. Interest was higher given more debt and the GP interest was an increase given the higher distribution per unit and more units outstanding. And so you now have the $12 million from the $47 million, that gives you about $35 million in growth on distributable cash flow.
For the year, $50 million increase in earnings before DD&A. Again, looking down the page, you see a decrease in non-controlling interest expense of about $34 million. So about $84 million in growth, a little over $60 million that comes from the acquisition, and the balance is coming from  assets on the both periods, primarily Southern Natural Gas. Offsetting that is about $30 million of increased expense, primarily increased interest expense and increased GP incentive to get you to the $58 million in growth.
For the full year, as we said in the press release, we're still expecting to distribute $2.25 and have over $95 million in coverage.
On EPB's balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter debt-to-EBITDA 4.2x. That's up a little bit from 12/31 of 2011. But it's down from the second quarter, which we reported at 4.7x. It's down for the quarter primarily because we did the equity offering in order to put the long-term financing in place on the drop-downs that were done during the second quarter.
Debt is decreased by about $304 million in the quarter and just to reconcile that for you, we spent about $14 million in expansion CapEx, we issued $278 million in EPB units, we had about $26 million in excess coverage and then there was about $14 million in working capital and other items.
Turning to KMI, as I said last quarter, the first page is our cash available for dividends, which we think is the most important measure for KMI. We tried to divide it into 2 sections: the top section, which we -- is the cash generated from the GP and LP interest in KMP and EPB, which I'll refer to as the GP section; the bottom section, which you can see is entitled, ""El Paso Corporation's Cash Available for Distribution"", is the asset section. And those are assets that we ultimately think will be dropped to the MLPs. As I said last quarter, it's not perfect. All the cash taxes, they're up in the top section. And all the acquisition interest as well as the EPC interest, some of which will remain after we get all the assets dropped or in the bottom section.
The other thing we've done on the schedule is we pulled out the transaction cost to give you a sense of the recurring cash flow. But we detailed those for you in Footnote 11.
Looking at the quarter, we generated $362 million of cash available to pay dividends. That's almost double what we generated in the third quarter of last year. That translates into $0.35 per share that compares to our declared distribution of $0.36 per share. So we have about $12 million of negative coverage. So that is what we expect in the second and the third quarter, given the timing of interest payments and tax payments.
For the 9 months, $972 million, which is $349 million above the 9 months ended in 2011, that's $1.13 per share compared to the declared distribution of $1.03. So a little over $75 million in coverage year-to-date.
For the full year, we expect cash available to be over $1.325 billion, and we still expect to pay at least $1.40. Looking at where the growth came from, the $174 million on the quarter and $349 million year-to-date, on the quarter, the increase from $429 million -- to $429 million from $354 million, $78 million increase in KMP's distribution to us. EPB distribution to us, $92 million increase due to the acquisition. So between our 2 interests in the MLPs, $170 million increase. That's offset by about $41 million increase in interest, taxes and G&A. The largest piece of that $41 million is $33 million increase in taxes, which is associated with the higher income.
The cash available from the EPC assets, $48 million. And then we had a $3 million decrease in NGPL Cash Available for Distribution. That
takes you to the $1.74. 
For the 9 months, $171 million increase in KMP's distribution to us, $174 million comes from the general partner and limited partner interests in EPC. So $345 million year-to-date coming from the 2 interests in MLP.
There's an increase in interest and taxes and G&A of $66 million. Again, the biggest piece of that is over $50 million increase in taxes due to the higher income; $86 million coming from the EPC assets; and then NGPL is down about $16 million take you to $349 million in gross year-to-date.
On KMI's balance sheet, looking down at the debt on KMI, we ended the quarter at $11.2 billion. Now that's up from $3.2 billion at the end of last year, but it's down from the $16.4 billion where we ended the second quarter. And so just very, very roughly and broadly, we started the year at $3 billion. We took on roughly $13 billion in the El Paso transaction between transaction itself and some of the transaction-related expenses. We paid down $5 billion in this quarter, and that leaves us at $11 billion. So when you look at the $5 billion pay-down in the quarter, it's actually $5.2 billion that we paid down. We got $5.275 billion of debt reductions coming from the drop-down. And that's $3.5 billion in cash that KMI got from those -- from KMP for those drop-downs, and then $1.8 billion in debt moved from KMI to KMP. It was debt on TGP that was assumed by KMP in the transaction. We had about $146 million in transaction-related expenses. The biggest piece of that was related to the El Paso merger litigation that we've now resolved. And then we also had $137 million in transaction-related tax benefits, primarily tax benefits related to the deferred comp that got paid at the closing of the transaction. So when you net those 2, it's $9 million of cash outflows associated with the transaction.
We repurchased $26 million in warrants. As you know, we include KMR in the cash available for dividends as this is assets as if it was cash. We did not sell those shares in the quarter, so we've not yet converted that to cash. And then we made a little over $40 million in contribution to the 2 MLPs to maintain the 2% interest, and also in JV contributions to the JVs that are still held at KMI and expansion capital. And then we had $10 million in working capital and other items. And so that gets you to the $5.2 billion or, rounded, $5 billion reduction in debt. So that's it."

The first is on the ramp in crude oil and condensate volumes that were detailed in your prepared commentary. How do you think about leveraging the $200 million investment in that condensate processing facility because you've got ample storage capacity at Galena Park, and, obviously, it looks like volumes of crude and condensate from the Eagle Ford are going to be moving through a lot of those new pipes that you've detailed. So is this the type of project where you could become more vertically integrated to the extent that capacity even exceeds that 100,000 barrel-a-day upside that you guys want?"

Now of course, as we've pointed out last quarter, another very strange hook-up to this whole thing is the reversal of Cochin, which is actually, in the end, we believe, going to be used to move really oil [ph] processed out of the condensate coming out of Eagle Ford and moved all the way back up into Alberta. So there's a lot of things here we're continuing to explore, but I think we have a tremendous position, a great footprint here, and we're going to use it to every extent we can."

But maybe -- but I can give you some color on how things are going. Clearly, on TGP, obviously, the ability to access production from the Marcellus and the Utica is a tremendous plus. We're seeing all kinds of opportunities for expansions, some of which we've detailed in the earnings release and some of which are not quite to that stage yet to be released. But we're seeing very good demand on the Eastern part or downstream part of that system. So we're very pleased with it. And it is performing a bit better than we expected. On EPNG, the drop there is actually now 50%; at KMP, it's still 50%. And KMI will drop another 50%, I'm sure, sometime next year. On that, again, we've made no secret of the fact that the great upside there is not due to California demand but the ability to drop off volumes along the way, particularly into Mexico. And we talk about the Sasabe project, which, at $200 million-plus project, which would hook into additional volumes that would be picked up on the brand-new pipeline being built by other parties down in Mexico. We will hook at -- hook up at the border near Sasabe, Arizona. So just a lot of potential to drop more volumes off. And when you do that, we believe we will end up with more than one lateral going down there. And when that happens, you have 2 things: You earn on the money you've spent on those laterals, plus you're filling some of the capacity that is now not being utilized to ship gas to California. The other thing is that we continue to look at the potential to use portions of that system to convert it to other uses, perhaps moving crude oil west from the Permian Basin. That's very speculative at this point, but there are a lot of opportunities. It could be very exciting there. So we're very pleased with the way both of these are performing so far and look forward to a lot of upside opportunities in 2013 and beyond."

We think we will be able to do something, although it's a little more preliminary than our efforts on Elba. We think there's a good chance we can do something there that again would have maybe one train on an FTA, and then we've had to wait to get larger to see whether we get approval from DOE on a non-FTA. Our whole process in this is very conservative, I think, we don't want to spend a lot of money cranking up, based on getting non-FTA approval. So we're working very hard to secure commitments that are binding even without non-FTA approval. And so the whole projects would be constructed that way.

We applied to the NEB, National Energy Board, to do a bifurcated process. And we said we wanted to come in first and get approval on the total arrangement that we had with our customers who signed 20-year agreements with us. There were some opposition to that. The NEB just recently ruled in our favor that they would proceed on that basis and set the first -- the hearing on that issue. Now this is not the environmental permitting or routing issues. This is just approving the toll structure so that we know -- we and our customers know that our contractual arrangements for 20 years have been blessed by the regulator. That's going to start in February, and we believe that will be brought to conclusion, hopefully with approval for the process as we've structured it, by some time -- about this time next year. Then we are working with all of the applicable constituencies here, from First Nations to people who are along the pipeline right of way to users, to consult with them on moving forward toward the filing that we will make in late '13 for the environmental and routing permits to actually get the permit to construct the line. And that will be a, we know, a long process. We are going to try to do as much as we can to satisfy people's concerns before the hearing opens. We're not naive. We know that there will still be opposition and that the NEB will have to balance the interest of a lot of different players here. But we certainly believe, given the economic advantages to the country of Canada and certainly to the producers in Alberta and the favorable tax benefits that this project will have for Canada, for B.C. and for Alberta, that we certainly think we're on the right side of the arguments. But I've never minimized it, never guaranteed anything here. We think we have a very good case, and we intend to make it."

But since the last quarter, our projects on the terminal side have gone up by over $100 million.

We haven't included all of the -- as I said, all of the projects that seemingly are out there. What we've tried to do in that, and it's really over $11 billion now, we have tried to -- and that -- and we're going to share with you at our analyst conference exactly where we stand project by project. But we've tried to foot -- to -- with projects that are really in advanced stages where we either have customer commitments or we have letters of intent to commit to customer commitments, that kind of thing. So these are very viable projects, and I think we're just going to continue to grow that backlog. I know I've said it until I'm blue in the face, and you guys are probably tired of hearing it, but you cannot overemphasize the power of the footprint that we now have in North America. And we are going to drive that footprint as hard as we possibly can only when the projects make sense on an economic basis. But we're going to take advantage of that footprint to continue to get additional projects in the front door."

I'm not an expert in the shale plays and so forth, but things that I've seen in the public domain in terms of the break-even crude price required from many of them, the average is around $60 a barrel to get an NPV of $15. I think CO2 flooding is a little bit below that but not way out of that range, and I really can't take that commentary much further. With respect to CO2 demand, we are presently turning customers away that want more. I wish that, that was not the answer, and that's clearly a driver for our St. Johns acquisition and development planning that we're doing now, but we have customers that are taking virtually all of their contract quantities and wanting to increase them. And quite frankly, we've had some modest proration this past year. We may have a bit of that next year as well until we could expand Doe Canyon and get it online at the end of next year and do further expansions at McElmo Dome that will be forthcoming. So it's been a great market. There's a lot of activity in the Permian, and it's going our way as well as other directions as well."
