In a few minutes, I'll hand the conference over to Sabrina, who'll take you through 2011 highlights and also talk to you about our guidance and some key metrics for 2012. So before we get to that, I want to take you through a couple of thoughts I had on this past year and also talk to you about where I see 2012 in terms of the company's strategic plan and what investments we see ourselves making in the upcoming year. In spite of 2011 earnings being below last year, we actually did make quite a bit of progress against our strategic plan. So we have 2 key initiatives that Gap Inc. has been pursuing over the last 4 years that make up our strategic plan.
The first key initiative is to reduce our dependency on our North American specialty bricks and mortar business. So we did accomplish quite a bit on that front in 2011. First off, we grew our online business and penetration to our total sales by 2 percentage points. Second thing we did, we reduced our specialty square footage by over 4% while at the same time growing our outlet square footage domestically by 4%. We closed 65 stores domestically and we opened up 8 Athleta stores, very successful, I may add, and that makes us feel very good about our future for 2012 and beyond.
The second area which we made quite a bit of progress is our move to expand our brand internationally. At the beginning of the year, we operated in 31 countries combination of franchised and company-owned stores, and we ended 2011 by operating in 39 countries. In China, we opened 10 stores and finished the year with 14 stores and feel very good about the progress we're making in China, particularly in Hong Kong. And in 2012, we have a plan right now to open 30 stores. Franchise business where we opened 50 stores and good performance were seen in our franchise business and we grew total year 2011 at greater than 40%, and we see an opportunity to open at least 50 stores in 2012. We added global outlet into Italy, in Japan, in the U.K. and will be taken our global outlet business to China in the fall of 2012.
And lastly, Banana Republic opened up in Paris is into Champs-Élysées beautiful store and that will be the beginning of Banana Republic expanding into France. As we go come into 2012, our goal clearly is to advance our strategic plan at this fiscal year while at the same time improving our sales and earnings profile of the corporation. So in order to ensure success, one of my key mandates for 2011 was to make sure the business took appropriate corrective measures in some key areas to make sure we can deliver on that latter goal of improving our sales and earnings profile of 2012.
So there's 4 areas that we've been focused on in the last fiscal year: product, our assortment, our marketing and our supply chain. So let me first talk about product. Probably the biggest change we made throughout the year in 2011 was the creation of the GAAP Global Creative Center in New York City. That was bringing together from the domestic and international perspective design, marketing and production to create one amazing hub of creativity to New York City for all of our stores around the world. And really the first output from that team just showed up in our stores globally 2 weeks ago. I really like the progress I've seen that Pam Wallack's leadership in New York. The other changes have been quite a bit of investment in people that we started to make through the year and continue to make going forward. The first one that came out was the creation of this creative advisor goal. Tracy Gardner joined us about 4 weeks ago. We just announced that Jill Stanton will be creative advisor of note Old Navy. Jill has an amazing background in Next, Marks & Spencer and Nike globally.
This is a new role but it's critical to me to get to consistent product execution. One of the conclusions we came to through years is we need to add this role to work with our designers integrate a nice bridge between the design teams and the merchandising teams. So really quite a bit of development along product. With everything we're doing, the goal is clear here. We need to have consistent product execution every quarter, every year across our brands.
We focus on assortment at the latter part of 2011. Probably driven by the spike in cotton pricing in value businesses. We got a little off balance between basics and fashion, and also we got a little bit off between our opening price point product and our best product. Those changes have been made, and Old Navy's assortment will be much better balance between the areas I talked about between April and May.
Marketing was quite a bit of work in 2011. I'm really excited. When I look at all of our brands, we are either starting the year with a brand new marketing platform or a modified platform in order to make sure we got a great return for our marketing and really drive brand equity and traffic. So Old Navy, we modified the  platform that we introduced in November. The real modification the product shows us that if it's a great platform. It's so Old Navy as well as it should. Those modifications are being made.
Brand-new platform at Gap came out 2 weeks ago. right. It's a global campaign and really think we have a great idea. Banana Republic you'll see in the marketing that came out this spring will focus on what you're calling internally new work. The marketing is about that. It's showing up on the windows. It's showing up in-store. How does Banana Republic as it did a decade ago redefine what work is. And Athleta came up with a brand new platform called power to the sheet. Very appropriate for the Athleta business as we add from our 10 stores we currently have and add 25 new stores in 2012. The campaign is going to be so important for them.
And lastly, we made some adjustments to our supply chain. We brought our distribution and logistics team together brought and merged it with our sourcing team to create 1 supply chain team, lead by Colin Funnel, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain. Same time, we also changed how we go to market. For years, we've had a geographically-based hub structure and we've moved to category teams, and we've added a lot of talent. New leadership in India, new leadership in Hong Kong. That's critical to make sure our supply chain efforts in 2012 and beyond really bring great value to the Corporation.
And lastly, as I do every year on the February call, I have to talk about the investments the company wants to make in 2012. Once again, the support its strategic plan. SG&A, to me, has 2 really distinct components inside of it. There's a fixed company which companies to spend every single year and there's a variable component. And the time we spend as a management team is always discussing in advance of a new year where we're going to place our bets, where we're going to best money, not only to achieve our strategic plan but get a great return to drive sales and earnings inside the business. Examples of that were in 2010 where the highlights of that year were about China, about global online.
Last year, we talked about opening up Italy and expanding our and Athleta business. So as we enter 2012, we're going to continue with our International expansion. But what you're going to hear a little differently is we're going to have a focus on putting some money back into our Domestic business in 3 key areas: in product, in marketing and in e-commerce.
On about up front, like a lot of other people in the industry, we expect to get some tailwinds in our cost of goods in the second half of 2012. So we made some decisions that we're going to make some investments very targeted, very specific in categories we know we can dominate on, but we can get a point of differentiation redefined. And really what the focus for me is categories I believe assets for the corporation. And so that's been the filter we're using. We want to make sure we get savings from the reduction of costs. We're going to make some targeted investments that's really going to benefit our Domestic business. So key categories in Banana Republic, Old Navy and in Gap brand is investment we're going to make in 2012. We're going to put some money behind Gap brand marketing. The time is right. We really believe in our team in the Gap Global Creative Center. And we're going to be putting somebody behind marketing for the new platform called  around the world but the real focus here in North America. I think our  team has done a lot of work in 2011 to position them, not only to drive our brand equity, but to make sure we're out there telling customers about it week in, week out, months in and month out, season in and season out. That's very important for 
And lastly, we're going to put some money as we have, really, the last couple of years but even stepped up amount behind our e-commerce business. We opened up a new distribution center in 2011. So we're going to have those costs to carryforward for all of 2012. But the real investment is in mobile. Our mobile platform has done extremely well. We have a lot of new ideas, innovative ideas, coming out from Toby and his team.
And the last area, which is really about global, is we're going to create a brand-new, global IT platform. Now when you open up in Italy and China and some of the plans we have for the business going forward, you have to be strong in IT, you have to be strong in supply chain. It's going to take us a number of years to get done to really create and build a brand-new global IT platform. So we enter 2012, everybody here at Gap, Inc. very focused on what we have to get done. We know what needs to be done and now we're very motivated as we come into the year to make sure that we take all of our brands to a new level and perform well domestically and internationally across every brand, every channel and every geography.
So with that said, let me hand it over to Sabrina who will take you through the financial highlights and I've been at them back after that and answer any questions from the analysts. Sabrina?"

I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in",1215,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in our performance.
Throughout the year, we delivered higher average unit retail, enabled by our disciplined inventory management. While continuing to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, we tightly managed our operating expenses which leveraged 30 basis points. We generated $800 million in free cash flow, and finally, we distributed $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the fourth quarter, net earnings were $218 million and earnings per share were $0.44. Full-year net earnings were $833 million and full-year earnings per share was $1.56, down 17%.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Fourth quarter total sales were $4.3 billion, down 2%. Full-year total sales were down 1% to $14.5 billion, and comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 4% for the year. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Since Q1 of 2011, we laid out our view that margins would contract significantly during the year, driven by the sharp escalation in average unit costs, especially in the back half. Further, we also said that we would deliver average unit retail up, but not up enough to offset the increase in average unit cost. The year did indeed play out this way. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was down 540 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margins were down 500 basis points while rent and occupancy deleveraged by 40 basis points. Gross profit was $1.4 billion.
For the full year, gross margin was 36.2%, down 400 basis points. Merchandise margins were down 370 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points. Gross profit for the year was $5.3 billion, down 10%.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. Given the high average unit cost this year, we managed our inventory units down so that our total inventory dollars per store remained reasonable. We're pleased that at the end of the fourth quarter, as indicated on our January sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was about flat.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. Given the decline in our gross margin dollars, we responded to mitigate the impact to earnings by managing our expenses tightly. And even as we continued to invest meaningfully in our International growth initiative, we leveraged Q4 operating expenses by 60 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1 billion. These expenses include $166 million of marketing, up slightly to last year. For the full year, total operating expenses were $3.8 billion, down $85 million from the prior year and leveraged as a percent of sales by 30 basis points. Full-year marketing expenses were $548 million, up $32 million for last year.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures. Full-year capital expenditures were $548 million, focused on International and the associated IT investment, Global Online and Old Navy downsizes. In line with our articulated strategy, in North America, we continued to reduce our square footage through closures and consolidations of Gap brand and downsizes at Old Navy. For the year, we closed 65 stores on a net basis and decreased square footage by 1.3 million square feet in North America. Outside of North America, we grew through both company-operated and franchise stores.
On a net basis, we added 33 International company-operated stores and 49 franchised stores. Total Gap Inc. net square footage was down 2.6% compared to last year. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash on Slide 10. We generated strong cash free flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, of $800 million, and we repurchased 111 million shares for $2.1 billion at an average price of $18.88. Our level of share repurchase for the year was higher than usual, enabled by our capital raising in the first quarter of 2011. We ended the year with 485 million shares outstanding.
Now I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect earnings per share for fiscal year 2012, which includes the 53rd week, to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80, and operating margin to be about 10%. Underlying that guidance are the following priorities: improving sales with healthy merchandise margins; investing in our business while maintaining disciplined; and returning excess cash to shareholders.
With regard to improving sales and delivering healthy merchandise margins. It's our objective to drive modest top line growth through the stabilization of our base businesses and a continuation of our global growth initiative which are focused on our online outlet and franchise channels.
Moving to margins. Clearly, cotton inflation had a significant impact on our average unit cost in 2011. As is commonly known in the sector, spring 2012 costs are up, though up less than holiday 2011. We are fairly confident that average unit costs will be improve in the second half of 2012. However, we've just begun to purchase the back half and are still finalizing our assortment and reinvestment decisions. Therefore, some uncertainty exists regarding exists regarding precisely where costing will land.
Our second priority is investing in our businesses while maintaining discipline. As Glenn discussed, After 5 years of extremely disciplined expense management, coupled with a focus on International growth, we are going to be investing more in our domestic businesses. As a result of that, it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses in 2012.
We'll obviously temper the level of investments depending upon our momentum and our likely return and we will update you as we proceed through the year. With regard to inventory, we plan to continue to manage inventory units in a disciplined manner and expect inventory dollars per store to be about flat at the end of Q1. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. As I mentioned, our 2011 share repurchases were higher than usual due to our capital raising. In 2012, we expect to return to a more normalized pace of share repurchases. And today, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
In addition, we plan to increase our annual dividend by $0.05 to $0.50 per share, representing a payout of nearly 30% of net earnings.
Please turn to Slide 12 for a summary of the guidance I just provided and some additional full-year 2012 metrics. Regarding company-operated stores. Net of repositions, we plan to open about 125 stores and close about 115. Store openings are weighted toward International and outlets, while store closures are weighted towards Gap specialty stores in North America. We expect net square footage to decrease by about 1%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $600 million, and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. And finally, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 39.5%.
In conclusion, as we enter a new year, we're committed to growing earnings per share while strategically reinvesting in the business. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Katrina."

And again, We're being selective, we're being targeted, we're making some key categories across our brands. And then what probably wasn't clear in the opening comments, then if you do that, that's part of the driver as to why you're seeing us put a little more marketing money into our domestic business because if you're going to do that, we have to out into the window, in-store, through social media, through other tools to let people know let people know that we have either done base investments in key categories like suiting up Banana Republic and there's list of categories we believe across all our brand. I believe that's going to generate some tension from customers and turn into traffic for our store. So just one area in which were doing now. In terms of promotional activity, I think that we're always challenging our team's and last year was not necessarily our best year on this front. We were much better at this 2010. It's funny to be innovative, really differentiated marketing, value proposition that bring people into the stores. If you look at something Old Navy started in 2012 was called Super Cash. I think ideas like that, that Gap can have a version Banana Republic, after that and, of course, Old Navy and our outlet stores need always find was innovative, what's unique, what does a customer really respond to? I think those 2 things in combination should be enough to at least give us an improvement on the traffic trajectory that we were disappointed in and 2011."

What I can say is that -- and I could take an exhaustive answer here and go brand by brand but it was commented at the beginning of the call on product. The change be made in New York City was that was a seismic shift for us. Because it really is bringing together the last pic design teams, the International design teams under one full global design team in New York City for Gap. So that team worked for about 10 months together. They worked through processes and we have to make sure we're all lined global aesthetic and there was work to be done. We all agreed 2011 was not our best foot forward at Gap. So that work just showed up in the store February 10, little bit later in some of our global markets but February 10 in North America. Then there's a lot in there that I feel good about. The work from in terms of the talent and bringing together those 2 teams, then the addition of the creative advisor role under Tracy. I'm starting to see at least, and I was in New York just recently, how they're working together, what decisions from a fashion and basic, the balance of the assortment, and the decisions those teams are making. I think they're really crystal-clear on the aesthetic going forward. The Banana Republic team, they start going through, not the same seismic shift that went on at Gap, but they addressed some of their content Women's and opposite number that helped the Banana Republic team have a 6 comp January. I believe they've been on top of making the changes they needed to make about 6 months ago. And there's some similar changes going on at Old Navy. So all in all, with the trends in the marketplace which are really highlighted by a real focus on color and demand of color, given our brands and what the American aesthetically stand for and the work that we've done corrective measures. Because the keepsake internally that anybody can good as can have a good month. We don't want to perform well and above where we've been which is our commitment based on the fact we're just lucky on a trend. We just want to make changes in the business that affect our business performance."

Japanese businesses, it's difficult for us to gauge given the incredible disaster they ceased in 3/11 last year, we have a big business in Japan, all the better sense of that coming into later in the spring and in the summer. But I like what the team is doing. I think -- happen to know that were being done in the Gap Global Creative Center is resonating well because the Japanese team. Some of the product has not gone to our customer yet but our team likes what they're seeing. Our Banana Republic businesses is going to probably the expand by a few stores in 2012. That's been on hold for a few years. I think that's good news and we'll open up Old Navy Japan on July 15, just outside of Tokyo. That leaves us with Europe. And our European business, like a lot of other companies, was soft in 2011. The team there was very aware of it. We have a small business in Italy. So really, what we're talking about for us is France and the U.K. Austerity measures were tough, we're not good enough in 2011. The product global at Gap Women's that hurt our overall global Gap business, particularly hit our business in Europe hard, did not register at all with the customers. Again, payments product in the European markets which we operate. So too soon to tell. That's going to be a tough market. That's a wait-and-see for us.

And that's really on track with what we laid out back in October to get to 17.5 in '13. With regard to Gap specialty, same. Right on track. We said we wanted to get to 700 stores by 2013. We'll be closing about 85 stores in North America specialty in '12, get us down to about 750. And at the same time, important other side of the strategy is to grow the Gap outlets in North America.

We've worked very hard, as we should've, given our performance in 2011. Worked really hard in the product front in getting clarity in each one of our design teams, whether that's addition of talent or it was just a better focus and part of that was the GC, the Gap Global Creative Center in New York City. And the confidence has picked up to a point where some market, I want to make sure I'm clear on this, some marketing will go into Q1. The investments I'm talking about will have to be the one earned and they will happen at probably if our business performs at the higher rate through the year. So it's driven by, if you're going to be making some changes in product and get it right on to the customer in which we need to attract our stores, you've got to go tell that story. We have a lot of marketing in the business. I want to make sure I'm clear about that. So it's a Gap story mostly in domestic, mostly in North America. Old Navy had plenty of marketing. Their issue in 2011 was it wasn't effective, as we said a number of times on these calls, maybe aren't as transparent as we are. We were not happy with our marketing up until November when the new platform came out. On the sourcing, the team is just being put together now. We were very pleased with our geographical hub structure up until 2011. Could've made the change then to a more category structure versus aligning all the way through our business from design to merchandising through production through sourcing by categories. But given the spike in cotton, we decided to not do with at that time because we have enough disruptions going on, enough stress in the business to try to manage our way through that challenge. We're in the early days, Jeff. Let's see. This is the month of February. So the team that's been put in place from a category perspective, they're first in back in the business will probably our holiday buying which we haven't even begun just yet. So they'll probably have some impact on holidays. The real benefit to me of the category hub structure, it allows us to build a much deeper relationships with the mills upstream which we do not have today. That's a missed opportunity in our sourcing. We do the old mills. we will going forward in the category structure hub and the category leader relationship with the mills much stronger. And I think some of that benefit that I hope won't be materialized could come in the holiday but most of that will be 2013."

Again, it's going to be very targeted in key categories and that we can dominate in selective brands. That's one of the longest lead times. So I would say that one, as I know today, will likely be the most amount of pure dollars will go into that area. But we also -- we've done some tests ahead of time, some categories, to make sure we can resonate with customers. It will be noticed and we get paid for it. But we will be watching it through the year to make sure that those that that outcome actually happens. Marketing would be the next one in line but that has much more flexibility, much shorter lead times. And e-commerce, I talked about the new Phoenix distribution center where got up in full operation in the fall of 2011. There's some mobile investments out there that may get some investments in people that goes into that business as well. And probably the lesser of the money we are spending as we do every year stated in the beginning, we are always decide what variables as G&A we want to put in the business to deliver the strategic plan but also to hit the framework of the economic model the company needs to have. In terms of what percent we'll build, here's what they'll tell you: we're and that best, just finishing our fall buy right now. We haven't even started ending on holiday. We had choices like we have across all of the centers in business. One, negotiate as hard as we as we can which is regarded do regardless, and get savings through the assumption of tailwinds at the back half to pull all of that money in the bottom line of the business. But also we had it choice of pack and go. Where do we believe? We can actually get a win in certain key categories across brands and give our designers and merchandisers a little bit of license to put some our money back into product and just one last point on that. When you take a product, to me, it starts with fit, which was no more money. Just want to have great fit them consistently good than the ghost politico doesn't cost any money you got to have the right color for the season. Then it goes to style which should be print and pattern as well. It doesn't cost any more money then we get the fabric. So our designers and merchants know that in order to have excellent, consistent great product season in, season out, you to deliver on all 4 of those. All we're trying to highlight today is there are some areas putting money back to the fabric does make strategic sense to us."

Obviously, we put out a range, Stacy. So we do lots of scenarios. And the range that we've guided to is the best reflection of what we believe are the most probable outcomes with the info we have today. So there are a range of scenarios for both AUC, and just as a reminder, what I said was we are fairly confident we will get costing improvement in the back half. There still is uncertainty because we said, and Glenn just reminded, we just started buying the back half. And this allowed some decisions not only the variables that are macro factors like cotton and labor and all of that, but there's also just our merchants who are making decisions about the mix of assortment, where they'll reinvest. But all that said, we think we're fairly confident caught and that costing will improve in the back half and our range includes scenarios with improvements. With regard to share repurchase, we also have embedded a range of share repurchases. Now I think it's important that I just underscore, again, we're trying to signal that we are absolutely committed to cash distributions as we have been for many, many years. Nothing in our principal has changed. But definitely, 2012 will be a more normalized, what we consider normalized year share repurchases. And if you look back over the last whatever, 6, 7 years, we sort of averaged $1 billion, $1.3 billion per year. And the timing obviously, matters about those share repurchases and now accretive they are in their back-half-weighted, front half weighted, et cetera."

We've never given specific numbers but we do embed in our 10-Qs some qualitative flavor that is helpful to our expense management. We did get a nice increase in 2011 and we wouldn't expect that 10-Q that same kind of increase in '11 in '12. And the reason is '11 seems to be a really unique year with balances of our customers sort of growing. I guess, that's maybe a sign that people are getting more confident as the economy improves and stabilizes. But the loss rates have stayed pretty low. I think that's fairly unique circumstances. So we're not counting on the same level of growth in the program in '12 as we did in '11."

And the AUC pieces just, making sure that our sourcing and production teams can get us the best cost and leverage the size of the company.  I will say, Paul, that in 2011, given this unique year certainly the back half as we spoke about the significant increases in our cost of goods, our teams were much more aware of AUC. Those that had to had to price AIR, those that had to make AUR decisions were much more aware of it. The main in 2012, there's 2 components that are changing waste of my opening comments: One, from an assortment that assortment perspective at Old Navy in particular, we felt that we got a little bit off on the spreading of our price points under a good, better, best strategy best strategy. Got to look too far up the best category and that's going to be managed back up to a better balance inside good, better, best. So that's one change that is certainly happening. And then our value business, our outlet business and in Old Navy, because of the significant increases that really impacted them in 2011 in the back half, there's a few areas we cross thresholds with customers. Those adjustments are going to have to be made. And we're going to go back to we operate the business in 2010 which is really making sure that merchants are 100% focused on the value proposition in the business. And then the production team getting the best cost possible but not having the relationship be so directly affected one to the other as we did in the back half of '11, given the huge increases."

We're going to be a group like that. I want to remind everybody this is category that had very little inflation for the better part of 20 years. That's the first time we've seen some inflation. And the market leaders on price will be dictating a lot of this and people control the floor will be sending signals through everybody, whether they believe the price levels and whatever inflation was allowed to come through in a level in 2011 should sustain itself in 2012.

In a few minutes, I'll hand the conference call over to Sabrina, who'll take you through 2011 highlights and also talk to you about our guidance and some key metrics for 2012. So before we get to that, I want to take you through a couple of thoughts I had on this past year and also talk to you about where I see 2012 in terms of the company's strategic plan and what investments we see ourselves making in the upcoming year. In spite of 2011 earnings being below last year, we actually did make quite a bit of progress against our strategic plan. So we have 2 key initiatives that Gap Inc. has been pursuing for the last 4 years that make up our strategic plan.
The first key initiative is to reduce our dependency on our North American specialty bricks and mortar business. So we did accomplish quite a bit on that front in 2011. First off, we grew our online business of penetration to our total sales by 2 percentage points. The second thing we did is we reduced our specialty square footage by over 4%, while at the same time growing our outlet square footage domestically by 4%. We closed 65 stores domestically and we opened up 8 Athleta stores, very successful, I may add, and that makes us feel very good about our future for 2012 and beyond.
The second area which we made quite a bit of progress is our move to expand our brand internationally. At the beginning of the year, we operate in 31 countries, combination of franchised and company-owned stores, and we ended 2011 by operating in 39 countries. In China, we opened 10 stores. We finished the year with 14 stores and feel very good about the progress we're making in China, particularly in Hong Kong. And in 2012, we have a plan right now to open 30 stores. Franchise business, where we opened 50 stores and good performance were seen in our franchise business and we grew total year 2011 at greater than 40%, and we see an opportunity to open at least 50 stores in 2012. We added global outlet into Italy, in Japan, in the U.K. and we'll be taking our global outlet business to China in the fall of 2012.
And lastly, Banana Republic opened up in Paris, in the Champs-Élysées, and a beautiful store and that will be the beginning of Banana Republic expanding into France. As we come into 2012, our goal clearly is to advance our strategic plan in this fiscal year, while at the same time improving our sales and earnings profile of the corporation. 
So in order to ensure success, one of my key mandates through 2011 was to make sure the business took appropriate corrective measures in some key areas to make sure we can deliver on that latter goal of improving our sales and earnings profile on 2012.
So there's 4 areas that we've been focused on in the last fiscal year: product; our assortment; our marketing; and our supply chain. So let me first talk about product. Probably the biggest change we made throughout the year in 2011 was the creation of the Gap Global Creative Center in New York City. That was the bringing together, from a domestic and international perspective, design, marketing and production to create one amazing hub of creativity at New York City for all of our stores around the world. Really, the first output from that team just showed up in our stores globally 2 weeks ago. I really like the progress I've seen that's come out under Pam Wallack's leadership in New York. The other changes have been quite a bit of investment in people that we started to make through the year and continue to make going forward. The first one that came out was the creation of this Creative Advisor role. Tracy Gardner joined us about 4 weeks ago. We just announced that Jill Stanton will be Creative Advisor at Old Navy. Jill has an amazing background in Next, Marks & Spencer and Nike globally.
This is a new role, but it's critical to me to get to consistent product execution. One of the conclusions we came to through the year is we need to add this role to work with our designers and create a nice bridge between the design teams and the merchandising teams. So really quite a bit of development along product. With everything we're doing, the goal is clear here. We need to have consistent product execution every quarter, every year across all our brands.
We focused on assortment at the latter part of 2011, and probably driven by the spike in cotton pricing in value businesses. We got a little off balance between basics and fashion and also we got a little bit off between our opening price point product and our best product. Those changes have been made, and Old Navy's assortment will be much better balanced between the areas I talked about coming into April and May.
Marketing was quite a bit of work in 2011. I'm really excited. If I look at all of our brands, we are either starting the year with a brand new marketing platform or a modified platform in order to make sure we got a great return for our marketing and really drive brand equity and traffic. So Old Navy, we modified the Funnovations Inc. platform that we introduced in November, and the real modification is make sure the product shows up better. I mean, it's a great platform. It's so Old Navy, but the product doesn't show up as well as it should. Those modifications are being made.
Brand new platform at Gap, came out 2 weeks ago, Be Bright. It's a global campaign and we really think we have a great idea. Banana Republic, you'll see in the marketing that came out this spring, a real focus on what we're calling internally new work. The marketing is about that. It's showing up in the windows. It's showing up in store. How does Banana Republic as it did a decade ago redefine what work is. And Athleta came up with a brand new platform called Power to the She. Very appropriate for the Athleta business as we add, from our 10 stores we currently have and add 25 new stores in 2012. The campaign is going to be so important for them.
And lastly, we made some adjustments to our supply chain. We brought our distribution and logistics team together and merged it with our sourcing team to create one supply chain team, lead by Colin Funnell , our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain. Same time, we also changed how we go to market. For years, we've had a geographically based hub structure and we moved to category teams and we've added a lot of new talent. New leadership in India, new leadership in Hong Kong. That's critical to make sure that our supply chain efforts in 2012 and beyond really bring great value to the corporation.
And lastly, as I do every year on the February call, I have to talk about the investments the company wants to make in 2012, once again to support its strategic plan. 
Look, SG&A, to me, has 2 really distinct components inside of it. There's a fixed component, which the company needs to spend every single year, and there's a variable component. And the time we spend as a management team is always discussing in advance of a new year where are we going to place our bets, where are we going to invest money, not only to achieve our strategic plan but to get a great return and to drive sales and earnings inside the business. Examples of that were in 2010 where the highlights of that year were about China, at about global online.
Last year, we talked about opening up Italy and expanding our Athleta business. So as we enter 2012, we're going to continue with our international expansion. But what you're going to hear a little differently is that we're going to have a focus on putting some money back into our domestic business in 3 key areas: in product; in marketing; and in e-commerce.
On the product front, like a lot of other people in the industry, we expect to get some tailwinds in our cost of goods in the second half of 2012. So we made some decisions that we're going to make some investments, very targeted, very specific in categories we know we can dominate on where we can get a point of differentiation and really what the focus for me is categories, I believe, are assets of the corporation. So that's been the filter we're using. We want to make sure we get savings from the reduction in costs, but we're going to make some targeted investments and that's really going to benefit our domestic business. So key categories in Banana Republic, Old Navy and in Gap brand is investment we're going to make in 2012. We're going to put some money behind Gap brand marketing. The time is right. We really believe in our team at the Gap Global Creative Center. And we're going to be putting some money behind marketing for the new platform called Be Bright around the world, but a real focus here in North America. I think Art Peck and his team have done a lot of work in 2011 to position them, not only to drive our brand equity but to make sure we're out there telling customers about it week in, week out, month in, month out, season in, season out. That's very important for Gap brand.
And lastly, we're going to put some money as we have, really, the last couple of years but even a stepped-up amount behind our e-commerce business. We opened up a new distribution center in 2011. So we're going to have those costs to carry forward for all of 2012. But the real investment is in mobile. Our mobile platform has done extremely well. We have a lot of new ideas, innovative ideas, coming out from Toby and his team.
And the last area, which is really about global, is we're going to create a brand new, global IT platform. Now when you open up in Italy and China and some of the other plans we have for the business going forward, you have to be strong in IT and you have to be strong in supply chain. It's going to take us a number of years to get done to really create and build a brand new global IT platform. 
So we enter 2012, everybody here at Gap Inc. very focused on what we have to get done. We know what needs to be done and we're very motivated as we come into the year to make sure that we take all of our brands to a new level and perform well domestically and internationally across every brand, every channel and every geography.
So with that said, let me hand it over to Sabrina, who will take you through the financial highlights, and I'm going to come back after that and answer any questions from the analysts. Sabrina?"

I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in",1219,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in our performance.
Throughout the year, we delivered higher average unit retails enabled by our disciplined inventory management. While continuing to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, we tightly managed our operating expenses, which leveraged 30 basis points. We generated $800 million in free cash flow, and finally, we distributed $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the fourth quarter, net earnings were $218 million and earnings per share were $0.44. Full year net earnings were $833 million and full year earnings per share was $1.56, down 17%.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Fourth quarter total sales were $4.3 billion, down 2%. Full year total sales were down 1% to $14.5 billion in comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 4% for the year. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Since Q1 of 2011, we laid out our view that margins would contract significantly during the year, driven by the sharp escalation in average unit costs, especially in the back half. Further, we also said that we would deliver average unit retails up, but not up enough to offset the increase in average unit costs. The year did indeed play out this way. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was down 540 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margins were down 500 basis points, while rent and occupancy deleveraged by 40 basis points. Gross profit was $1.4 billion.
For the full year, gross margin was 36.2%, down 400 basis points. Merchandise margins were down 370 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points. Gross profit for the year was $5.3 billion, down 10%.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. Given the high average unit costs this year, we managed our inventory units down so that our total inventory dollars per store remained reasonable. We're pleased that at the end of the fourth quarter, as indicated on our January sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was about flat.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. Given the decline in our gross margin dollars, we responded to mitigate the impact to earnings by managing our expenses tightly. And even as we continued to invest meaningfully in our international growth initiative, we leveraged Q4 operating expenses by 60 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1 billion. These expenses include $166 million of marketing, up slightly to last year. For the full year, total operating expenses were $3.8 billion, down $85 million from the prior year and leveraged as a percent of sales by 30 basis points. Full year marketing expenses were $548 million, up $32 million to last year.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures. Full year capital expenditures were $548 million, focused on international and the associated IT investments, global online and Old Navy downsizes. In line with our articulated strategy, in North America, we continued to reduce our square footage through closures and consolidations at Gap brand and downsizes at Old Navy. For the year, we closed 65 stores on a net basis and decreased square footage by 1.3 million square feet in North America. Outside of North America, we grew through both company-operated and franchise stores.
On a net basis, we added 33 international company-operated stores and 49 franchise stores. Total Gap Inc. net square footage was down 2.6% compared to last year. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash on Slide 10. We generated strong cash free flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, of $800 million, and we repurchased 111 million shares for $2.1 billion at an average price of $18.88. Our level of share repurchase for the year was higher than usual, enabled by our capital raising in the first quarter of 2011. We ended the year with 485 million shares outstanding.
Now I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect earnings per share for fiscal year 2012, which includes the 53rd week, to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80, and operating margin to be about 10%. Underlying that guidance are the following priorities: improving sales with healthy merchandise margins; investing in our business while maintaining discipline; and returning excess cash to shareholders.
With regard to improving sales and delivering healthy merchandise margins. It's our objective to drive modest top line growth through the stabilization of our base businesses and a continuation of our global growth initiatives, which are focused on our online outlet and franchise channels.
Moving to margins. Clearly, cotton inflation had a significant impact on our average unit costs in 2011. As is commonly known in the sector, spring 2012 costs are up, though up less than holiday 2011. We are fairly confident that average unit costs will improve in the second half of 2012. However, we've just begun to purchase the back half and are still finalizing our assortment and reinvestment decisions. Therefore, some uncertainty exists regarding precisely where costing will land.
Our second priority is investing in our businesses while maintaining discipline. As Glenn discussed, after 5 years of extremely disciplined expense management, coupled with a focus on international growth, we are going to be investing more in our domestic businesses. As a result of that, it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses in 2012.
We'll obviously temper the level of investments depending upon our momentum and our likely returns, and we will update you as we proceed throughout the year. With regard to inventory, we plan to continue to manage inventory units in a disciplined manner and expect inventory dollars per store to be about flat at the end of Q1. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. As I mentioned, our 2011 share repurchases were higher than usual due to our capital raising. In 2012, we expect to return to a more normalized pace of share repurchases. And today, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
In addition, we plan to increase our annual dividend by $0.05 to $0.50 per share, representing a payout of nearly 30% of net earnings.
Please turn to Slide 12 for a summary of the guidance I just provided and some additional full year 2012 metrics. Regarding company-operated stores. Net of repositions, we plan to open about 125 stores and close about 115. Store openings are weighted toward international and outlets, while store closures are weighted toward Gap specialty stores in North America. We expect net square footage to decrease by about 1%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $600 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. And finally, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 39.5%.
In conclusion, as we enter a new year, we're committed to growing earnings per share, while strategically reinvesting in the business. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

And then, what probably wasn't clear in the opening comments, then if you do that, that's part of the driver as to why you're seeing us put a little bit more marketing money in our domestic business because if you're going to do that, we have to go out either through the windows, in store, through social media, through other tools to let people know that we have either done -- made some investments in key categories like suiting up Banana Republic and there's a list of categories we believe in across all our brand. I believe that's going to generate some tension from customers and turn into traffic for our store, such as one area in which we're doing that. In terms of promotional activity, I think that we're always challenging our teams, and last year was not necessarily our best year on this front. We were much better at this in 2010, just finding the innovative, really differentiated marketing, value proposition that bring people into the stores. If you look at something Old Navy started in 2012, was called Super C-A-S-H. I think ideas like that, that Gap can have a version. Banana Republic, Athleta and, of course, course, Old Navy and our outlet stores need always find what's innovative, what's unique, what does a customer really respond to? I think those 2 things in combination should be enough to at least give us an improvement on the traffic trajectory that we were disappointed in in 2011."

What I can say is that, and I could take an exhaustive answer here and go brand by brand, but it was commented at the beginning of the call on product. The change we made in New York City was, that was a seismic shift for us because it really is bringing together the domestic design teams, the international design teams under one full global design team in New York City for Gap. So that team worked for about 10 months together. They worked through processes, and we had to make sure we're all aligned on our global aesthetic and there was work being done. We'd all agreed 2011 was not our best foot forward at Gap. So that work just showed up in the store in February 10, a little later in some of our global markets, but February 10 in North America. Then -- so there's a lot in there that I feel good about. The work from in terms of the talent and bringing together those 2 teams, then the addition of the Creative Advisor role under Tracy. I'm starting to see, at least, and I was in New York just recently, how they're working together, what decisions from a fashion and basic, the balance of the assortment and the decisions those teams are making. I think they're really crystal clear on the aesthetic going forward. The Banana Republic team, they start going through, not the same seismic shift that went on at Gap, but they addressed some of their concerns in Women's and obviously there's some reported number that helped. The Banana Republic team have a 6 comp in January. I believe they've been on top of making the changes they needed to make about 6 months ago. And there's some similar changes going on at Old Navy. So all in all, with the trends in the marketplace, which are really highlighted by a real focus on color and demand of color, given our brands and what the American aesthetically stand for and the work that we've done to actually take corrective measures because we keep saying  internally that anybody can have a good month. We don't want to perform well and above where we've been, which is our commitment based on the fact we're just lucky on a trend.

And the confidence has picked up to a point where some marketing, I want to make sure I'm clear on this, some marketing will go into Q1. The investments I'm talking about will have to be one earned and they'll have to be -- they will happen, and probably if our business performs at a higher rate through the year. So it's driven by -- if you're going to be making some changes in product and get it right on to the customer in which we need to attract to our stores, we got to go tell that story. We have a lot of marketing in the business. I want to make sure I'm clear about that. So this is a Gap story, mostly in domestic, mostly in North America. Old Navy has plenty of marketing. Their issue in 2011 was it wasn't effective, as we said a number of times on these calls, maybe be as transparent as we are. We were not happy with our marketing up until November when the new platform came out. On the sourcing, the team is just being put together now. We were very pleased with our geographical hub structure up until 2011. Could have made the change then to a more category structure versus aligning all the way through our business from design to merchandising through production through sourcing by categories. But given the spike in cotton, we decided to not do at that time because we have enough disruptions going on and enough stress in the business to try to manage our way through that challenge. We're in the early days, Jeff. Let's see. This is the month of February. So the team that's been put in place from a category perspective, their first impact in the business will probably be in our holiday buying, which we haven't even begun just yet. So they'll probably have some impact on holiday. The real benefit to me of the category hub structure, it allows us to build much deeper relationships with mills upstream which we do not have today. That's a missed opportunity in our sourcing. We do the old mills. No words to a degree we will going forward in a category structure gets the category leader relationship with the mills much stronger. And I think some of that benefit that I hope will be materialized could come in holiday, but most of that will be 2013."

I'd say, John, it's difficult to be absolute about this because we have flexibility. Product is the one area we're going to invest in. Again, it's going to be very targeted in key categories that we can dominate in, in selective brands. That's one of the longest lead time. So I would say that one, as I know today, will likely be the most amount of pure dollars will go into that area. But we also -- we've done some tests ahead of time, some categories, to make sure we know we can resonate with customers. It will be noticed and we'll get paid for it. But we'll be watching it through the year to make sure that those -- that, that outcome actually happens. Marketing would be the next one in line, but that has much more flexibility, much shorter lead times. And e-commerce, I talked about the new Phoenix distribution center. We got full op -- open full operation in the fall of 2011. There's some mobile investments we're going to make. There's some investments in people that goes into that business as well, and probably the lesser of the money we're spending as we do every year, as I said at the beginning, we're always -- we're deciding what variable SG&A we want to put in the business to deliver on the strategic plan, but also to hit the framework of the economic model the company needs to have. In terms of what percent were built, here's what they'll tell you. We're at best just finishing our fall buy right now, at best. We haven't even started anything on holiday. We had choices like we have across all of the cost centers in the business. One, negotiate as hard as we can, which is we're going to do regardless, and get savings through the assumption of tailwinds in the back half to put all of that money in the bottom line of the business. But also, we had a choice to pack and go. Where do we believe? We can actually get a win in certain key categories across brands and give our designers and merchandisers a little bit of license to put some more money back into the product. And just one last point on that. When you think a product, to me, it starts with fit, which costs no more money. Just want to have a great fit and consistent fit, then it goes to color. Doesn't cost any more money. You got to have the right color for the season. Then it goes to style, which could be print and pattern as well. It doesn't cost any more money, then it gets to fabric. So our designers and merchants know that in order to have excellent, consistent great product season in, season out, you have to deliver on all 4 of those. All we're trying to highlight today is, there are in some areas, putting some money back into fabric does make strategic sense to us."

There still is uncertainty because as we said, and Glenn just reminded, we just started buying the back half. And there's lots of decisions not only the variables that are macro factors like cotton and labor and all of that, but there's also just our merchants who are making decisions about the mix of the assortment, where they'll reinvest. But all that said, we said we're fairly confident that costing will improve in the back half and our range includes scenarios with improvements. With regard to share repurchase, we also have embedded a range of share repurchases. Now I think it's important that I just underscore, again, we're trying to signal that we are absolutely committed to cash distributions as we have been for many, many years. Nothing in our principal has changed. But definitely, 2012 will be a more normalized, what we consider normalized year share repurchases. And if you look back over the last whatever, 6, 7 years, we sort of averaged $1 billion, $1.3 billion per year. And the timing, obviously, matters about the share repurchases and how accretive they are as they're back half-weighted, front half-weighted, et cetera."

We did get a nice increase in 2011 and we wouldn't expect that same kind of increase in '11 in '12. And the reason is '11 seems to be a really unique year with balances of our customers sort of growing. I guess, that's maybe a sign that people are getting more confident as the economy improves and stabilizes, but the loss rates have stayed pretty low. I think that's fairly unique circumstances.

They come together to formulate a gross margin rate to the senior merchant, but they should be independent decisions, AUC, AIR based on competition and what you want to do by categories. And the AUC piece is just making sure that our sourcing and production teams can get us the best cost and leverage the size of the company. I will say, Paul, that in 2011, given this unique year, particularly in the back half as we spoke about these significant increases in our cost of goods, our teams were much more aware of AUC. Those who had to price AIR, those that who had to make AUR decisions were much more aware of it. Coming in 2012, there's 2 components that are changing based on my opening comments. One, from an assortment perspective, at Old Navy in particular, we felt that we got a little bit off on the spreading of our price points under a good, better, best strategy. Got a little too far up in the best category, and that's going to be managed back to a better balance inside good, better, best. So that's one change that is certainly happening. And then our value businesses, our outlet business and in Old Navy, because of the significant increases that really impacted them in 2011 in the back half. Those are few areas we crossed thresholds with customers, and those adjustments are going to have to be made. And we're going to go back to how we operate the business in 2010, which is really making sure that merchants are 100% focused on the value proposition in the business, and then the production team getting the best cost possible, but not having the relationship be so directly affected one to the other as we did in the back half of '11 given the huge increases."

And the market leaders on price will be dictating a lot of this and the people who control the floor will be sending signals through everybody, whether they believe the price levels and whatever inflation was allowed to come through in 2011 should sustain itself in 2012.

So before we get to that, I",1884,"Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. In a few minutes, I'll hand the conference call over to Sabrina, who'll take you through 2011 highlights and also talk to you about our guidance and some key metrics for 2012. So before we get to that, I want to take you through a couple of thoughts I had on this past year and also talk to you about where I see 2012 in terms of the company's strategic plan and what investments we see ourselves making in the upcoming year. In spite of 2011 earnings being below last year, we actually did make quite a bit of progress against our strategic plan. So we have 2 key initiatives that Gap Inc. has been pursuing for the last 4 years that make up our strategic plan.
The first key initiative is to reduce our dependency on our North American specialty bricks and mortar business. So we did accomplish quite a bit on that front in 2011. First off, we grew our online business of penetration to our total sales by 2 percentage points. The second thing we did is we reduced our specialty square footage by over 4%, while at the same time growing our outlet square footage domestically by 4%. We closed 65 stores domestically and we opened up 8 Athleta stores, very successful, I may add, and that makes us feel very good about our future for 2012 and beyond.
The second area which we made quite a bit of progress is our move to expand our brands internationally. At the beginning of the year, we operate in 31 countries, combination of franchised and company-owned stores, and we ended 2011 by operating in 39 countries. In China, we opened 10 stores. We finished the year with 14 stores and feel very good about the progress we're making in China, particularly in Hong Kong. And in 2012, we have a plan right now to open 30 stores. Franchise business, where we opened 50 stores and good performance were seen in our franchise business and we grew total year 2011 at greater than 40%, and we see an opportunity to open at least 50 stores in 2012. We added global outlet into Italy, in Japan, in the U.K. and we'll be taking our global outlet business to China in the fall of 2012.
And lastly, Banana Republic opened up in Paris, in the Champs-Élysées, and a beautiful store and that will be the beginning of Banana Republic expanding into France. As we come into 2012, our goal clearly is to advance our strategic plan in this fiscal year, while at the same time improving our sales and earnings profile of the corporation. 
So in order to ensure success, one of my key mandates through 2011 was to make sure the business took appropriate corrective measures in some key areas to make sure we can deliver on that latter goal of improving our sales and earnings profile in 2012.
So there's 4 areas that we've been focused on in the last fiscal year: product; our assortment; our marketing; and our supply chain. So let me first talk about product. Probably the biggest change we made throughout the year in 2011 was the creation of the Gap Global Creative Center in New York City. That was the bringing together, from a domestic and international perspective, design, marketing and production to create one amazing hub of creativity at New York City for all of our stores around the world. Really, the first output from that team just showed up in our stores globally 2 weeks ago. I really like the progress I've seen that's come out under Pam Wallack's leadership in New York. The other changes have been quite a bit of investment in people, to make through the year and continue to make going forward. The first one that came out was the creation of this Creative Advisor role. Tracy Gardner joined us about 4 weeks ago. We just announced that Jill Stanton will be Creative Advisor at Old Navy. Jill has an amazing background in Next, Marks & Spencer and Nike globally.
This is a new role, but it's critical to me to get to consistent product execution. One of the conclusions we came to through the year is we need to add this role to work with our designers and create a nice bridge between the design teams and the merchandising teams. So really quite a bit of development along product. With everything we're doing, the goal is clear here. We need to have consistent product execution every quarter, every year across all our brands.
We focused on assortment at the latter part of 2011, and probably driven by the spike in cotton pricing in value businesses. We got a little off balance between basics and fashion and also we got a little bit off between our opening price point product and our best product. Those changes have been made, and Old Navy's assortment will be much better balanced between the areas I talked about coming into April and May.
Marketing was quite a bit of work in 2011. I'm really excited. If I look at all of our brands, we are either starting the year with a brand new marketing platform or a modified platform in order to make sure we get a great return for our marketing and really drive brand equity and traffic. So Old Navy, we modified the Funnovations Inc. platform that we introduced in November, and the real modification is make sure the product shows up better. I mean, it's a great platform. It's so Old Navy, but the product doesn't show up as well as it should. Those modifications are being made.
Brand new platform at Gap, came out 2 weeks ago, Be Bright. It's a global campaign and we really think we have a great idea. Banana Republic, you'll see in the marketing that came out this spring, a real focus on what we're calling internally new work. The marketing is about that. It's showing up in the windows. It's showing up in store. How does Banana Republic, as it did a decade ago, redefine what work is. And Athleta came out with a brand new platform called Power to the She. Very appropriate for the Athleta business as we add, from our 10 stores we currently have and add 25 new stores in 2012. The campaign is going to be so important for that.
And lastly, we made some adjustments to our supply chain. We brought our distribution and logistics team together and merged it with our sourcing team to create one supply chain team, lead by Colin Funnell, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain. Same time, we also changed how we go to market. For years, we've had a geographically based hub structure and we moved to category teams and we've added a lot of new talent. New leadership in India, new leadership in Hong Kong. That's critical to make sure that our supply chain efforts in 2012 and beyond really bring great value to the corporation.
And lastly, as I do every year on the February call, I have to talk about the investments the company wants to make in 2012, once again to support its strategic plan. 
Look, SG&A, to me, has 2 really distinct components inside of it. There's a fixed component, which the company needs to spend every single year, and there's a variable component. And the time we spend as a management team is always discussing in advance of a new year where are we going to place our bets, where are we going to invest money, not only to achieve our strategic plan but to get a great return and to drive sales and earnings inside the business. Examples of that were in 2010 where the highlights of that year were about China, at about global online.
Last year, we talked about opening up Italy and expanding our Athleta business. So as we enter 2012, we're going to continue with our international expansion. But what you're going to hear a little differently is that we're going to have a focus on putting some money back into our domestic business in 3 key areas: in product; in marketing; and in e-commerce.
On the product front, like a lot of other people in the industry, we expect to get some tailwinds in our cost of goods in the second half of 2012. So we made some decisions that we're going to make some investments, very targeted, very specific in categories we know we can dominate on, where we can get a point of differentiation and really the focus for me is categories, I believe, are assets of the corporation. So that's been the filter we're using. We want to make sure we get savings from the reduction in costs, but we're going to make some targeted investments and that's really going to benefit our domestic business. So key categories in Banana Republic, Old Navy and in Gap brand is investment we're going to make in 2012. We're going to put some money behind Gap brand marketing. The time is right. We really believe in our team at the Gap Global Creative Center. And we're going to be putting some money behind marketing for the new platform called Be Bright around the world, but a real focus here in North America. I think Art Peck and his team have done a lot of work in 2011 to position them, not only to drive our brand equity but to make sure we're out there telling customers about it week in, week out, month in, month out, season in, season out. That's very important for Gap brand.
And lastly, we're going to put some money as we have, really, the last couple of years but even a stepped-up amount behind our e-commerce business. We opened up a new distribution center in 2011. So we're going to have those costs to carry forward for all of 2012. But the real investment is in mobile. Our mobile platform has done extremely well. We have a lot of new ideas, innovative ideas, coming out from Toby and his team.
And the last area, which is really about global, is we're going to create a brand new, global IT platform. Now when you open up in Italy and China and some of the other plans we have for the business going forward, you have to be strong in IT and you have to be strong in supply chain. It's going to take us a number of years to get done to really create and build a brand new global IT platform. 
So we enter 2012, everybody here at Gap Inc. very focused on what we have to get done. We know what needs to be done and we're very motivated as we come into the year to make sure that we take all of our brands to a new level and perform well domestically and internationally across every brand, every channel and every geography.
So with that said, let me hand it over to Sabrina, who will take you through the financial highlights, and I'm going to come back after that and answer any questions from the analysts. Sabrina?"

I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in",1219,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in our performance.
Throughout the year, we delivered higher average unit retails enabled by our disciplined inventory management. While continuing to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, we tightly managed our operating expenses, which leveraged 30 basis points. We generated $800 million in free cash flow, and finally, we distributed $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the fourth quarter, net earnings were $218 million and earnings per share were $0.44. Full year net earnings were $833 million and full year earnings per share was $1.56, down 17%.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Fourth quarter total sales were $4.3 billion, down 2%. Full year total sales were down 1% to $14.5 billion in comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 4% for the year. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Since Q1 of 2011, we laid out our view that margins would contract significantly during the year, driven by the sharp escalation in average unit costs, especially in the back half. Further, we also said that we would deliver average unit retails up, but not up enough to offset the increase in average unit costs. The year did indeed play out this way. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was down 540 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margins were down 500 basis points, while rent and occupancy deleveraged by 40 basis points. Gross profit was $1.4 billion.
For the full year, gross margin was 36.2%, down 400 basis points. Merchandise margins were down 370 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points. Gross profit for the year was $5.3 billion, down 10%.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. Given the high average unit costs this year, we managed our inventory units down, so that our total inventory dollars per store remained reasonable. We're pleased that at the end of the fourth quarter, as indicated on our January sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was about flat.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. Given the decline in our gross margin dollars, we responded to mitigate the impact to earnings by managing our expenses tightly. And even as we continued to invest meaningfully in our international growth initiative, we leveraged Q4 operating expenses by 60 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1 billion. These expenses include $166 million of marketing, up slightly to last year. For the full year, total operating expenses were $3.8 billion, down $85 million from the prior year and leveraged as a percent of sales by 30 basis points. Full year marketing expenses were $548 million, up $32 million to last year.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures. Full year capital expenditures were $548 million, focused on international and the associated IT investments, global online and Old Navy downsizes. In line with our articulated strategy, in North America, we continued to reduce our square footage through closures and consolidations at Gap brand and downsizes at Old Navy. For the year, we closed 65 stores on a net basis and decreased square footage by 1.3 million square feet in North America. Outside of North America, we grew through both company-operated and franchise stores.
On a net basis, we added 33 international company-operated stores and 49 franchise stores. Total Gap Inc. net square footage was down 2.6% compared to last year. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash on Slide 10. We generated strong free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, of $800 million, and we repurchased 111 million shares for $2.1 billion at an average price of $18.88. Our level of share repurchase for the year was higher than usual, enabled by our capital raising in the first quarter of 2011. We ended the year with 485 million shares outstanding.
Now I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect earnings per share for fiscal year 2012, which includes the 53rd week, to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80, and operating margin to be about 10%. Underlying that guidance are the following priorities: improving sales with healthy merchandise margins; investing in our business while maintaining discipline; and returning excess cash to shareholders.
With regard to improving sales and delivering healthy merchandise margins. It's our objective to drive modest top line growth through the stabilization of our base businesses and a continuation of our global growth initiatives, which are focused on our online outlet and franchise channels.
Moving to margins. Clearly, cotton inflation had a significant impact on our average unit costs in 2011. As is commonly known in the sector, spring 2012 costs are up, though up less than holiday 2011. We are fairly confident that average unit costs will improve in the second half of 2012. However, we've just begun to purchase the back half and are still finalizing our assortment and reinvestment decisions. Therefore, some uncertainty exists regarding precisely where costing will land.
Our second priority is investing in our businesses while maintaining discipline. As Glenn discussed, after 5 years of extremely disciplined expense management, coupled with a focus on international growth, we are going to be investing more in our domestic businesses. As a result of that, it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses in 2012.
We'll obviously temper the level of investments depending upon our momentum and our likely returns, and we will update you as we proceed throughout the year. With regard to inventory, we plan to continue to manage inventory units in a disciplined manner and expect inventory dollars per store to be about flat at the end of Q1. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. As I mentioned, our 2011 share repurchases were higher than usual due to our capital raising. In 2012, we expect to return to a more normalized pace of share repurchases. And today, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
In addition, we plan to increase our annual dividend by $0.05 to $0.50 per share, representing a payout of nearly 30% of net earnings.
Please turn to Slide 12 for a summary of the guidance I just provided and some additional full year 2012 metrics. Regarding company-operated stores. Net of repositions, we plan to open about 125 stores and close about 115. Store openings are weighted toward international and outlets, while store closures are weighted toward Gap specialty stores in North America. We expect net square footage to decrease by about 1%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $600 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. And finally, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 39.5%.
In conclusion, as we enter a new year, we're committed to growing earnings per share, while strategically reinvesting in the business. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

And then, what probably wasn't clear in the opening comments, then if you do that, that's part of the driver as to why you're seeing us put a little bit more marketing money in our domestic business because if you're going to do that, we have to go out either through the windows, in store, through social media, through other tools to let people know that we have either done -- made some investments in key categories like suiting up Banana Republic and there's a list of categories we believe in across all our brands. I believe that's going to generate some attention from customers and turn into traffic for our stores, such as one area in which we're doing that. In terms of promotional activity, I think that we're always challenging our teams, and last year was not necessarily our best year on this front. We were much better at this in 2010, just finding the innovative, really differentiated marketing, value proposition to bring people into the stores. If you look at something Old Navy started in 2012, was called Super C-A-S-H. I think ideas like that, that Gap can have a version. Banana Republic, Athleta and, of course, Old Navy and our outlet stores need to always find what's innovative, what's unique, what does a customer really respond to? I think those 2 things in combination should be enough to at least give us an improvement on the traffic trajectory that we were disappointed in, in 2011."

That takes a while and there's tools out there. We've actually developed our own proprietary tools in some cases to be able to speak to people directly and not just rely on broadcast media.

What I can say is that, and I could take an exhaustive answer here and go brand by brand, but it was commented at the beginning of the call on product. The change we made in New York City was, that was a seismic shift for us because it really is bringing together the domestic design teams, the international design teams under one full global design team in New York City for Gap. So that team worked for about 10 months together. They worked through processes, and we had to make sure we're all aligned on our global aesthetic and there was work being done. We'd all agreed 2011 was not our best foot forward at Gap. So that work just showed up in the store on February 10, a little later in some of our global markets, but February 10 in North America. Then -- so there's a lot in there that I feel good about. The work from, in terms of the talent and bringing together those 2 teams, then the addition of the Creative Advisor role under Tracy. I'm starting to see, at least, and I was in New York just recently, how they're working together, what decisions from a fashion and basic, the balance of the assortment and the decisions those teams are making. I think they're really crystal clear on the aesthetic going forward. The Banana Republic team, they start going through, not the same seismic shift that went on at Gap, but they addressed some of their concerns in Women's and obviously because there's a reported number that helped. The Banana Republic team have a 6 comp in January. I believe they've been on top of making the changes they needed to make about 6 months ago. And there's some similar changes going on at Old Navy. So all in all, with the trends in the marketplace, which are really highlighted by a real focus on color and demand of color, given our brands and what, the American aesthetic they stand for and the work that we've done to actually take corrective measures because we keep saying internally that anybody can have a good month. We don't want to perform well and above where we've been, which is our commitment, based on the fact we're just lucky on a trend. We want to actually make changes in the business that affect our business performance."

And is it actually in keeping with where you look at your competitive set or will your customers actually notice it and most importantly, will they pay for it?"

Opened in Hong Kong in November, was a -- it's been a very successful opening for us. Opened in 2 other cities, Tianjin and Hangzhou, so now we're in 5 cities in China, 5 more cities to happen. So we'll close 2012 with 10 cities, which we're going to operate, and in also feel very good. The Japanese businesses is difficult for us to gauge given the incredible disaster they faced in 3/11 last year, and we have a big business in Japan. I'll have a better sense of that coming into later in the spring and in the summer. But I like what the team is doing. I think -- I happen to know the work being done in the Gap Global Creative Center is resonating well with the Japanese team. Some of the product has not got to our customer yet, but our team likes what they're seeing. Our Banana Republic business is going to probably expand by a few stores in 2012. That's been on hold for a few years. I think that's good news, and we'll open up Old Navy Japan on July 15, just outside of Tokyo. That leaves us with Europe. And our European business, like a lot of other companies, was soft in 2011. The team there is very aware of it. We have a small business in Italy. So really, what we're talking about for us is France and the U.K. Austerity measures were tough, but we just were not good enough in 2011. The product globally at Gap women's that hurt our overall global Gap business, particularly hit our business in Europe hard, did not register at all with the customers. Again, women's product in the European markets which we operate. So too soon to tell. That's going to be a tough market. That's a wait-and-see for us. We're going to be very careful on capital, be very careful on our investments. We still believe in Europe, but we're going to be watching it quite closely the next 12 months."

And that's really on track with what we laid out back in October to get to 17.5 in '13. With regard to Gap specialty, same, right on track. We said we wanted to get to 700 stores by 2013. We'll be closing about 85 stores in North America specialty in '12, get us down to about 750. And at the same time, important other side of the strategy is to grow the Gap outlets in North America.

We've worked very hard, as we should have, given our performance in 2011. Worked really hard on the product front in getting clarity in each one of our design teams, whether that's addition of talent or was just a better focus, and part of that was the GC, the Gap Global Creative Center in New York City. And the confidence has picked up to the point where some marketing, I want to make sure I'm clear on this, some marketing will go in the Q1. The investments I'm talking about will have to be one earned and they'll have to be -- they will happen, and probably if our business performs at a higher rate through the year. So it's driven by -- if you're going to be making some changes in product and get it right on to the customer in which we need to attract to our stores, we got to go tell that story. We have a lot of marketing in the business. I want to make sure I'm clear about that. So this is a Gap story, mostly in domestic, mostly in North America. Old Navy has plenty of marketing. Their issue in 2011 was it wasn't effective, as we said a number of times on these calls, maybe being as transparent as we are. We were not happy with our marketing up until November when the new platform came out. On the sourcing, the team is just being put together now. We were very pleased with our geographical hub structure up until 2011. Could have made the change then to a more category structure which is aligning all the way through our business from design to merchandising to production to sourcing by categories. But given the spike in cotton, we decided to not do it at that time because we have enough disruptions going on and enough stress in the business to try to manage our way through that challenge. We're in the early days, Jeff. Let's see. This is the month of February. So the team that's been put in place from a category perspective, their first impact in the business will probably be in our holiday buying, which we haven't even begun just yet. So they'll probably have some impact on holiday. The real benefit to me of the category hub structure, it allows us to build much deeper relationships with mills upstream which we do not have today. That's a missed opportunity in our sourcing. We do deal with mills. Nowhere to the degree we will going forward, and a category structure gets the category leader relationship with the mills much stronger. And I think some of that benefit that I hope will be materialized could come in holiday, but most of that will be 2013."

I'd say, John, it's difficult to be absolute about this because we have flexibility. Product is the one area we're going to invest in. Again, it's going to be very targeted in key categories that we can dominate in, in selective brands. That's the one with the longest lead time. So I would say that one, as I know today, will likely be the most amount of pure dollars will go into that area. But we also -- we've done some tests ahead of time, some categories, to make sure we know we can resonate with customers. It will be noticed and we'll get paid for it. But we'll be watching it through the year to make sure that those -- that, that outcome actually happens. Marketing would be the next one in line, but that has much more flexibility, much shorter lead times. And e-commerce, I talked about the new Phoenix distribution center. We got full op -- open in full operation in the fall of 2011. There's some mobile investments we're going to make. There's some investments in people that goes into that business as well, and probably the lesser of the money we're spending, as we do every year, as I said at the beginning, we're always -- we're deciding what variable SG&A we want to put in the business to deliver on the strategic plan, but also to hit the framework of the economic model the company needs to have. In terms of what percent were built, here's what they'll tell you. We're at best just finishing our fall buy right now, at best. We haven't even started anything on holiday. We had choices like we have across all of the cost centers in the business. One, negotiate as hard as we can, which is we're going to do regardless, and get savings through the assumption of tailwinds in the back half to put all of that money in the bottom line of the business. But also, we had a choice to pack and go. Where do we believe? We can actually get a win in certain key categories across brands and give our designers and merchandisers a little bit of license to put some more money back into the product. And just one last point on that. When you think a product, to me, it starts with fit, which costs no more money. Just want to have a great fit and consistent fit, then it goes to color. Doesn't cost any more money. You got to have the right color for the season. Then it goes to style, which could be print and pattern as well. It doesn't cost any more money, then it gets to fabric. So our designers and merchants know that in order to have excellent, consistent great product season in, season out, you have to deliver on all 4 of those. All we're trying to highlight today is, there are in some areas, putting some money back into fabric does make strategic sense to us."

Now I think it's important that I just underscore, again, we're trying to signal that we are absolutely committed to cash distributions as we have been for many, many years. Nothing in our principal has changed. But definitely, 2012 will be a more normalized, what we consider normalized year share repurchases. And if you look back over the last whatever, 6, 7 years, we sort of averaged $1 billion, $1.3 billion per year. And the timing, obviously, matters about the share repurchases and how accretive they are as they're back half-weighted, front half-weighted, et cetera."

We've never given specific numbers, but we do embed in our 10-Qs some qualitative flavor that is helpful to our expense management. We did get a nice increase in 2011 and we wouldn't expect that same kind of increase in '11, in '12. And the reason is '11 seems to be a really unique year with balances of our customers sort of growing. I guess, that's maybe a sign that people are getting more confident as the economy improves and stabilizes, but the loss rates have stayed pretty low. I think that's fairly unique circumstances. So we're not counting on the same level of growth in the program in '12 as we got in '11."

They come together to formulate a gross margin rate to the senior merchant, but they should be independent decisions, AUC, AIR based on competition and what you want to do by categories. And the AUC piece is just making sure that our sourcing and production teams can get us the best cost and leverage the size of the company. I will say, Paul, that in 2011, given this unique year, particularly in the back half as we spoke about these significant increases in our cost of goods, our teams were much more aware of AUC. Those who had to price AIR, those that who had to make AUR decisions were much more aware of it. Coming in 2012, there's 2 components that are changing based on my opening comments. One, from an assortment perspective, at Old Navy in particular, we felt that we got a little bit off on the spreading of our price points under a good, better, best strategy. Got a little too far up in the best category, and that's going to be managed back to a better balance inside good, better, best. So that's one change that is certainly happening. And then our value businesses, our outlet business and in Old Navy, because of the significant increases that really impacted them in 2011 in the back half. There's a few areas we crossed thresholds with customers, and those adjustments are going to have to be made. And we're going to go back to how we operate the business in 2010, which is really making sure that merchants are 100% focused on the value proposition in the business, and then the production team getting the best cost possible, but not having the relationship be so directly affected one to the other as we did in the back half of '11 given the huge increases."

We try to hold our product as best as we could. Ours is just strategically trying to put in the key categories. There's going to be a group like that. I'll remind everybody this is category that's had very little inflation for the better part of 20 years. That's the first time we've seen some inflation. And the market leaders on price will be dictating a lot of this and the people who control the floor will be sending signals through everybody, whether they believe the price levels and whatever inflation was allowed to come through in 2011 should sustain itself in 2012.

In a few minutes, I'll hand the conference call over to Sabrina, who'll take you through 2011 highlights and also talk to you about our guidance and some key metrics for 2012. So before we get to that, I want to take you through a couple of thoughts I had on this past year and also talk to you about where I see 2012 in terms of the company's strategic plan and what investments we see ourselves making in the upcoming year. In spite of 2011 earnings being below last year, we actually did make quite a bit of progress against our strategic plan. So we have 2 key initiatives that Gap Inc. has been pursuing for the last 4 years that make up our strategic plan.
The first key initiative is to reduce our dependency on our North American specialty bricks and mortar business. So we did accomplish quite a bit on that front in 2011. First off, we grew our online business of penetration to our total sales by 2 percentage points. The second thing we did is we reduced our specialty square footage by over 4%, while at the same time growing our outlet square footage domestically by 4%. We closed 65 stores domestically and we opened up 8 Athleta stores, very successful, I may add, and that makes us feel very good about our future for 2012 and beyond.
The second area which we made quite a bit of progress is our move to expand our brands internationally. At the beginning of the year, we operate in 31 countries, combination of franchised and company-owned stores, and we ended 2011 by operating in 39 countries. In China, we opened 10 stores. We finished the year with 14 stores and feel very good about the progress we're making in China, particularly in Hong Kong. And in 2012, we have a plan right now to open 30 stores. Franchise business, where we opened 50 stores and good performance were seen in our franchise business and we grew total year 2011 at greater than 40%, and we see an opportunity to open at least 50 stores in 2012. We added global outlet into Italy, in Japan, in the U.K. and we'll be taking our global outlet business to China in the fall of 2012.
And lastly, Banana Republic opened up in Paris, in the Champs-Élysées, and a beautiful store and that will be the beginning of Banana Republic expanding into France. As we come into 2012, our goal clearly is to advance our strategic plan in this fiscal year, while at the same time improving our sales and earnings profile of the corporation. 
So in order to ensure success, one of my key mandates through 2011 was to make sure the business took appropriate corrective measures in some key areas to make sure we can deliver on that latter goal of improving our sales and earnings profile in 2012.
So there's 4 areas that we've been focused on in the last fiscal year: product; our assortment; our marketing; and our supply chain. So let me first talk about product. Probably the biggest change we made throughout the year in 2011 was the creation of the Gap Global Creative Center in New York City. That was the bringing together, from a domestic and international perspective, design, marketing and production to create one amazing hub of creativity at New York City for all of our stores around the world. Really, the first output from that team just showed up in our stores globally 2 weeks ago. I really like the progress I've seen that's come out under Pam Wallack's leadership in New York. The other changes have been quite a bit of investment in people, to make through the year and continue to make going forward. The first one that came out was the creation of this Creative Advisor role. Tracy Gardner joined us about 4 weeks ago. We just announced that Jill Stanton will be Creative Advisor at Old Navy. Jill has an amazing background in Next, Marks & Spencer and Nike globally.
This is a new role, but it's critical to me to get to consistent product execution. One of the conclusions we came to through the year is we need to add this role to work with our designers and create a nice bridge between the design teams and the merchandising teams. So really quite a bit of development along product. With everything we're doing, the goal is clear here. We need to have consistent product execution every quarter, every year across all our brands.
We focused on assortment at the latter part of 2011, and probably driven by the spike in cotton pricing in value businesses. We got a little off balance between basics and fashion and also we got a little bit off between our opening price point product and our best product. Those changes have been made, and Old Navy's assortment will be much better balanced between the areas I talked about coming into April and May.
Marketing was quite a bit of work in 2011. I'm really excited. If I look at all of our brands, we are either starting the year with a brand new marketing platform or a modified platform in order to make sure we get a great return for our marketing and really drive brand equity and traffic. So Old Navy, we modified the Funnovations Inc. platform that we introduced in November, and the real modification is make sure the product shows up better. I mean, it's a great platform. It's so Old Navy, but the product doesn't show up as well as it should. Those modifications are being made.
Brand new platform at Gap, came out 2 weeks ago, Be Bright. It's a global campaign and we really think we have a great idea. Banana Republic, you'll see in the marketing that came out this spring, a real focus on what we're calling internally new work. The marketing is about that. It's showing up in the windows. It's showing up in store. How does Banana Republic, as it did a decade ago, redefine what work is. And Athleta came out with a brand new platform called Power to the She. Very appropriate for the Athleta business as we add, from our 10 stores we currently have and add 25 new stores in 2012. The campaign is going to be so important for that.
And lastly, we made some adjustments to our supply chain. We brought our distribution and logistics team together and merged it with our sourcing team to create one supply chain team, lead by Colin Funnell, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain. Same time, we also changed how we go to market. For years, we've had a geographically based hub structure and we moved to category teams and we've added a lot of new talent. New leadership in India, new leadership in Hong Kong. That's critical to make sure that our supply chain efforts in 2012 and beyond really bring great value to the corporation.
And lastly, as I do every year on the February call, I have to talk about the investments the company wants to make in 2012, once again to support its strategic plan. 
Look, SG&A, to me, has 2 really distinct components inside of it. There's a fixed component, which the company needs to spend every single year, and there's a variable component. And the time we spend as a management team is always discussing in advance of a new year where are we going to place our bets, where are we going to invest money, not only to achieve our strategic plan but to get a great return and to drive sales and earnings inside the business. Examples of that were in 2010 where the highlights of that year were about China, at about global online.
Last year, we talked about opening up Italy and expanding our Athleta business. So as we enter 2012, we're going to continue with our international expansion. But what you're going to hear a little differently is that we're going to have a focus on putting some money back into our domestic business in 3 key areas: in product; in marketing; and in e-commerce.
On the product front, like a lot of other people in the industry, we expect to get some tailwinds in our cost of goods in the second half of 2012. So we made some decisions that we're going to make some investments, very targeted, very specific in categories we know we can dominate on, where we can get a point of differentiation and really the focus for me is categories, I believe, are assets of the corporation. So that's been the filter we're using. We want to make sure we get savings from the reduction in costs, but we're going to make some targeted investments and that's really going to benefit our domestic business. So key categories in Banana Republic, Old Navy and in Gap brand is investment we're going to make in 2012. We're going to put some money behind Gap brand marketing. The time is right. We really believe in our team at the Gap Global Creative Center. And we're going to be putting some money behind marketing for the new platform called Be Bright around the world, but a real focus here in North America. I think Art Peck and his team have done a lot of work in 2011 to position them, not only to drive our brand equity but to make sure we're out there telling customers about it week in, week out, month in, month out, season in, season out. That's very important for Gap brand.
And lastly, we're going to put some money as we have, really, the last couple of years but even a stepped-up amount behind our e-commerce business. We opened up a new distribution center in 2011. So we're going to have those costs to carry forward for all of 2012. But the real investment is in mobile. Our mobile platform has done extremely well. We have a lot of new ideas, innovative ideas, coming out from Toby and his team.
And the last area, which is really about global, is we're going to create a brand new, global IT platform. Now when you open up in Italy and China and some of the other plans we have for the business going forward, you have to be strong in IT and you have to be strong in supply chain. It's going to take us a number of years to get done to really create and build a brand new global IT platform. 
So we enter 2012, everybody here at Gap Inc. very focused on what we have to get done. We know what needs to be done and we're very motivated as we come into the year to make sure that we take all of our brands to a new level and perform well domestically and internationally across every brand, every channel and every geography.
So with that said, let me hand it over to Sabrina, who will take you through the financial highlights, and I'm going to come back after that and answer any questions from the analysts. Sabrina?"

I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in",1219,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2012. Although 2011 was a challenging year, it's worth pointing out some bright spots in our performance.
Throughout the year, we delivered higher average unit retails enabled by our disciplined inventory management. While continuing to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, we tightly managed our operating expenses, which leveraged 30 basis points. We generated $800 million in free cash flow, and finally, we distributed $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the fourth quarter, net earnings were $218 million and earnings per share were $0.44. Full year net earnings were $833 million and full year earnings per share was $1.56, down 17%.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Fourth quarter total sales were $4.3 billion, down 2%. Full year total sales were down 1% to $14.5 billion in comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 4% for the year. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Since Q1 of 2011, we laid out our view that margins would contract significantly during the year, driven by the sharp escalation in average unit costs, especially in the back half. Further, we also said that we would deliver average unit retails up, but not up enough to offset the increase in average unit costs. The year did indeed play out this way. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was down 540 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margins were down 500 basis points, while rent and occupancy deleveraged by 40 basis points. Gross profit was $1.4 billion.
For the full year, gross margin was 36.2%, down 400 basis points. Merchandise margins were down 370 basis points, and rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points. Gross profit for the year was $5.3 billion, down 10%.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. Given the high average unit costs this year, we managed our inventory units down, so that our total inventory dollars per store remained reasonable. We're pleased that at the end of the fourth quarter, as indicated on our January sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was about flat.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. Given the decline in our gross margin dollars, we responded to mitigate the impact to earnings by managing our expenses tightly. And even as we continued to invest meaningfully in our international growth initiative, we leveraged Q4 operating expenses by 60 basis points.
For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1 billion. These expenses include $166 million of marketing, up slightly to last year. For the full year, total operating expenses were $3.8 billion, down $85 million from the prior year and leveraged as a percent of sales by 30 basis points. Full year marketing expenses were $548 million, up $32 million to last year.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures. Full year capital expenditures were $548 million, focused on international and the associated IT investments, global online and Old Navy downsizes. In line with our articulated strategy, in North America, we continued to reduce our square footage through closures and consolidations at Gap brand and downsizes at Old Navy. For the year, we closed 65 stores on a net basis and decreased square footage by 1.3 million square feet in North America. Outside of North America, we grew through both company-operated and franchise stores.
On a net basis, we added 33 international company-operated stores and 49 franchise stores. Total Gap Inc. net square footage was down 2.6% compared to last year. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash on Slide 10. We generated strong free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, of $800 million, and we repurchased 111 million shares for $2.1 billion at an average price of $18.88. Our level of share repurchase for the year was higher than usual, enabled by our capital raising in the first quarter of 2011. We ended the year with 485 million shares outstanding.
Now I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect earnings per share for fiscal year 2012, which includes the 53rd week, to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80, and operating margin to be about 10%. Underlying that guidance are the following priorities: improving sales with healthy merchandise margins; investing in our business while maintaining discipline; and returning excess cash to shareholders.
With regard to improving sales and delivering healthy merchandise margins. It's our objective to drive modest top line growth through the stabilization of our base businesses and a continuation of our global growth initiatives, which are focused on our online outlet and franchise channels.
Moving to margins. Clearly, cotton inflation had a significant impact on our average unit costs in 2011. As is commonly known in the sector, spring 2012 costs are up, though up less than holiday 2011. We are fairly confident that average unit costs will improve in the second half of 2012. However, we've just begun to purchase the back half and are still finalizing our assortment and reinvestment decisions. Therefore, some uncertainty exists regarding precisely where costing will land.
Our second priority is investing in our businesses while maintaining discipline. As Glenn discussed, after 5 years of extremely disciplined expense management, coupled with a focus on international growth, we are going to be investing more in our domestic businesses. As a result of that, it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses in 2012.
We'll obviously temper the level of investments depending upon our momentum and our likely returns, and we will update you as we proceed throughout the year. With regard to inventory, we plan to continue to manage inventory units in a disciplined manner and expect inventory dollars per store to be about flat at the end of Q1. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. As I mentioned, our 2011 share repurchases were higher than usual due to our capital raising. In 2012, we expect to return to a more normalized pace of share repurchases. And today, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
In addition, we plan to increase our annual dividend by $0.05 to $0.50 per share, representing a payout of nearly 30% of net earnings.
Please turn to Slide 12 for a summary of the guidance I just provided and some additional full year 2012 metrics. Regarding company-operated stores. Net of repositions, we plan to open about 125 stores and close about 115. Store openings are weighted toward international and outlets, while store closures are weighted toward Gap specialty stores in North America. We expect net square footage to decrease by about 1%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $600 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. And finally, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 39.5%.
In conclusion, as we enter a new year, we're committed to growing earnings per share, while strategically reinvesting in the business. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

And then, what probably wasn't clear in the opening comments, then if you do that, that's part of the driver as to why you're seeing us put a little bit more marketing money in our domestic business because if you're going to do that, we have to go out either through the windows, in store, through social media, through other tools to let people know that we have either done -- made some investments in key categories like suiting up Banana Republic and there's a list of categories we believe in across all our brands. I believe that's going to generate some attention from customers and turn into traffic for our stores, such as one area in which we're doing that. In terms of promotional activity, I think that we're always challenging our teams, and last year was not necessarily our best year on this front. We were much better at this in 2010, just finding the innovative, really differentiated marketing, value proposition to bring people into the stores. If you look at something Old Navy started in 2012, was called Super C-A-S-H. I think ideas like that, that Gap can have a version. Banana Republic, Athleta and, of course, Old Navy and our outlet stores need to always find what's innovative, what's unique, what does a customer really respond to? I think those 2 things in combination should be enough to at least give us an improvement on the traffic trajectory that we were disappointed in, in 2011."

What I can say is that, and I could take an exhaustive answer here and go brand by brand, but it was commented at the beginning of the call on product. The change we made in New York City was, that was a seismic shift for us because it really is bringing together the domestic design teams, the international design teams under one full global design team in New York City for Gap. So that team worked for about 10 months together. They worked through processes, and we had to make sure we're all aligned on our global aesthetic and there was work being done. We'd all agreed 2011 was not our best foot forward at Gap. So that work just showed up in the store on February 10, a little later in some of our global markets, but February 10 in North America. Then -- so there's a lot in there that I feel good about. The work from, in terms of the talent and bringing together those 2 teams, then the addition of the Creative Advisor role under Tracy. I'm starting to see, at least, and I was in New York just recently, how they're working together, what decisions from a fashion and basic, the balance of the assortment and the decisions those teams are making. I think they're really crystal clear on the aesthetic going forward. The Banana Republic team, they start going through, not the same seismic shift that went on at Gap, but they addressed some of their concerns in Women's and obviously because there's a reported number that helped. The Banana Republic team have a 6 comp in January. I believe they've been on top of making the changes they needed to make about 6 months ago. And there's some similar changes going on at Old Navy. So all in all, with the trends in the marketplace, which are really highlighted by a real focus on color and demand of color, given our brands and what, the American aesthetic they stand for and the work that we've done to actually take corrective measures because we keep saying internally that anybody can have a good month. We don't want to perform well and above where we've been, which is our commitment, based on the fact we're just lucky on a trend.

That's been on hold for a few years. I think that's good news, and we'll open up Old Navy Japan on July 15, just outside of Tokyo. That leaves us with Europe. And our European business, like a lot of other companies, was soft in 2011. The team there is very aware of it. We have a small business in Italy.

The product globally at Gap women's that hurt our overall global Gap business, particularly hit our business in Europe hard, did not register at all with the customers.

We've worked very hard, as we should have, given our performance in 2011. Worked really hard on the product front in getting clarity in each one of our design teams, whether that's addition of talent or was just a better focus, and part of that was the GC, the Gap Global Creative Center in New York City. And the confidence has picked up to the point where some marketing, I want to make sure I'm clear on this, some marketing will go in the Q1. The investments I'm talking about will have to be one earned and they'll have to be -- they will happen, and probably if our business performs at a higher rate through the year. So it's driven by -- if you're going to be making some changes in product and get it right on to the customer in which we need to attract to our stores, we got to go tell that story. We have a lot of marketing in the business. I want to make sure I'm clear about that. So this is a Gap story, mostly in domestic, mostly in North America. Old Navy has plenty of marketing. Their issue in 2011 was it wasn't effective, as we said a number of times on these calls, maybe being as transparent as we are. We were not happy with our marketing up until November when the new platform came out. On the sourcing, the team is just being put together now. We were very pleased with our geographical hub structure up until 2011. Could have made the change then to a more category structure which is aligning all the way through our business from design to merchandising to production to sourcing by categories. But given the spike in cotton, we decided to not do it at that time because we have enough disruptions going on and enough stress in the business to try to manage our way through that challenge. We're in the early days, Jeff. Let's see. This is the month of February. So the team that's been put in place from a category perspective, their first impact in the business will probably be in our holiday buying, which we haven't even begun just yet. So they'll probably have some impact on holiday. The real benefit to me of the category hub structure, it allows us to build much deeper relationships with mills upstream which we do not have today. That's a missed opportunity in our sourcing. We do deal with mills.

I'd say, John, it's difficult to be absolute about this because we have flexibility. Product is the one area we're going to invest in. Again, it's going to be very targeted in key categories that we can dominate in, in selective brands. That's the one with the longest lead time. So I would say that one, as I know today, will likely be the most amount of pure dollars will go into that area. But we also -- we've done some tests ahead of time, some categories, to make sure we know we can resonate with customers. It will be noticed and we'll get paid for it. But we'll be watching it through the year to make sure that those -- that, that outcome actually happens. Marketing would be the next one in line, but that has much more flexibility, much shorter lead times. And e-commerce, I talked about the new Phoenix distribution center. We got full op -- open in full operation in the fall of 2011. There's some mobile investments we're going to make. There's some investments in people that goes into that business as well, and probably the lesser of the money we're spending, as we do every year, as I said at the beginning, we're always -- we're deciding what variable SG&A we want to put in the business to deliver on the strategic plan, but also to hit the framework of the economic model the company needs to have. In terms of what percent were built, here's what they'll tell you. We're at best just finishing our fall buy right now, at best. We haven't even started anything on holiday. We had choices like we have across all of the cost centers in the business. One, negotiate as hard as we can, which is we're going to do regardless, and get savings through the assumption of tailwinds in the back half to put all of that money in the bottom line of the business. But also, we had a choice to pack and go. Where do we believe? We can actually get a win in certain key categories across brands and give our designers and merchandisers a little bit of license to put some more money back into the product. And just one last point on that. When you think a product, to me, it starts with fit, which costs no more money. Just want to have a great fit and consistent fit, then it goes to color. Doesn't cost any more money. You got to have the right color for the season. Then it goes to style, which could be print and pattern as well. It doesn't cost any more money, then it gets to fabric. So our designers and merchants know that in order to have excellent, consistent great product season in, season out, you have to deliver on all 4 of those. All we're trying to highlight today is, there are in some areas, putting some money back into fabric does make strategic sense to us."

There still is uncertainty because as we said, and Glenn just reminded, we just started buying the back half. And there's lots of decisions not only the variables that are macro factors like cotton and labor and all of that, but there's also just our merchants who are making decisions about the mix of the assortment, where they'll reinvest. But all that said, we said we're fairly confident that costing will improve in the back half and our range includes scenarios with improvements. With regard to share repurchase, we also have embedded a range of share repurchases. Now I think it's important that I just underscore, again, we're trying to signal that we are absolutely committed to cash distributions as we have been for many, many years. Nothing in our principal has changed. But definitely, 2012 will be a more normalized, what we consider normalized year share repurchases. And if you look back over the last whatever, 6, 7 years, we sort of averaged $1 billion, $1.3 billion per year. And the timing, obviously, matters about the share repurchases and how accretive they are as they're back half-weighted, front half-weighted, et cetera."

We did get a nice increase in 2011 and we wouldn't expect that same kind of increase in '11, in '12. And the reason is '11 seems to be a really unique year with balances of our customers sort of growing. I guess, that's maybe a sign that people are getting more confident as the economy improves and stabilizes, but the loss rates have stayed pretty low. I think that's fairly unique circumstances.

They come together to formulate a gross margin rate to the senior merchant, but they should be independent decisions, AUC, AIR based on competition and what you want to do by categories. And the AUC piece is just making sure that our sourcing and production teams can get us the best cost and leverage the size of the company. I will say, Paul, that in 2011, given this unique year, particularly in the back half as we spoke about these significant increases in our cost of goods, our teams were much more aware of AUC. Those who had to price AIR, those that who had to make AUR decisions were much more aware of it. Coming in 2012, there's 2 components that are changing based on my opening comments. One, from an assortment perspective, at Old Navy in particular, we felt that we got a little bit off on the spreading of our price points under a good, better, best strategy. Got a little too far up in the best category, and that's going to be managed back to a better balance inside good, better, best. So that's one change that is certainly happening. And then our value businesses, our outlet business and in Old Navy, because of the significant increases that really impacted them in 2011 in the back half. There's a few areas we crossed thresholds with customers, and those adjustments are going to have to be made. And we're going to go back to how we operate the business in 2010, which is really making sure that merchants are 100% focused on the value proposition in the business, and then the production team getting the best cost possible, but not having the relationship be so directly affected one to the other as we did in the back half of '11 given the huge increases."

I'll remind everybody this is category that's had very little inflation for the better part of 20 years. That's the first time we've seen some inflation. And the market leaders on price will be dictating a lot of this and the people who control the floor will be sending signals through everybody, whether they believe the price levels and whatever inflation was allowed to come through in 2011 should sustain itself in 2012.

Before I hand it over to Sabrina to take you through the highlights from the first quarter, I've got some general comments about Q1. First off, as I said in the release, we were pleased with our performance in the first quarter. I think domestically in particular, if you look at our comp performance in each one of our large brands, Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic, we were pleased with that performance and our product teams really stepped up in the first quarter. We've been pretty consistent since our call in February same as last fall. We sat down on this business and took some corrective measures in product and that some of the areas we're making investments in, which I will touch on at the end of these comments. I think color was a trend that everybody took advantage. I think our team did a very good job with that. And generally our product teams really stepped up nicely in this first quarter. We also had some great feedback from our customers on our collaboration with Diane Von, a Gap brand doing DBS for Kids, traffic driver, great execution in the stores and marketing and I think that was very good for Gap brand. And for Banana Republic to tie itself in a partnership with Mad Men, one of the top properties, definitely here in the United States was very good for their business. Again, one of customer increased, great self with the product, and amazing feedback. And lastly, our online business continued to be very strong. Coming off of a 20% increase in 2011, our online business delivered an 18% increase in the first quarter, and we're making a lot of smart investments. In mobile technology, online media and a whole bunch of different areas. Because that's part of our business that we're known for. We have, in my opinion, a competitive advantage, and we continue to invest to make sure that we're actually out there gaining market share on the online business.
Let me switch gears and talk about our growth initiatives and their performance. And just highlight a few of them in the first quarter. Our franchise business added 3 new markets in the first quarter. And more importantly we added 22 stores, that was really strong performance by that team. Our China business added 7 new stores, and the New Market in, and the China business is on track to doing the 30 stores we committed to get done in 2012 and good performance coming off of that team. I happen to be in Japan, 4 weeks ago. And saw the store coming together for Old Navy and a market just outside of Tokyo. A beautiful store, great premarketing, good brand awareness for Old Navy, good initial feedback from customers. So we're very much looking forward to that opening, which will be later this quarter and Athleta is clearly on track at 25 stores. We like the performance stores in 2011. We're seeing so far in 2012. The marketing platform I talked about in the February conference call. So that's coming together nicely and we're looking forward to reporting even more progress when it comes to real estate strategy for Athleta. We talked on the February call about investments. I just want to spend a minute on that, 2 areas in particular investments and our product and investments in marketing. On the product front, our creative advisors are working very well with the design teams at Gap brand on the Tracy Gardner and Old Navy which -- Stanton. Now their work and working alongside of the design teams in each one of those brands, won't be seen till holiday, but very good feedback on the contribution they're making so far. Now more importantly in the first quarter, there were some key categories and we already put some investment into, for our customers to notice and for us to get a much higher sellthrough inside of our stores. So just a couple of examples. Old Navy completely redesigned their whole T-shirt business, and that launched in the first quarter and that was quite a contributor to Old Navy's performance in Q1. And Gap brand put money into their bottoms business and their performance on colored bottoms and colored denim. That was also a big contributor to their performance in the first quarter. So as I mentioned before, we're looking at key categories where we can have a competitive point of differentiation. We will make targeted investments in order to drive our business. Now the marketing front, we did come into the new year with -- for the most part, 5 new creative platforms. Now Old Navy's was tweaked from November of 2011. But for the most part, 5 new creative platforms. The Gap platform, which I assume everybody has seen, it was a global campaign of Be Bright. And that campaign very well received from customers. Good execution in the Windows, in-store, digital execution, strong. Felt very good about what the team did and the reaction we got from customers and then the overall performance of the business. And I really thought that Banana Republic did a very nice job in the first quarter on their marketing platform, which is focused on new work. That was just perfect for that brand and I thought the mediums they used to express that creativity, mostly on direct mail, really came across strongly in got great feedback from their customers.
Last month, we announced the hiring of Stephan Larson from H&M to become the new Global Brand President for Old Navy. Now Stephan will be joining us until the month of October but everybody here is very excited about what he's going to bring to the business. He's had this phenomenal experience in product, in real estate, in sourcing and inventory management but most importantly he's a very global executive. Old Navy's #1 priority is to continue this kind of performance in the domestic business. But with the opening of a store in Japan, and future openings in 2013, Stephan's experience globally will be very helpful to Old Navy as of this point of its evolution.
So in closing, it's nice to get off to a good start, doing $0.47 of EPS. I mean, nice comp performance in the first quarter, 6% total growth. All the numbers that you see in the press release, we feel good about that. But as we've said many times, we have lots of work to do inside the business. While it's nice to celebrate this small win in the first quarter, it's a long year. We have lots of initiatives in place. We need to execute them. But we're committed to making that happen. So with that said, I'll pass on to Sabrina who will take you through the financial highlights for the first quarter. Sabrina?"
274265,206257114,309553,"Gap Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 17, 2012",2012-05-17,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our first quarter performance as it represents meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including improving sales, reinvesting in our business and growing earnings per share. Here are",1103,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our first quarter performance as it represents meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including improving sales, reinvesting in our business and growing earnings per share. Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 6%. Comparable sales were up 4% and all North American divisions posted positive comps for the quarter.
Despite increased average unit costs, gross margins were only down 20 basis points. And finally, our earnings per share grew 18%.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the first quarter, operating income was up $9 million or 2%. Net earnings were flat at $233 million and earnings per share were $0.47, up from $0.40 last year. This includes about $0.01 of benefit related to favorable reinvestments of tax positions in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. First quarter total sales was $3.5 billion, up 6%, with comp sales up 4%. Our new stores and franchise business both contributed to our spread of 2 points. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profits. Gross profit dollars grew by 5% to $1.4 billion. First quarter gross margin was down 20 basis points to 39.4%. While average unit retail continued to be up over last year. Our merchandise margins were down 150 basis points, driven by higher average unit costs. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 130 basis points. As a reminder, the amount of leverage in any given quarter is dependent on a number of factors. Some examples include the timing of store openings and closures, landlord settlements and rent escalation rate. Therefore, although we remain confident that we will leverage rent and occupancy on a positive comp, we were cautioned against extrapolating this magnitude of leverage.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As mentioned in our April sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 7% on last year's up 10%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We noted on last quarter's call that we plan to invest more in our domestic businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, first quarter total operating expenses were $980 million, up $62 million from the prior year, due primarily to investments in marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $20 million to $139 million, driven by increases in CRM and Gap brand marketing.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store counts. First quarter capital expenditures were $148 million. With regard to company-operated stores, we closed 10 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,026 stores.
Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q1 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $216 million compared with an inflow of $104 million last year. We ended the first quarter with about $2 billion in cash and towards short-term investment. On our Q4 earnings call, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and guided that our level of share repurchase in 2012 would be less than 2011. Consistent with that statement, our Q1 share repurchases were minimal, and we ended the quarter with 491 million shares outstanding. And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11.
We're certainly pleased with our progress as reflected in our Q1 performance. That said, there are several factors to consider regarding our full year outlook. First, as I just noted, share repurchases were minimal during the quarter, and therefore, our weighted average share count was impacted not only for the first quarter but likely for the full year. Second, external factors, including weather, were very favorable in the first quarter. And finally, we believe it's important to remain measured in our outlook given that our biggest selling seasons are still ahead of us. Taking these important factors into account, we are raising our estimate for full-year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week to $1.78 to $1.83. As a reminder, our framework for the year, while unchanged from Q4, includes the following: it's our objective to continue to drive modest top line growth with the stabilization of our base business and the continuation of our global growth initiatives. At the same time, we plan to deliver healthy merchandise margin to better product acceptance, inventory discipline and improved average unit cost. While we're confident that our average unit cost on like-for-like product will improve in the second half of 2012, as we noted on our last earnings call, this benefit will be partially offset by select reinvestments into product quality as well as changes in the mix of our product assortments. With regard to occupancy costs, we continue to expect leverage on positive comps. But as I just mentioned, we would caution against extrapolating the magnitude of leverage in the first quarter.
Moving on to operating expenses. We expect to continue to prudently invest more in our domestic businesses and our growth initiative. Therefore, we do not expect operating expense deleverage for the full year. In addition to continued International growth, areas of investment this year include global IT, e-commerce, store payroll and marketing. Specifically, we expect the increase in marketing in the second quarter to be at least as large as it was in the first quarter. With regard to inventory, at the end of Q2, inventory dollars per store are expected to be relatively flat to last year.
Regarding share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the distribution of excess cash to shareholders does not change. However, as a reminder, our approach to share repurchases is highly opportunistic. Given that we repurchased over 200 million shares in 2010 and 2011 at an average price of $19.60, we are comfortable with the slower pace of repurchase in 2012. The following full-year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. Operating margin about 10%. Net square footage, down by about 1%. Company-operated stores, about 130 openings and about 115 closures, both of which are net of repositions. Capital expenditures about $600 million. Depreciation and amortization about $475 million. Effective tax rate about 39.5%.
In closing, we're pleased with about how we executed against our strategy in Q1 and are focused on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you. Now I'll turn it back over to Katrina."

It sounds like there's a little more caution as you look out to the second, third, fourth quarter of the year. Is this just trying to maintain expectations as -- and let the results kind of speak for themselves? Or are there some benefits perhaps in the first quarter that you're worried won't repeat in the rest of the year? We're just trying to square the great performance we saw so far this year with what seems to be a more conservative outlook for the rest of the year."

So I guess I'm going to start by saying we actually feel really confident internally about the progress we're making. So I think that's the important headline. That said, we are only finishing here the first quarter and entering the second. So as I said in my remarks, we have 3 big important quarters ahead of us. So we really want to just remain measured in our outlook. In addition to that, I'm just going to do 3 quick reminders on themes that we outlined since the Q4 earnings call, which is still true. Which is although we still feel good about the average unit costing in the back half, we are reinvesting some of that into quality and assortment mixed decisions that obviously, we feel good about. But its the AUR piece that would need to play out as the year goes on. Second reminder, is that if our momentum continues as we had in the first quarter, we definitely plan on continuing investments in these areas like store payroll, store related expense and marketing. So that's something we'd like to do after 4 years of really, really tight expense discipline. And then finally, and this is a really important point, as I said, we are committed to distributing excess cash. But we've always been very opportunistic about our program. And so I think it's going to be really important to take into account the fact that the share repurchases in the first quarter were minimal, and that is going to really impact sort of how everyone models out there weighted average shares. Obviously, the more back half weighted share repurchase becomes, the less impact it's going to have on the share count for the year."

With regards to this year, you're right. We're not done with the second half. We're not done with holiday yet. But we feel good about our costing. I'm not going to quantify numbers this year but highly unusual for us to ever to that. Last year we did that because the escalation was so unprecedented and meaningful to our P&L. And so we're not going to get into precise numbers. But again, we do feel good about that, which is why we said we feel confident about helping our margins this year. But we will be reinvesting some of that in important key categories. We're not reinvesting everywhere. It's going to be in categories that are important assets to the brand like suiting at Banana Republic, Denim at Gap brand, et cetera. And then there's important mix shift. So a good example of that would be investing in more Gap fit, the athletic pants, putting it in more stores. And that's a higher AUC than things like panties that it might be replacing. So those are examples directionally of where we're headed."

So I'd say that business continues to be strong. It's been a reference to the body business led by the new GapBodyFit business. That was strong in the quarter. So but -- bottoms was slightly very easy for people to start asking that question. Our whole campaign in spring under the Be Bright platform was about bottoms, whether it was woven bottoms, oh or, whether it was the denim in which we did in March. That was a good business for everybody at Gap and that Old Navy as well. So I'd say Gap was fairly nicely spread across all of their different businesses. It wasn't strictly a 5 comp in the quarter led by colored bottoms in women's. That business did well for us, as I'm sure did well for a lot of other retailers but it was really spread nicely across the business, which is encouraging because you don't want to have a one-dimensional driven comp. At Old Navy, I talked earlier at my opening comments with the relaunch of their key program, there was a nice marketing campaign tied into that. That business was very strong. We launched great color selection, the only way Old Navy can. So it was a brand-new T program what very well, marketing very well and that again wasn't a one-dimensional but I referenced it only because it's at the heart of what Old Navy does well. To be quite honest with you, I wish Old Navy would've had a little bit more inventory at colored bottoms. I'm sure we're not the only retailer to make that comment. Somebody was asking me earlier about chasing inventory, I think it was you, John. So the notion from our end was that there was once spot as he could redo it Old Navy such a big business it doesn't take a lot because we're not dealing tens of thousands of units. We're dealing with Old Navy. When Old Navy starts to welcome you talk about hundreds of thousands of units. So the team did the best they could slightly disappointed customers broadening the spring but if there was one category that they would like to have gotten a Mulligan on, it probably would've been on colored bottoms. So I'd other people on the store now that's probably color, the number of categories for Old Navy. So I would say that their assortment exchange with something I talked about in November recall was a contributor, the tease, helpful. They did well on color but they were probably the one brand that it was tough to predict they could have had some more inventory that the category."

We're going to be thoughtful, we mentioned also the word -- we had the flexibility to ship up or down our markets one of those investments that you can make and read your business and if you see that it's actually driving in this case here, the #1 metrics of increasing marketing would be traffic. On the second-biggest metric as far as I'm concerned is increasing yourself with the right price. And so I felt good about the marketing at Gap. How about our new team in New York working with our new agency and the execution of the stores was really well done. We're now in our summer program, which is the evolution of the platform of the Be Bright and now you have meet your own T program, which is instead of bottoms, we're talking about T-shirts at Gap.

And not that by any stretch of the imagination was Gap and Banana Republic done with their commitment to the corporation of continuous improvement week over week, month over month, quarter-over-quarter. But from my lens, they were a little further ahead, and there was some assortment changes. And I think I spoke to assortment mix that had the change and some pricing competitiveness that had to get a little sharp at Old Navy coming off of, as we referenced earlier, through cost increases. It was very challenging fourth quarter for them. So yes, you're right. I'm not saying I was presently surprised. But if I would've handicapped at that in February, having seen all the products, seen all the marketing, knowing the teams, obviously, we're all pleased with the overall floor-comp and the 5 at Gap, 5 and Banana Republic in the in Old Navy sitting here 3 months ago would've been easy for me to think that yes, they were better prepared Banana Republic and Gap for the first quarter. And Old Navy could still have a good quarter. But they probably have to work a little harder. So hands off to Nancy and Tom for -- while still making the changes that I would say Janet now almost done we're on the month of May I think we committed by the call end of May majority of the changes would be in place.

Michael InBev Jones is a leading designer of Old Navy, has a very great team that works with him. Simon is that our head of the Banana Republic has a very good team. Tracy's not our head of design by any stretch of the imagination, but she's this new role called creative advisor. So she's working with a team lead by Pam Wallack in New York. And I would say Tracy as I mentioned in my opening comments, her and Jill have both have a very nice impact on the design teams and are contributing at a very high level. Her impact, based on their contribution and the their contribution and be advised she's providing creative advisor will be felt over the holiday season and Gap brand is one we'll get to see how we're working with a conjunction with this very qualified design team in New York will bring the Gap product for holiday around the globe. Such as in my view and the same would apply to Jill. But Jill, once you start a little bit later than Tracy, Old Navy is pipeline is shorter, so Jill will have the same contribution -- working really with Michael InBev Jones will own all that, that up as he has in the last 4 years provided with ever great advice she can't to Michael and his team to actually really prove our higher level for holiday. So that's on the Tracy front. In terms of Old Navy, I would just say that Janet was definitely May, on the month that we're in right now and near the end of May, we made an assortment probably missed the last reporting week but the assortment that delivers into May, which really we call the June product, will be then the final changes and tweaks from a value proposition, for making sure that the right balance exists out inside of Old Navy between good better and best, which we admitted about 6 months ago, fall and holiday. Those will all be in place and now it just comes down to them working within that framework and designing an amazing product, merchandising, marketing and the stores teams to make sure that Old Navy's triangulation in the village more than 3 fun, fashion, family and value shows up really strongly from June on."

But there's nothing we can really look at Old Navy and see it I'm sure anybody in the value business that some benefit from that.

We would not have gone forward a number of months ago and said we had to Target try to open 25 new stores in 2012. It could be indication that we have in the stores coming worked very favorable. The thing about that business that -- if you're in any other business inside of our building that you got to be envious about would be is productivity per foot is very impressive and they do very well and that's a big driver of that is because of their product and their marketing is their cross-sells are very impressive. And they do a very good job of that as a business. And they look at it and go well, we bought some value and advantages to this team, this company and brand that we brought into the fold a couple of years ago.

I think this year, given that we're actually seeing product assortment improvements that we've been looking for in our North America businesses, we want to support and propel those with investments in the business that we think have a high likelihood of a nice return for our shareholders.

And so we feel good about that, that's because what we try to do  and I think we've been thoughtful about it and explained not on these phone calls, certainly in conferences that we attend, that we like the way we've actually mixed the business internationally. It's a combination of our corporate-owned business, our very strong and exciting franchise business that grew at 30% in the first quarter and now with global online and global outlet. So we're looking at it this way, we're saying we take the mix but we also look at every country. It's such a broad statement as you can appreciate it, you calling International business whether European business we're watching very carefully. The team there in Europe knows that. They're making all the right decisions, whether it's hunkering that down when they want to need to hunker down vacationers stores that are strong for us specially in big centers like London and Paris and Milan and Rome, but those fronts are out there winning, there in difficult conditions in Europe. Now you go sort of around the world and look at our business in Japan, which in the quarter, we had to live with the -- about 6 weeks of the anniversary of the tragedy of 3/11 and then 6 weeks of some recovery. And we do feel really good in Japan otherwise, about our business in general but our team there and about the prospects to putting online, more outlet stores and introduce Old Navy. China, we've committed ourselves to 30 stores this year. We're on track. We did 7 stores in the quarter, which was a nice number for us. That's good. Usually, you don't see front-end loaded real estate as I mentioned in my opening comments and our franchise business up 30% comp was -- sorry, 30% total sales was very strong. So as our -- we don't release this business numbers but our global online business was also very powerful in the first quarter. We really like what we saw in our International markets and China that's why we're looking forward to Japan. Now when it comes to Old Navy Japan, not to get into too many details but I think one thing I would like people to appreciate is, because it's a value business similar to our outlet business, really, what you're looking at here is a push model. So we're -- the Old Navy team in Mission Bay yes, there's a nice collaboration with a very, very small focus team in Japan who's going to do the execution. But really, we're pushing out the product, the marketing, the store design, the standards, the operating model. It's all based on how Old Navy operates here today. That's been pushed out into the Japanese team, and there's a great team in there that going to help executing in conjunction with the team here in North America but a different completely different model that Gap, which we've been working since I've been here to sort of undo a little bit and get to more consistency and continuity around the world which a big part of that was opening of the global center in New York was to get to that. Old Navy started from day 1, we're going to mold it more on a very successful global outlet business and have a team here in San Francisco will be pushing out and let the Japan team execute it very little. I want to be clear on this, very little localization. There'll be some, and we did all our research here. We've talked to so many of our customers and so much research like we did in China like Old Navy, the way is positioned here in North America, will work very well in Japan. That's why there's very little localization."

But also I would say that we want to make sure that we also want to shift the mix of our customers. And as we look at our range of sort of age demographic, business these days are so much more about just age demographic but to be only on that measurement, we do believe there's an opportunity for more customers in the mid, late 20s, early 30s to be experiencing the brand, checking it out. People who may be we've not been as relevant and appealing to in the last number of years to get them to come in and see Gap. Now fortunately for us, a nice trend came by in the early part of this year which really could appeal to a very democratic group of customers, but maybe especially was appealing to people in the age group I just mentioned. So the marketing as you saw was attempted not only in the marketing and the creative that was done from such team and the agency, but also in the medium I would say that the local marketing teams and the global team are choosing to speak to our customers. So I'm actually quite pleased with a little bit of research I've seen. It is early days that's when there's some new customers in the quarter? Absolutely.

It's just we're going to do one store and whether there's another store from there or not, we'll figure it out. But it's something that our customers, given that target for Piperlime, I think we should try it. Now we did this for Athleta, thinking more than Piperlime. We could see sort of a number how big it could be, given -- because it's a different business. But here I think we're going to find out whether it ends up being just a phenomenal marketing be vehicle, so be it. If it ends up something greater than that, going to have commercial success will look at it. I won't know that answer from another year from today. Now what it comes to the competitive landscape, I'm not sure as much if it is the trends that is affecting the landscape. It's obviously, still highly competitive out there but how our teams are thinking about it and I'm saying this a little bit for Brian. This investment in marketing to be determined what level and to what pace we're going to keep it going. But the intention behind that at Banana Republic, online -- Banana Republic a lot of direct-mail. Online obviously, some investments and online media for the total brand for online business and for our store business and the Out of Home marketing we're doing for Gap brand. The intention behind that is to really showcase the brand and get excited about the product and the positioning of those 2 businesses. And because of that, we hope and we saw that in the first quarter where we become less reliant on some of the promotions that all of us got caught up to starting in the summer of 2008. So I'm thinking may be you're correct, that a little bit of a trend, maybe a little bit that the consumer conditions are slightly better than a year ago. They're not great but slightly better than a year ago. And some unique marketing and I would say traffic driving initiatives that each brand is digging, look at Old Navy maybe they're doing something called Super C-A-S-H, which is a bounce back program, which is very successful them, that reduces their dependency on just traditional promotional needs. So all of our teams are thinking creatively secondly there are always think the customer and what the brand for stand for the them what matters them to me how do I win and beat the competition through great ways of getting people across our lease line at a value proposition that fit each one of our brands."

So I came in",594,"On the marketing, as I mentioned on the call, how we think about it I guess across the brands, I mean, we came into the year feeling actually pretty good because we put a lot of time on product and on marketing platforms in the fall of 2011. So I came in thinking for the first time since I've been leading the business, we've had a clear sense of our product direction. And therefore, I would feel more confident I haven't decided yet how much marketing to put into each one of our businesses, but I felt more confident in myself for a long time putting marketing behind the direction in what I believe to be a sustainable direction, not just a one-time quarter. We're hoping our -- that our teams will work really hard. Our design teams, our merchant teams really get the clearer view now of long-term momentum sustainable great product inside of our stores. So the marketing, whether it's the platform I talked about earlier on Be Bright, whether it's the versatile new work at Banana Republic, whether it's Funnovations Inc. with a key focus there being on fun and expression of value on Old Navy, I actually think that our marketing has delivered for us in the first quarter. And no different than product. The marketing teams now that we expect benefit, we expect traffic, we expect a step up in relevance. Because otherwise, why put the money forward? And that's one of the key components for us -- focus on Old Navy. Old Navy is a brand and a value sector. It's a huge competitive advantage. So they have to continue to feed marketing. They have plenty of marketing from last year's. It's not -- not any fresh marketing going into Old Navy. We have a lot plenty of marketing for Elway. The right kind of marketing and the right kind of messaging to build on that differentiation of being a brand in the value sector. Now in the product and price, which we obviously, all you including and the industry what call what's our value proposition, look, I believe the company, because of the unique year in 2011, may have gotten off what I thought was a very good pricing architecture, value proposition in 2010. Now there was unique circumstances. But we've already had our moment where we said we made some mistakes in 2011 by not staying true to a value proposition and pricing architecture and workforce in 2010. So it wasn't very difficult to go back because the competitive landscape is not such a change for us that anyone of our brands need to dramatically shift the architecture and the value proposition in 2010. We just got to tweak it. And I think that I've been part of meetings with the teams because that's something I get involved with, when it comes to the brands. And I do believe there's always work. This is not a static moment. It's fluid. But the work I've seen done so far, what I want to throw -- in fairness I want to throw our outlet business in their to which is a very important pricing architecture and our promotional positioning. But I look at all of those businesses including online and some very good decisions are being made. But I expect them, want to stay highly competitive to know exactly who they're up against, where their share needs to come from and make sure there be protect their value proposition going forward and about making good and intelligent decisions."

Before I hand it over to Sabrina to take you through the highlights from the first quarter, I've got some general comments about Q1. First off, as I said in the release, we were pleased with our performance in the first quarter. I think domestically in particular, if you look at our comp performance in each one of our large brands, Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic, we were pleased with that performance and our product teams really stepped up in the first quarter. We've been pretty consistent since our call in February same at last fall. We sat down as a business and took some corrective measures in product and that some of the areas we're making investments in, which I will touch on at the end of these comments. I think color was a trend that everybody took advantage. I think our team did a very good job with that. Then generally our product teams really stepped up nicely in this first quarter. We also had some great feedback from our customers on our collaboration with, Diane von Furstenberg, a Gap brand doing DVF for Kids, traffic driver, great execution in the stores and marketing and I think that was very good for Gap brand. And for Banana Republic to tie itself in a partnership with Mad Men, one of the top properties, definitely here in the United States was very good for their business. Again, a lot of customer increased, great sell-through in the product, and amazing feedback. And lastly, our online business continued to be very strong. Coming off of a 20% increase in 2011, our online business delivered an 18% increase in the first quarter, and we're making a lot of smart investments in mobile technology, online media and a whole bunch of different areas because that's part of our business that we're known for. We have, in my opinion, a competitive advantage, and we continue to invest to make sure that we're actually out there gaining market share on the online business.
Let me switch gears and talk about our growth initiatives and their performance. I'll just highlight a few of them in the first quarter. Our franchise business added 3 new markets in the first quarter. And more importantly, they added 22 stores, that was really strong performance by that team. Our China business added 7 new stores, and the New Market in Wuhan, and the China business is on track to doing the 30 stores we committed to get done in 2012 and good performance coming off of that team. I happen to be in Japan, 4 weeks ago. And saw the store coming together for Old Navy and a market just outside of Tokyo. A beautiful store, great premarketing, good brand awareness for Old Navy, good initial feedback from customers. So we're very much looking forward to that opening, which will be later this quarter. And Athleta is clearly on track at 25 stores. We like the performance of the stores in 2011. We're seeing so far in 2012. The marketing platform I talked about in the February conference call. So that's coming together nicely, and we're looking forward to reporting even more progress when it comes to real estate strategy for Athleta. 
We talked on the February call about investments. I just want to spend a minute on that, 2 areas in particular investments and our product and investments in marketing. On the product front, our creative advisors are working very well with the design teams at Gap brand on the Tracy Gardner and Old Navy with Jill Stanton. Now their work in working alongside of the design teams in each one of those brands, won't be seen until holiday, but very good feedback on the contribution they're making so far. 
Now more importantly in the first quarter, there were some key categories and we already put some investment into, for our customers to notice and for us to get a much higher sell-through inside of our stores. So just a couple of examples. Old Navy completely redesigned their whole T-shirt business, and that launched in the first quarter and it was quite a contributor to Old Navy's performance in Q1. And Gap brand put money into their bottoms business and their performance on colored bottoms and colored denim. That was also a big contributor to their performance in the first quarter. So as I mentioned before, we're looking at key categories where we can have a competitive point of differentiation. We will make targeted investments in order to drive our business. 
Now the marketing front, we did come into the new year with -- for the most part, 5 new creative platforms. Now Old Navy's was tweaked from November of 2011. But for the most part, 5 new creative platforms. The Gap platform, which I assume everybody has seen, it was a global campaign of Be Bright. And that campaign very well-received from customers. Good execution in the windows, in-store, digital execution, strong. I felt very good about what the team did and the reaction we got from customers and then the overall performance of the business. And I really thought the Banana Republic did a very nice job in the first quarter on their marketing platform, which is focused on new work. That's just perfect for that brand and I thought the mediums they used to express that creativity, mostly on direct mail, really came across strongly and got great feedback from their customers.
Last month, we announced the hiring of Stefan Larsson from H&M to become the new Global Brand President for Old Navy. Now Stefan won't be joining us until the month of October, but everybody here is very excited about what he's going to bring to the business. He's had this phenomenal experience in product, in real estate, in sourcing and inventory management but most importantly he's a very global executive. Old Navy's #1 priority is to continue this kind of performance in its domestic business. But with the opening of the store in Japan and future openings in 2013, Stefan's experience globally will be very helpful to Old Navy as of this point the revolution.
So in closing, it's nice to get off to a good start, doing $0.47 in EPS. I mean, nice comp performance in the first quarter, 6% total growth. All the numbers that you see in the press release, we feel good about that. But as we've said many times, we have lots of work to do inside the business. While it's nice to celebrate this small win in the first quarter, it's a long year. We have lots of initiatives in place. We need to execute them. But we're committed to making that happen. 
So with all that said, let me pass on to Sabrina who will take you through the financial highlights for the first quarter. Sabrina?"

We're pleased with our first quarter performance as it represents meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including improving sales, reinvesting in our business and growing earnings per share. Here are",1105,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our first quarter performance as it represents meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including improving sales, reinvesting in our business and growing earnings per share. Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 6%. Comparable sales were up 4% and all North American divisions posted positive comps for the quarter. Despite increased average unit costs, gross margins were only down 20 basis points. And finally, our earnings per share grew 18%.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the first quarter, operating income was up $9 million or 2%. Net earnings were flat at $233 million and earnings per share were $0.47, up from $0.40 last year. This includes about $0.01 of benefit related to favorable reassessment of tax positions in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. First quarter total sales was $3.5 billion, up 6%, with comp sales up 4%. Our new stores and franchise business both contributed to our spread of 2 points. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profits. Gross profit dollars grew by 5% to $1.4 billion. First quarter gross margin was down 20 basis points to 39.4%. While average unit retail continued to be up over last year. Our merchandise margins were down 150 basis points, driven by higher average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 130 basis points. As a reminder, the amount of leverage in any given quarter is dependent on a number of factors. Some examples include the timing of store openings and closures, landlord settlements and rent escalation rate. Therefore, although we remain confident that we will leverage rent and occupancy on a positive comp, we were cautioned against extrapolating this magnitude of leverage.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As mentioned in our April sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 7% on last year's up 10%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We noted on last quarter's call that we plan to invest more in our domestic businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, first quarter total operating expenses were $980 million, up $62 million from the prior year, due primarily to investments in marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $20 million to $139 million, driven by increases in CRM and Gap brand marketing.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store counts. First quarter capital expenditures were $148 million. With regard to company-operated stores, we closed 10 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,026 stores.
Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q1 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $216 million compared with an inflow of $104 million last year. We ended the first quarter with about $2 billion in cash and short-term investment. On our Q4 earnings call, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and guided that our level of share repurchase in 2012 would be less than 2011. Consistent with that statement, our Q1 share repurchases were minimal, and we ended the quarter with 491 million shares outstanding. And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11.
We're certainly pleased with our progress as reflected in our Q1 performance. That said, there are several factors to consider regarding our full year outlook. First, as I just noted, share repurchases were minimal during the quarter, and therefore, our weighted average share count was impacted not only for the first quarter but likely for the full year. Second, external factors, including weather, were very favorable in the first quarter. And finally, we believe it's important to remain measured in our outlook given that our biggest selling seasons are still ahead of us. Taking these important factors into account, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week to $1.78 to $1.83. As a reminder, our framework for the year, while unchanged from Q4, includes the following: it's our objective to continue to drive modest top line growth with the stabilization of our base business and the continuation of our global growth initiatives. At the same time, we plan to deliver healthy merchandise margin through better product acceptance, inventory discipline and improved average unit cost. While we're confident that our average unit cost on like-for-like product will improve in the second half of 2012, as we noted on our last earnings call, this benefit will be partially offset by select reinvestments into product quality as well as changes in the mix of our product assortments. With regard to occupancy costs, we continue to expect leverage on positive comps. But as I just mentioned, we would caution against extrapolating the magnitude of leverage in the first quarter.
Moving on to operating expenses. We expect to continue to prudently invest more in our domestic businesses and our growth initiative. Therefore, we do not expect operating expense to leverage for the full year. In addition to continued International growth, areas of investment this year include global IT, e-commerce, store payroll and marketing. Specifically, we expect the increase in marketing in the second quarter to be at least as large as it was in the first quarter. With regard to inventory, at the end of Q2, inventory dollars per store are expected to be relatively flat to last year.
Regarding share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the distribution of excess cash to shareholders does not change. However, as a reminder, our approach to share repurchases is highly opportunistic. Given that we repurchased over 200 million shares in 2010 and 2011 at an average price of $19.60, we are comfortable with the slower pace of repurchase in 2012. The following full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. Operating margin about 10%. Net square footage, down by about 1%. Company-operated stores, about 130 openings and about 115 closures, both of which are net of repositions. Capital expenditures about $600 million. Depreciation and amortization about $475 million. Effective tax rate about 39.5%.
In closing, we're pleased with about how we executed against our strategy in Q1 and are focused on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you. Now I'll turn it back over to Katrina."

In addition to that, I'm just going to do 3 quick reminders on themes that we outlined since the Q4 earnings call that are still true, which is -- although we feel good about our average unit costing in the back half, we are reinvesting some of that into quality and assortment mixed decisions that obviously, we feel good about. But its the AUR piece that would need to play out as the year goes on. Second reminder, is that if our momentum continues as we had in the first quarter, we definitely plan on continuing investments in these areas like store payroll, store-related expense and marketing. So that's something we'd like to do after 4 years of really, really tight expense discipline. And then finally, and this is a really important point, as I said, we are committed to distributing excess cash. But we've always been very opportunistic about our program. And so I think it's going to be really important to take into account the fact that the share repurchases in the first quarter were minimal, and that is going to really impact sort of how everyone models out their weighted average shares. Obviously, the more back half weighted share repurchase becomes, the less impact it's going to have on the share count for the year."

With regards to this year, you're right. We're not done with the second half. We're not done with holiday yet. But we feel good about our costing. I'm not going to quantify numbers this year, it's highly unusual for us to ever do that. Last year, we did that because the escalation was so unprecedented and meaningful to our P&L. And so we're not going to get into precise numbers. But again, we do feel good about that, which is why we said we feel confident about helping our margins this year. But we will be reinvesting some of that in important key categories. We're not at reinvesting everywhere. It's going to be in categories that are important assets to the brand like suiting at Banana Republic, denim at Gap brand, et cetera. And then there's important mix shift. So a good example of that would be investing in more Gap fit, the athletic pants, putting it in more stores. And that's a higher AUC than things like panties that it might be replacing. So those are examples, directionally, of where we're headed."

So I'd say that business continues to be strong. It's being reference to the body business led by the new GapBodyFit business. That was strong in the quarter. So but -- bottoms was likely very easy for people to start asking that question. Our whole campaign in spring under the Be Bright platform was about bottoms, whether it was woven bottoms, twirler, whether it was the denim which we did in March. That was a good business for everybody at Gap and at Old Navy as well. So I'd say Gap was fairly nicely spread across all of their different businesses. It wasn't strictly a 5 comp on the quarter led by colored bottoms in women's. That business did well for us, as I'm sure did well for a lot of other retailers but it was really spread nicely across the business, which is encouraging, because you don't want to have a one-dimensional driven comp. At Old Navy, there I talked earlier at my opening comments with the relaunch of their key program, there was a nice marketing campaign tied into that. That business was very strong. We launched great color selection, the way only Old Navy can. So it's a -- it was a brand-new T program, bought very well, marketed very well and that again wasn't a one-dimensional, but I referenced it only because that's really at the heart of what Old Navy does well. To be quite honest with you, I wish Old Navy would have had a little bit more inventory in colored bottoms. I'm sure we're not the only retailer to make that comment. Somebody was asking me earlier about chasing, about inventory, I think it was you, actually, John. So the notion from our end was that there was once spot that as you could redo it -- But Old Navy is such a big business. It doesn't take a lot because we're not dealing in tens of thousands of units. We're dealing with Old Navy. When Old Navy starts to do well, you're talking about hundreds of thousands of units. So the team did the best they could, slightly disappointed customers broadly in the spring. But if there was one category that they would like to have gotten a mulligan on, it probably would have been on colored bottoms. So but now -- if you'd go on in our store now, there's definitely probably color in a number of categories for Old Navy. So I would say that their assortment mix change, which something I talked about in the February call was a contributor. The Ts helpful. They did well on color but they were probably the one brand that wished -- because it was tough to predict they could have some more inventory in that key category."

And the second biggest metric, as far as I'm concerned, is increasing your sell-through with the right price. And so I felt good about the marketing at Gap, about our new team in New York working with our new agency and the execution of the stores was really well done. We're now in our summer program, which is the evolution of the platform of Be Bright and now you have meet your own T program, which is instead of bottoms, we're talking about T-shirts at Gap.

But from my lens, they were a little further ahead, and there was some assortment changes. And I think I spoke to assortment mix that had to change and some pricing competitiveness that had to get a little sharp at Old Navy coming off of, as we referenced earlier, through cost increases, a very challenging fourth quarter for them. So yes, you're right. I'm not saying I was presently surprised. But if I would have handicapped it back in February, having seen all the products, seen all the marketing, knowing the teams, well, I was -- obviously, we're all pleased with the overall floor-comp and the 5 at Gap, 5 at Banana Republic and the 4 in Old Navy.

Tracy is not our head of design by any stretch of the imagination, but she has this new role called creative advisor. So she's working with a team lead by Pam Wallack in New York. And I would say Tracy as I mentioned in my opening comments, her and Jill have both have a very nice impact on the design teams and are contributing at a very high level. Her impact based on her contribution and the advice she is providing as creative advisor will be felt over the holiday season and Gap brand is one we'll get to see how her working in conjunction with this very qualified design team in New York will bring the Gap product for holiday around the globe. So that's my view and the same would apply to Jill. Because Jill, once you start a little bit later than Tracy, Old Navy is pipeline is shorter, so Jill will have the same contribution -- working really with Michael Ingram Jones who will own all that product as he has in the last 4 years, providing whatever great advice she can to Michael and his team to actually really prove our assortment to even a higher level for holiday. So that's on the Tracy front. In terms of Old Navy, what I would just say to Janet was definitely May, on the month that we're in right now and near the end of May, I'd say we made assortment, probably missed the last reporting week but the assortment that delivers into May, which really we call the June product, will be when the final changes and tweaks from a value proposition, for making sure that the right balance exists inside of Old Navy between good, better and best, which we admitted about 6 months ago, might have gone a little bit off in the fall and holiday. Those will all be in place and now it just comes down to them working within that framework and designing an amazing product, merchandising, marketing and the store teams to make sure that Old Navy's triangulation even though it's more than 3 of fun, fashion, family and value shows up really strongly from June on."

But certainly, this year, we would like to make those investments that we've been pointing to since last quarter's call, focused mostly on the domestic business. Because, again, I'll point to the fact that we're pleased that since 2008 -- between 2008 and 2011, that total expense base remained relatively flat while we were making some significant investments internationally or I should say globally. So our global online launch, our launch in China, our launch in Italy. And so we were very disciplined about trade-outs as we made that to keep that line tight. And we felt fine about that. I think this year, given that we're actually seeing product assortment improvements that we've been looking for in our North America businesses, we want to support and propel those with investments in the business that we think have a high likelihood of a nice return for our shareholders. So that's clearly our position this year. How long that might last? More to come. But it's certainly our position this year. And again, we'll watch the pacing and momentum because we definitely are always balancing, driving value to our shareholders and we'll be responsible about the magnitude of those investments depending on that top line."

And so we feel good about that, that's because what we try to do and I think we've been thoughtful about it and explained, if it's not on these phone calls, it's certainly in conferences that we attend, that we like the way we've actually mixed the business internationally. But it's a combination of our corporate-owned business, our very strong and exciting franchise business that grew at 30% in the first quarter and now with global online and global outlet. So we're looking at it this way, we're saying, look, we take the mix but we also look at every country. It's such a broad statement as you can appreciate it, calling it International business whether European business we're watching very carefully. The team there in Europe knows that. They're making all the right decisions, whether it's hunkering that down when they have to hunker down, making sure the stores that are strong for, especially in big centers like London and Paris and Milan and Rome, but those stores are strong and out there winning, there's -- they're in difficult conditions in Europe. Now we go sort of around the world and look at our business in Japan, which in the quarter, we had to live with the -- about 6 weeks of the anniversary of the tragedy of 3/11 and then 6 weeks of some recovery. And we do feel really good in Japan otherwise, about our business in general but our team there and about the prospects to putting online more outlet stores and introduce Old Navy. China, we've committed ourselves to 30 stores this year. We're on track. We did 7 stores in the quarter, which was a nice number for us. That's good. Usually, you don't see front-end loaded real estate as I mentioned in my opening comments and our franchise business of 30% comp was -- sorry, 30% total sales was very strong. So as our -- we don't release this business numbers, but our global online business was also very powerful in the first quarter. We really like what we saw in our International markets and in China, that's why we're looking forward to Japan. Now when it comes to Old Navy Japan, not to get into too many details, but I think one thing I would like people to appreciate is, because it's a value business similar to our outlet business, really, what you're looking at here is a push model. So we're -- the Old Navy team in Mission Bay, yes, there's a nice collaboration with a very, very small focus team in Japan who's going to do the execution. But really, we're pushing out the product, the marketing, the store design, the standards, the operating model. It's all based on how Old Navy operates here today. That's been pushed out into the Japanese team, and there's a great team there that are going to help execute it, working in conjunction with the team here in North America. But a different completely different model than Gap, which we've been working since I've been here to sort of undo a little bit and get to more consistency and continuity around the world, which a big part of that was opening the global center in New York was to get to that. Old Navy started from day 1, we're going to mold it more off our very successful global outlet business and have a team here in San Francisco will be pushing out and let the Japan team execute it with very little -- I want to be clear on this, very little localization. There'll be some, and we did all our research here. We've talked to so many of our customers and so much research like we did in China like Old Navy, the way it's positioned here in North America, will work very well in Japan. That's why there's very little localization."

But also I would say that we want to make sure that we also want to shift the mix of our customers. And as we look at our range of sort of age demographic, business these days are so much more about just age demographic but to be only on that measurement, we do believe there's an opportunity for more customers in the mid, late 20s, early 30s to be experiencing the brand, checking it out. People who may be we've not been as relevant and appealing to in the last number of years to get them to come in to see Gap. Now fortunately for us, a nice trend came by in the early part of this year which really could appeal to a very democratic group of customers, but maybe, especially was appealing to people in the age group I just mentioned. So the marketing as you saw was attempted not only in the marketing and the creative that was done from Seth's team and the agency, but also in the medium I would say that the local marketing teams and the global team are choosing to speak to our customers. So I'm actually quite pleased with a little bit of research I've seen. It is early days that when there's some new customers in the quarter? Absolutely. But I'm really -- what I'm digging deep into -- as I know art in North America in particular, is digging deep into is what kind of mix of customers is he getting? And that is one of the goals of the incremental marketing."

I mean, we've had years where our pattern is very lumpy and we've had years where we haven't bought in the first quarter and it's been back half weighted. I think what was unusual about the first quarter was that -- for our stock to go from under 19 when we entered the quarter all the way above 29, that's just an unusual movement in the stock very quickly. And so our programs just sort of didn't catch up with that level of movement, let's say. But we're obviously, long-term believers in our stock and nothing's changed with regard to our philosophy of distributing that excess cash. So share repurchase is embedded in our overall spectrum of scenarios and our guidance. I think it's just important once again to factor in that it -- the timing matters. So the more back half weighted you get, it actually can have a meaningful difference in that weighted average share count."

On Piperlime, look, I'd say in some ways, we're taking a little bit of the blueprint from Athleta. Now they're different businesses for sure. In the Athleta, purpose we're doing stores was so -- such a strong call from our customers who bought on catalog and online, but the nature of that product, they really wanted the opportunity to physically experience the brand and try that product on because it's so technical. And the customers, they are going after, well, they really love the online experience and were inspired from the catalog, they really wanted a physical manifestation of the brand. Well, we've taken that blueprint for Piperlime and so it's tough. If we were steady right now in September in SoHo, I could articulate to you how that 4,500 square foot store is going to come across. But I actually think, as pleased as I was because we have a central team that does designed. As I'm pleased with that team -- central team on store design that came up with the magic to how to translate Athleta from an online business to bricks-and-mortar off-line business. I really believe that team is going to do the exact same thing for Piperlime. Now it's one store, right? So nobody's going to get excited. It's just we're going to do one store and whether there's another store from there or not, we'll figure it out. But it's something that our customers, given that target for Piperlime I've asked for, I think we should try it. Now we did this for Athleta, thinking more than Piperlime. We could see some kind of rollout that was more what's the number, how big it could be, given -- because it's a different business. But here I think we're going to find out whether it ends up being just a phenomenal marketing vehicle, so be it. If it ends up something greater than that, they can have commercial success, we'll look at it. This will -- I won't know that answer from another year from today. Now what it comes to the competitive landscape, I'm not sure as much if it is the trends that is affecting the competitive landscape. It's obviously, still highly competitive out there but how our teams are thinking about it and I'm saying this a little bit to Brian. This investment in marketing to be determined what level and to what pace we're going to keep it going. But the intention behind that at Banana Republic, online -- Banana Republic a lot of direct-mail. Online, obviously, some investments and online media for the total brand for online business and for our store business and the out-of-home marketing we're doing for Gap brand. The intention behind that is to really showcase the brand and get excited behind the product and the positioning of those 2 businesses. And because of that, we hope and we saw that in the first quarter where we become less reliant on some of the promotions that all of us got caught up to starting in the summer of 2008. So I'm thinking may be you're correct, that a little bit of a trend, maybe a little bit that the consumer conditions are slightly better than a year ago. They're not great but slightly better than a year ago. And some unique marketing and I would say traffic driving initiatives that each brand is digging, look at Old Navy they're doing something called Super C-A-S-H, which is a bounce back program, which is very successful for them, that reduces their dependency on just traditional promotional needs. So all of our teams are thinking, one, creatively; secondly, there are always thinking about the customer and what the brand stands for, for them; and thirdly, which matters most to me, how do I win and beat the competition through great ways of getting people across our lease line at a value proposition that fit each one of our brands."

So I came in thinking for the first time since I've been leading the business, we've had a clear sense of our product direction. And therefore, I would feel more confident I haven't decided yet how much marketing to put into each one of our businesses, but I felt more confident, I felt it a long time, putting marketing behind the direction in what I believe to be the sustainable direction. It's not just a onetime quarter, we're hoping our -- that our teams who've worked really hard, design teams, our merchant teams really get the clearer view now of long-term momentum sustainable great product inside of our stores. So the marketing, whether it's the platform I talked about earlier on Be Bright, whether it's the versatile new work at Banana Republic, whether it's Funnovations Inc. with the key focus there being on fun and expression of value on Old Navy, I actually think that our marketing has delivered for us in the first quarter. And no different than product. The marketing teams now that we expect benefit, we expect traffic, we expect a step up in relevance. Because otherwise, why put the money forward? And that's one of the key components for us. Now focus on Old Navy. Old Navy is a brand and a value sector. It's a huge competitive advantage. So they have to continue to feed marketing. They have plenty of marketing from last year's. It's not -- it's not any fresh marketing going into Old Navy. They have plenty of marketing from Elway. Their issue is just continue to do the right kind of marketing and the right kind of messaging to build on that differentiation of being a brand in the value sector. Now in the product and price, which we all -- obviously all, you including Dana, the industry call what's our value proposition, look, I believe the company, because of the unique year in 2011, may have gotten off what I thought was a very good pricing architecture, value proposition in 2010. Now there was unique circumstances. But we've already had our moment where we said we made some mistakes in 2011 by not staying true to a value proposition and pricing architecture, the workforce in 2010. So it wasn't very difficult to go back because the competitive landscape is not such a change for us that anyone of our brands need to dramatically shift the architecture and the value proposition in 2010. We just got to tweak it. And I think that I've been part of meetings with the teams because that's something I get involved with, when it comes to the brands. And I do believe there's always work. This is not a static moment. It's fluid. But the work I've seen done so far, what I want to throw -- in fairness, I want to throw our outlet business in their, too, which is a very important pricing architecture and their promotional positioning. But I look at all of those businesses including online, I think some very good decisions are being made. But I expect them, want to stay highly competitive to know exactly who they're up against, where their share needs to come from and make sure they protect their value proposition going forward, while making good intelligent decisions."

Before I hand it over to Sabrina to take you through the highlights from the first quarter, I've got some general comments about Q1. First off, as I said in the release, we were pleased with our performance in the first quarter. I think domestically in particular, if you look at our comp performance in each one of our large brands, Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic, we were pleased with that performance and our product teams really stepped up in the first quarter. We've been pretty consistent since our call in February, saying that last fall we sat down as a business and took some corrective measures in product and that some of the areas we're making investments in, which I will touch on at the end of these comments. I think color was a trend that everybody took advantage. I think our team did a very good job with that. Then generally our product teams really stepped up nicely in this first quarter. We also had some great feedback from our customers on our collaboration with Diane von Furstenberg, a Gap brand doing DVF for Kids, traffic driver, great execution in the stores and marketing and I think that was very good for Gap brand. And for Banana Republic to tie itself in a partnership with Mad Men, one of the top properties, definitely here in the United States was very good for their business. Again, a lot of customer increased, great sell-through in the product, and amazing feedback. And lastly, our online business continued to be very strong. Coming off of a 20% increase in 2011, our online business delivered an 18% increase in the first quarter, and we're making a lot of smart investments in mobile technology, online media and a whole bunch of different areas because that's part of our business that we're known for. We have, in my opinion, a competitive advantage, and we continue to invest to make sure that we're actually out there gaining market share on the online business.
Let me switch gears and talk about our growth initiatives and their performance. I'll just highlight a few of them in the first quarter. Our franchise business added 3 new markets in the first quarter. And more importantly, they added 22 stores, that was really strong performance by that team. Our China business added 7 new stores, and a New Market in Wuhan, and the China business is on track to doing the 30 stores we committed to get done in 2012 and good performance coming off of that team. I happen to be in Japan, 4 weeks ago. And saw the store coming together for Old Navy in a market just outside of Tokyo. A beautiful store, great premarketing, good brand awareness for Old Navy, good initial feedback from customers. So we're very much looking forward to that opening, which will be later this quarter. And Athleta is clearly on track to add 25 stores. We like the performance of the stores in 2011. We're seeing so far in 2012. A new marketing platform I talked about in the February conference call. So that's coming together nicely, and we're looking forward to reporting on even more progress when it comes to real estate strategy for Athleta. 
We talked on the February call about investments. I just thought I’d  spend a minute on that, 2 areas in particular, investments in our product and investments in marketing. On the product front, our creative advisors are working very well with the design teams at Gap brand with the Tracy Gardner and Old Navy with Jill Stanton. Now their work in working alongside of the design teams in each one of those brands, won't be seen until holiday, but very good feedback on the contribution they're making so far. 
Now more importantly in the first quarter, there were some key categories that we already put some investment into, for our customers to notice and for us to get a much higher sell-through inside of our stores. So just a couple of examples. Old Navy completely redesigned their whole T-shirt business, and that launched in the first quarter and it was quite a contributor to Old Navy's performance in Q1. And Gap brand put money into their bottoms business and their performance on colored bottoms and colored denim. That was also a big contributor to their performance in the first quarter. So as I mentioned before, we're looking at key categories where we can have a competitive point of differentiation. We will make targeted investments in order to drive our business. 
Now the marketing front, we did come into the new year with -- for the most part, 5 new creative platforms. Now Old Navy's was tweaked from November of 2011. But for the most part, 5 new creative platforms. The Gap platform, which I assume everybody has seen, it was a global campaign of Be Bright. And that campaign very well-received from customers. Good execution in the windows, in-store, digital execution, strong. I felt very good about what the team did and the reaction we got from customers and then the overall performance of the business. And I really thought the Banana Republic did a very nice job in the first quarter on their marketing platform, which is focused on new work. That's just perfect for that brand and I thought the mediums they used to express that creativity, mostly on direct mail, really came across strongly and got great feedback from their customers.
Last month, we announced the hiring of Stefan Larsson from H&M to become the new Global Brand President for Old Navy. Now Stefan won't be joining us until the month of October, but everybody here is very excited about what he's going to bring to the business. He's had this phenomenal experience in product, in real estate, in sourcing and inventory management but most importantly he's a very global executive. Old Navy's #1 priority is to continue this kind of performance in its domestic business. But with the opening of the store in Japan and future openings in 2013, Stefan's experience globally will be very helpful to where Old Navy is at this point of their revolution.
So in closing, it's nice to get off to a good start, doing $0.47 in EPS. I mean, nice comp performance in the first quarter, 6% total growth. All the numbers that you see in the press release, we feel good about that. But as we've said many times, we have lots of work to do inside the business. While it's nice to celebrate this small win in the first quarter, it's a long year. We have lots of initiatives in place. We need to execute them. But we're committed to making that happen. 
So with all that said, let me pass on to Sabrina who will take you through the financial highlights for the first quarter. Sabrina?"

We're pleased with our first quarter performance as it represents meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including improving sales, reinvesting in our business and growing earnings per share. Here are",1105,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our first quarter performance as it represents meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including improving sales, reinvesting in our business and growing earnings per share. Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 6%. Comparable sales were up 4% and all North American divisions posted positive comps for the quarter. Despite increased average unit costs, gross margins were only down 20 basis points. And finally, our earnings per share grew 18%.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the first quarter, operating income was up $9 million or 2%. Net earnings were flat at $233 million and earnings per share were $0.47, up from $0.40 last year. This includes about $0.01 of benefit related to favorable reassessment of tax positions in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. First quarter total sales was $3.5 billion, up 6%, with comp sales up 4%. Our new stores and franchise business both contributed to our spread of 2 points. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profits. Gross profit dollars grew by 5% to $1.4 billion. First quarter gross margin was down 20 basis points to 39.4%. While average unit retail continued to be up over last year. Our merchandise margins were down 150 basis points, driven by higher average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 130 basis points. As a reminder, the amount of leverage in any given quarter is dependent on a number of factors. Some examples include the timing of store openings and closures, landlord settlements and rent escalation base. Therefore, although we remain confident that we will leverage rent and occupancy on a positive comp, we would caution against extrapolating this magnitude of leverage.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As mentioned in our April sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 7% on last year's up 10%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We noted on last quarter's call that we plan to invest more in our domestic businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's unlikely we will leverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, first quarter total operating expenses were $980 million, up $62 million from the prior year, due primarily to investments in marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $20 million to $139 million, driven by increases in CRM and Gap brand marketing.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store counts. First quarter capital expenditures were $148 million. With regard to company-operated stores, we closed 10 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,026 stores.
Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q1 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $216 million compared with an inflow of $104 million last year. We ended the first quarter with about $2 billion in cash and short-term investment. On our Q4 earnings call, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and guided that our level of share repurchase in 2012 would be less than 2011. Consistent with that statement, our Q1 share repurchases were minimal, and we ended the quarter with 491 million shares outstanding. And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11.
We're certainly pleased with our progress as reflected in our Q1 performance. That said, there are several factors to consider regarding our full year outlook. First, as I just noted, share repurchases were minimal during the quarter, and therefore, our weighted average share count was impacted not only for the first quarter but likely for the full year. Second, external factors, including weather, were very favorable in the first quarter. And finally, we believe it's important to remain measured in our outlook given that our biggest selling seasons are still ahead of us. Taking these important factors into account, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week to $1.78 to $1.83. As a reminder, our framework for the year, while unchanged from Q4, includes the following: it's our objective to continue to drive modest top line growth with the stabilization of our base business and a continuation of our global growth initiatives. At the same time, we plan to deliver healthy merchandise margin through better product acceptance, inventory discipline and improved average unit cost. While we're confident that our average unit cost on like-for-like product will improve in the second half of 2012, as we noted on our last earnings call, this benefit will be partially offset by select reinvestments into product quality as well as changes in the mix of our product assortments. With regard to occupancy costs, we continue to expect leverage on positive comps. But as I just mentioned, we would caution against extrapolating the magnitude of leverage in the first quarter.
Moving on to operating expenses. We expect to continue to prudently invest more in our domestic businesses and our growth initiative. Therefore, we do not expect operating expense to leverage for the full year. In addition to continued International growth, areas of investment this year include global IT, e-commerce, store payroll and marketing. Specifically, we expect the increase in marketing in the second quarter to be at least as large as it was in the first quarter. With regard to inventory, at the end of Q2, inventory dollars per store are expected to be relatively flat to last year.
Regarding share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the distribution of excess cash to shareholders has not changed. However, as a reminder, our approach to share repurchases is highly opportunistic. Given that we repurchased over 200 million shares in 2010 and 2011 at an average price of $19.60, we are comfortable with the slower pace of repurchase in 2012. The following full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. Operating margin about 10%. Net square footage, down by about 1%. Company-operated stores, about 130 openings and about 115 closures, both of which are net of repositions. Capital expenditures about $600 million. Depreciation and amortization about $475 million. Effective tax rate about 39.5%.
In closing, we're pleased with about how we executed against our strategies in Q1 and are focused on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you. Now I'll turn it back over to Katrina."

It sounds like there's a little more caution as you look out to the second, third, fourth quarter of the year. Is this just trying to maintain expectations as -- and let the results kind of speak for themselves? Or are there some benefits perhaps in the first quarter that you're worried won't repeat in the rest of the year? We're just trying to square the great performance we saw so far this year with what seems to be a more conservative outlook for the rest of the year."

So I guess I'm going to start by saying we actually feel really confident internally about the progress we're making. So I think that's the important headline. That said, we are only finishing here the first quarter and entering the second. So as I said in my remarks, we have 3 big important quarters ahead of us. So we really want to just remain measured in our outlook. In addition to that, I'm just going to do 3 quick reminders on themes that we outlined since the Q4 earnings call that are still true, which is -- although we feel good about our average unit costing in the back half, we are reinvesting some of that into quality and assortment mix decisions that obviously, we feel good about. But it’s the AUR piece that will need to play out as the year goes on. Second reminder, is that if our momentum continues as we had in the first quarter, we definitely plan on continuing investments in these areas like store payroll, store-related expense and marketing. So that's something we'd like to do after 4 years of really, really tight expense discipline. And then finally, and this is a really important point, as I said, we are committed to distributing excess cash. But we've always been very opportunistic about our program. And so I think it's going to be really important to take into account the fact that the share repurchases in the first quarter were minimal, and that is going to really impact sort of how everyone models out their weighted average shares. Obviously, the more back half weighted share repurchase becomes, the less impact it's going to have on the share count for the year."

And then kind of on the same path, really the same question is inventory unit plans."

And last year, just to be clear, not fall wasn't up 20%, we said our entire back half was up about 20%. And that included holiday, which was actually the peak, costing was in holiday last year. So that just a -- a nuance",243,"Yes. So I'll start that, Adrienne. And last year, just to be clear, not fall wasn't up 20%, we said our entire back half was up about 20%. And that included holiday, which was actually the peak, costing was in holiday last year. So that just a -- a nuance that I just wanted to make sure we're grounded on. With regards to this year, you're right. We're not done with the second half. We're not done with holiday yet. But we feel good about our costing. I'm not going to quantify numbers this year, it was highly unusual for us to ever do that. Last year, we did that because the escalation was so unprecedented and meaningful to our P&L. And so we're not going to get into precise numbers. But again, we do feel good about that, which is why we said we feel confident about healthier margins this year. But we will be reinvesting some of that in important key categories. We're not at reinvesting everywhere. It's going to be in categories that are important assets to the brand like suiting at Banana Republic, denim at Gap brand, et cetera. And then there's important mix shift. So a good example of that would be investing in more Gap fit, the athletic pants, putting it in more stores. And that's a higher AUC than things like panties that it might be replacing. So those are examples, directionally, of where we're headed."

So I'd say that business continues to be strong. It's being reference to the body business led by the new GapBodyFit business. That was strong in the quarter. So but -- bottoms was likely very easy for people to start asking that question. It was our whole campaign in spring under the Be Bright platform was about bottoms, whether it was woven bottoms, and twill, or whether it was the denim which we did in March. That was a good business for everybody at Gap and at Old Navy as well. So I'd say Gap was fairly nicely spread across all of their different businesses. It wasn't strictly a 5 comp on the quarter led by colored bottoms in women's. That business did well for us, as I'm sure did well for a lot of other retailers but it was really spread nicely across the business, which is encouraging, because you don't want to have a one-dimensional driven comp. At Old Navy, today I talked earlier at my opening comments about the relaunch of their T program, there was a nice marketing campaign tied into that. That business was very strong. Relaunched great color selection, the way only Old Navy can. So it's a -- it was a brand-new T program, bought very well, marketed very well and that again wasn't a one-dimensional, but I referenced it only because that's really at the heart of what Old Navy does well. To be quite honest with you, I wish Old Navy would have had a little bit more inventory in colored bottoms. I'm sure we're not the only retailer to make that comment. Somebody was asking Sabrina earlier about chasing, about inventory, I think it was you, actually, John. So the notion from our end was that there was once spot that as you could redo it -- But Old Navy is such a big business. It doesn't take a lot because we're not dealing in tens of thousands of units. We're dealing with Old Navy. When Old Navy starts to do well, you're talking about hundreds of thousands of units. So the team did the best they could, and it’s not like we disappointed customers broadly in the spring. But if there was one category that they would like to have gotten a mulligan on, it probably would have been on colored bottoms. So but now -- if you'd go on in our store now, there's definitely color on a number of categories for Old Navy. So I would say that their assortment mix change, which is something I talked about in the February call was a contributor. The Ts helpful. They did well on color but they were probably the one brand that wished -- because it was tough to predict they could have some more inventory in that key category."

What I can tell you is when we had the call in February and said look, we're going to put some more money in marketing. We're going to be thoughtful, we've mentioned also that we're -- we had the flexibility to ship up or down on marketing. It’s one of those investments that you can make and read your business and if you see that it's actually driving in this case here, one of the #1 metrics have increase in -- marketing would be traffic. And the second biggest metric, as far as I'm concerned, is increasing your sell-through with the right price. And so I felt good about the marketing at Gap, about our new team in New York working with our new agency and the execution of the stores was really well done. We're now in our summer program, which is the evolution of the platform of Be Bright and now you have meet your own T program, which is instead of bottoms, we're talking about T-shirts at Gap. So we can quantify, we can quantify the mediums, we can quantify markets, we can quantify the actual impact on creative. All that has been done and it's helping  inform better decisions in summer, fall and holiday."

And not that by any stretch of the imagination was Gap and Banana Republic done with their commitment to the corporation of continuous improvement week over week, month over month, quarter-over-quarter. But from my lens, they were a little further ahead, and there was some assortment changes. And I think I spoke to assortment mix that had to change and some pricing competitiveness that had to get a little sharper at Old Navy coming off of, as we referenced earlier, through cost increases, a very challenging fourth quarter for them. So yes, you're right. I'm not saying I was presently surprised. But if I would have handicapped it back in February, having seen all the products, seen all the marketing, knowing the teams, while, I was -- obviously, we're all pleased with the overall 4 -comp and the 5 at Gap, 5 at Banana Republic and the 4 at Old Navy. Sitting here 3 months ago, would have been easier for me to think that yes, they were better prepared Banana Republic and Gap for the first quarter. And Old Navy could still have a good quarter. But they probably have to work a little harder. So hats off to Nancy and Tom for -- while still making the changes that I would say, Janet, now are almost done. We're in the month of May. I think I committed on the call by the end of May, the majority of their changes would be in place.

Michael Ingram Jones is our leader of design at Old Navy, but he has a very great team that works with him. Simon Kneen is our head of design at Banana Republic, has a very good team. Tracy is not our head of design by any stretch of the imagination, but she has this new role called creative advisor. So she's working with a team lead by Pam Wallack in New York. And I would say Tracy as I mentioned in my opening comments, her and Jill have both have a very nice impact on the design teams and are contributing at a very high level. Her impact based on her contribution and the advice she is providing as creative advisor will be felt over the holiday season and Gap brand is one we'll get to see how her working in conjunction with this very qualified design team in New York will bring the Gap product for holiday around the globe. So that's my view and the same would apply to Jill. Because Jill, once you start a little bit later than Tracy, Old Navy is pipeline is shorter, so Jill will have the same contribution -- working really with Michael Ingram Jones who will own all our product as he has in the last 4 years, providing whatever great advice she can to Michael and his team to actually really prove our assortment to even a higher level for holiday. So that's on the Tracy front. In terms of Old Navy, what I would just say to Janet was definitely May, on the month that we're in right now and near the end of May, I'd say we made assortment, probably missed the last reporting week but the assortment that delivers into May, which really we call the June product, will be when the final changes and tweaks from a value proposition, for making sure that the right balance exists inside of Old Navy between good, better and best, which we admitted about 6 months ago, might have gone a little bit off in the fall and holiday. Those will all be in place and now it just comes down to them working within that framework and designing amazing product, merchandising, marketing and the store teams to make sure that Old Navy's triangulation even though it's more than 3 of fun, fashion, family and value shows up really strongly from June on."

But we're not, Old Navy's not by any stretch of the imagination, J.C. Penney's #1 competitor. I'm sure there's other brands you can think of, the more likely when they reported their first quarter. If they had comps, it might have been above their run rate comp, maybe they got more benefit. But there's nothing we can really look at Old Navy and see it but I'm sure anybody in the value business got some benefit from that. And that team there, I'm not speaking for them, but they're going through a lot of unique work to change their business model.

Now with Athleta, the four-wall businesses -- we're actually really pleased.

It could be indication that we have in the stores coming weren't very favorable. The thing about that business that -- if you're in any other business inside of our building that you got to be envious about would be is productivity per foot is very impressive and they do very well and that's a big driver of that is because of their product and their marketing is their cross-sells [ph] are very impressive. And they do a very good job of that as a business. And I look at it and go, well, we brought some value and advantages to this team, this company and brand that we brought into the fold a couple of years ago. At the same time, they're bringing a lot of lessons to us here at Gap Inc.

But it's a combination of our corporate-owned business, our very strong and exciting franchise business that grew at 30% in the first quarter and now with global online and global outlet. So we're looking at it this way, we're saying, look, we take the mix but we also look at every country. It's such a broad statement as you can appreciate it, calling it International business -– we have a European business and we're watching very carefully. Our team there in Europe knows that. They're making all the right decisions, whether it's hunkering down when they have to hunker down, making sure the stores that are strong for us, especially in big centers like London and Paris and Milan and Rome, that those stores are strong and out there winning, there's -- they're in difficult conditions in Europe. Now we go sort of around the world and look at our business in Japan, which in the quarter, we had to live with the -- about 6 weeks of the anniversary of the tragedy of 3/11 and then 6 weeks of some recovery. And we do feel really good in Japan otherwise, about our business in general but our team there and about the prospects to putting online more outlet stores and introduce Old Navy. China, we've committed ourselves to 30 stores this year. We're on track. We did 7 stores in the quarter, which was a nice number for us. That's good. Usually, you don't see front-end loaded real estate as I mentioned in my opening comments and our franchise business of 30% comp was -- sorry, 30% total sales was very strong. So was our -- we don't release this  numbers, but our global online business was also very powerful in the first quarter. We really like what we saw in our International markets and in China, that's why we're looking forward to Japan. Now when it comes to Old Navy Japan, not to get into too many details, but I think one thing I would like people to appreciate is, because it's a value business similar to our outlet business, really, what you're looking at here is a push model. So we're -- the Old Navy team in Mission Bay, yes, there's a nice collaboration with a very, very small focus team in Japan who's going to do the execution. But really, we're pushing out the product, the marketing, the store design, the standards, the operating model. It's all based on how Old Navy operates here today. That's been pushed out into the Japanese team, and there's a great team there that are going to help execute it, working in conjunction with the team here in North America. But a different completely different model than Gap, which we've been working since I've been here to sort of undo a little bit and get to more consistency and continuity around the world, which a big part of that was opening the global center in New York was to get to that. Old Navy started from day 1, we're going to model it more off our very successful global outlet business and have a team here in San Francisco be pushing out and let the Japan team execute it with very little -- I want to be clear on this, very little localization. There'll be some, and we did all our research here. We've talked to so many of our customers and so much research like we did in China that Old Navy, the way it's positioned here in North America, will work very well in Japan. That's why there's very little localization."

But also I would say that we want to make sure that we also shift the mix of our customers. And as we look at our range of sort of age demographic, business these days is so much more about just age demographic but to be only on that measurement, we do believe there's an opportunity for more customers in the mid, late 20s, early 30s to be experiencing the brand, checking it out. People who may be we've not been as relevant and appealing to in the last number of years to get them to come in to see Gap. Now fortunately for us, a nice trend came by in the early part of this year which really could appeal to a very democratic group of customers, but maybe, especially was appealing to people in the age group I just mentioned. So the marketing as you saw was attempted not only in the marketing and the creative that was done from Seth's team and the agency, but also in the medium I would say that the local marketing teams and the global team are choosing to speak to our customers. So I'm actually quite pleased with a little bit of research I've seen. It is early days that were there's some new customers in the quarter? Absolutely. But I'm really -- what I'm digging deep into -- since I know Art in North America in particular, is digging deep into is what kind of mix of customers is he getting?

And so our programs just sort of didn't catch up with that level of movement, let's say. But we're obviously, long-term believers in our stock and nothing's changed with regard to our philosophy of distributing that excess cash. So share repurchase is embedded in our overall spectrum of scenarios and our guidance. I think it's just important once again to factor in that it -- the timing matters.

How is the team thinking about replicating that online experience inside the store or presenting the collection in person? And then I also had a separate question just regarding the competitive landscape. It seems like we came from a Q4 timeframe when there was a lot of excess inventory in the marketplace and perhaps a lack of fashion trends to excite consumers to now a complete reversal in Q1. How do you view the competitive environment as we go into Q2 and how is the team kind of executing against that going to the second half as well?"

On Piperlime, look, I'd say in some ways, we're taking a little bit of the blueprint from Athleta. Now they're different businesses for sure. In the Athleta, purpose for doing stores was so -- such a strong call from our customers who bought on catalog and online, but the nature of that product, they really wanted the opportunity to physically experience the brand and try that product on because it's so technical. And the customers, they are going after, well, they really love the online experience and were inspired from the catalog, they really wanted a physical manifestation of the brand. Well, we've taken that blueprint for Piperlime and so it's tough. If we were steady right now in September in SoHo, I could articulate to you how that 4,500 square foot store is going to come across. But I actually think, as pleased as I was because we have a central team that does design. As I'm pleased with that team -- central team on store design that came up with the magic to how to translate Athleta from an online business to bricks-and-mortar off-line business. I really believe that team is going to do the exact same thing for Piperlime. Now it's one store, right? So nobody's going to get excited. It's just we're going to do one store and whether there's another store from there or not, we'll figure it out. But it's something that our customers, given that target for Piperlime I've asked for, I think we should try it. Now we did this for Athleta, thinking more than Piperlime. We could see some kind of rollout that was more what's the number, how big it could be, given -- because it's a different business. But here I think we're going to find out whether it ends up being just a phenomenal marketing vehicle, so be it. If it ends up something greater than that, they can have commercial success, we'll look at it. This will -- I won't know that answer from another year from today. Now what it comes to the competitive landscape, I'm not sure as much if it is the trends that is affecting the competitive landscape. It's obviously, still highly competitive out there but how our teams are thinking about it and I'm saying this a little bit to Brian. This investment in marketing to be determined what level and to what pace we're going to keep it going. But the intention behind that at Banana Republic, online -- Banana Republic a lot of direct-mail. Online, obviously, some investments and online media for the total brand for online business and for our store business and the out-of-home marketing we're doing for Gap brand. The intention behind that is to really showcase the brand and get excited behind the product and the positioning of those 2 businesses. And because of that, we hope and we saw that in the first quarter where we become less reliant on some of the promotions that all of us got caught up to starting in the summer of 2008. So I'm thinking maybe you're correct, I need a little bit of the trend, maybe a little bit that the consumer conditions are slightly better than a year ago. They're not great but slightly better than a year ago. And some unique marketing and I would say traffic driving initiatives that each brand is digging, look at Old Navy they're doing something called Super C-A-S-H, which is a bounce back program, which is very successful for them, that reduces their dependency on just traditional promotional needs. So all of our teams are thinking, one, creatively; secondly, they’re always thinking about the customer and what the brand stands for, for them; and thirdly, which matters most to me, how do I win and beat the competition through great ways of getting people across our lease line at a value proposition that fit each one of our brands."

So I came in",601,"On the marketing, as I mentioned on the call, how I think about it, I guess, across the brands, I mean, we came into the year feeling actually pretty good because we put a lot of time on product and on marketing platforms in the fall of 2011. So I came in thinking for the first time since I've been leading the business, we've had a clear sense of our product direction. And therefore, I would feel more confident I haven't decided yet how much marketing to put into each one of our businesses, but I felt more confident than I felt it a long time, putting marketing behind the direction and what I believe to be the sustainable direction. It's not just a onetime quarter, we're hoping our -- that our teams who've worked really hard, design teams, our merchant teams really get the clearer view now of long-term momentum sustainable great product inside of our stores. So the marketing, whether it's the platform I talked about earlier on Be Bright, whether it's the versatile new work at Banana Republic, whether it's Funnovations Inc. with the key focus there being on fun and expression of value at Old Navy, I actually think that our marketing has delivered for us in the first quarter. And no different than product. The marketing teams know that we expect benefit, we expect traffic, we expect a step up in relevance. Because otherwise, why put the money forward? And that's one of the key components for us. Now focus on Old Navy. Old Navy is a brand and a value sector. It's a huge competitive advantage. So they have to continue to feed marketing. They have plenty of marketing from last year's. It's not -- it's not any fresh marketing going into Old Navy. They have plenty of marketing from Elway. Their issue is just continue to do the right kind of marketing and the right kind of messaging to build on that differentiation of being a brand in the value sector. Now in the product and price, which we all -- obviously all, you including Dana, the industry call what's our value proposition, look, I believe the company, because of the unique year in 2011, may have gotten off what I thought was a very good pricing architecture, value proposition in 2010. Now there was unique circumstances. But we've already had our moment where we said we made some mistakes in 2011 by not staying true to a value proposition and pricing architecture, that workforce in 2010. So it wasn't very difficult to go back because the competitive landscape is not such a change for us that anyone of our brands would have to dramatically shift the architecture and the value proposition in 2010. We just got to tweak it. And I think that I've been part of meetings with the teams because that's something I get involved with, when it comes to the brands. And I do believe there's always work. This is not a static moment. It's fluid. But the work I've seen done so far, what I want to throw -- in fairness, I want to throw our outlet business in there, too, which is a very important pricing architecture and their promotional positioning. But I look at all of those businesses including online, I think some very good decisions are being made. But I expect them, one, to stay highly competitive to know exactly who they're up against, where their share needs to come from and make sure they protect their value proposition going forward, while making good intelligent decisions."

As has been customary in the last number of calls, I'm going to provide some color on the performance in the second quarter and then I'm going to hand over to Sabrina, who will take you through a much more detailed review financially. In the second quarter, there was a lot of bright spots inside the business that we feel good about. There's been a lot of effort, a lot of energy being directed to get us to where we are today. I think the best thing for me to do is maybe take you through some of those bright spots and give you my sense of what we're doing and to give you a little more information behind the P&L.
So let's start with sales, which was very positive in the second quarter. We had a 4 comp, that was made up by our 3 North American brands, 7% comp in Gap North America, 7% Banana Republic and 3% comp in Old Navy. And that's the second quarter in the row where the disbursement of our comp was very much driven almost equally across all 3 of the brands. That's very positive. When that happens, our business does very well, as you can see by the $0.49 earnings per share the company accomplished. Now there are a number of reasons why our business has been consistently positive for the first half of this year. Number one reason is product. And there's been a lot of focus, a lot of effort starting late last year with our product teams. And I'm really proud of the work they've done in the first half. Whether that's on the right styles, which obviously, we've had great success with so far, particularly in the second quarter. The color trend has been good for the industry, but we've capitalized on it. I think we've really focused on fit and consistency of fit and our scores on that front are improving into the second quarter. And lastly, we've made these targeted investments in key categories, categories where we want to dominate, where we want to win. And those are our product assets. We put the money behind those assets. Our customers are noticing it. The second thing when it comes to sales is I think we're flowing our product in a much more seasonally correct way. One thing that I've always been frustrated about is that July and January in particular, have never been our best months. I think the teams are doing a much better job of reacting to that and putting in seasonally, more correct product that customers want in our stores this past month.
And lastly, I'm going to take my hat off to our store teams. Our store execution in the second quarter was very good. I saw a lot of stores in the second quarter. I saw not only the enthusiasm behind our store associates but I think the standards, the execution, the visual merchandising, the windows were all a step above. That's been a big contributor to the company's performance on sales.
Gap Inc. Direct was up 24%. That obviously, helps when you look at a 4 comp in the second quarter. That was a good performance by that team. And the only thing that we're focusing on is our traffic was negative. And we know for the business to fire in all cylinders, without only need to have AUR happening store execution, the right product investments but we need to have positive traffic. We have seen some further focus in that area in the second half of 2012.
Now we did end strongly, which I felt great about. When I was a 10 comp in July, it's been a long time since we've had double-digit comp like that. The calendar shift helped a little bit, we're a very holiday-driven business, so many outlet stores in Old Navy. Regardless of that, a 10 comp was a very nice way to end the quarter. Now next I want to talk about is our International business. We had a minus 5 comp in Q2. And they expected and we expected a better business. Let me give you a little further color behind that minus 5 performance. Now it's obviously, difficult in Europe right now. And what we feel good about our actual store distribution in the European market is we're very concentrated in key cities: London, Paris, Milan and Rome, is a big percentage of our European business. As Europe begins the recovery at some point in the future, I think we're positioned properly by being much more dominant in those key cities.
In Japan, this was the first full quarter that anniversaried the disaster of 3/11 and us, like other Japanese retailers were clearing through spring and summer product as traffic dropped significantly in the Japanese market. So we are up against that very aggressive clearance quarter. And I believe that, that will be behind us more in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. We have expectations of a better performance in Japan in the second half. And China's too small right now to be material to our comp number. Our total sales in the second quarter were up 6%. International business was up 7%. So even though the comp was negative, total sales were up 7% internationally.
Our Franchise business up 25%, continues to grow from the strength. Athleta opened 11 stores. I'm going to pause for a second. That's just a really good number for a young team to execute and deliver. There's a lot of stores this summer. I think the store teams have executed well and customers are responding very positively to have a physical presence of the brand in their neighborhood. Our global outlet business added 10 stores in the second quarter, that contributed to the 2% spread. And lastly, we opened up our first Old Navy store outside of North America in Tokyo.
I was there the week after it opened, I was really impressed, not only by how well we translated the brand into a whole new market but the response of customers and families in particular, which is the cornerstone of the Old Navy brand was great to see when I was in Tokyo. So that will lay a nice groundwork. We're testing ideas, we're trying different things but I think that sets us up nicely for the rollout of Old Navy in Japan in 2013.
From a margin perspective, we had a very nice lift in the second quarter. We're working aggressively on ticket integrity, selling product at full regular price. I think that's been helpful to us. That doesn't just happen through a great product although that's the initial first driver. It happens first in the store, how our store associates sell it, what goes in the window. It also helps with the marketing investments we are making, we are creating demand on the first day that either shows up online or shows up in the store. And this was the first quarter since late 2011 where our average unit cost, our cost of goods, were not significantly above the year before and that contributed to the performance.
As a business, we are still very committed to making the right thoughtful investments in our SG&A line, one is marketing. And Gap North America has been receiving some incremental marketing in the first half of this year, driving the Be Bright campaign. That has had really good feedback, whether it's online we've heard through social media or in our stores, the campaign is resonating. Our digital investment, like other retailers, we're putting money behind digital, whether that's online marketing or other tools, we understand where customer are shopping, we understand where they're getting their information. We've done some very good work on that front. And lastly, some money has gone into the store labor. We've got some service models we're looking at, selectively in key stores. We're testing some ideas, as I think there's an investment there in the second quarter that helped. And in closing, when you perform and deliver $0.49 in earnings per share over last year's $0.35, a 40% increase in EPS, of course, I think overall, people here are energized. It's a good feeling inside the business. But what I have to do is make sure that every stays focus and that's what's critical. It's what got us through this performance, let's just keep doing that and keep repeating it. I mentioned on these calls before the last fall was an important moment in the company. To make sure that Gap Inc. comes out strong at the beginning of 2012 and that's what we've done.
We know that sustained performance is what matters and everybody here is working hard every single day to make sure we maintain the momentum in the back half that we enjoyed in the first half of 2012. So with that said, let me hand over to Sabrina, who will take you through the financial results of Q2 2012. Sabrina?"

Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights. Consistent with the first quarter, net sales were up 6%. Comparable sales were up 4% and our North American divisions again, each posted positive comps. Operating margin was up 200 basis points. Earnings per share grew 40%. And in addition, we generated strong free cash flow and returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the second quarter, operating income was up $91 million or 27%. Net earnings were up $54 million and earnings per share were $0.49, up from $0.35 last year.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Second quarter total sales were $3.6 billion, up 6% with comp sales up 4%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 14% to $1.4 billion. Second quarter gross margin was up 300 basis points to 39.9%. Our merchandise margins were up 210 basis points, driven by the combination of growth in average unit retail and decreases in average unit cost. Rent and occupancy leveraged 90 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As foreshadowed in our July sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 6% on last year's up 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We've noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses in 2012, and highlighted that it's likely well deleverage operating expense. In line with that framework, second quarter total operating expenses were approximately $1 billion, up $85 million from the prior year. The increases were focused on our Gap Inc. Direct division, which grew sales 24% in the quarter, as well as marketing and store payroll investments across our other channels.
Marketing expenses grew $33 million to $147 million, with the biggest increase driven by Gap brand's investment in windows, outdoor and digital media.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Second quarter capital expenditures were $149 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we opened 9 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,035 stores. Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q2 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $673 million, and we ended the second quarter with about $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the second quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares for $349 million at an average price of $26.65.
We ended the quarter with 479 million shares outstanding. And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year.
Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress during the first half of the year, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per, which includes the 53rd week to $1.95 to $2. In addition, we are increasing our full-year operating margin guidance from about 10% to about 11%. As a reminder, it's our objective to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins. A few things to keep in mind regarding our margins. While our average unit costs are improving in the back half versus 2011, they are not back to 2010 levels. It's also important to remember that in each quarter of 2011 and through Q1 of 2012, our average unit retails grew as we decreased units in the face of escalating product costs. Therefore, our plan to introduce more unit inventory in the second half of 2012 primarily at Old Navy, may cause our average unit retail growth to slow compared to the first half of the year.
Regarding inventory, although we plan to add units during the second half because the cost of each unit is lower, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q3 are expected to be down in the low-single-digits to last year.
Regarding operating expenses. Given the progress we've made on our product, as evidenced by customer response year-to-date, we believe it's prudent to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Specifically, we expect the increased over last year in operating expense in each of the remaining quarters to be at least as large as it was in the second quarter. As a result, we continue to expect to deleverage operating expense in the second half.
Moving on to cash. Our principles remain intact. Our stated priorities for the uses of cash are first, to reinvest in our business to the degree we have projects that will deliver appropriate returns and second, to distribute excess cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the improvement in our operating performance, we are increasing our full-year capital guidance and are comfortable spending up to $675 million versus our previous guidance of about $600 million. Consistent with our strategy, the increase will be focused on remodels that the company store consolidations and downsizes, as well as other store related projects. We also plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we've consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012.
Finally, we plan to repay our $360 million term loan. This repayment, which has no prepayment penalty, will eliminate negative spread and further support our investment grade rating.
The following full year guidance metrics remains unchanged. Net square footage down by about 1%, company-operated stores, net of repositions, about 130 openings and about 115 closures; depreciation and amortization, about $475 million; effective tax rate about 39.5%. In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategies during the first half of the year and our focus on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

The news within that 30 store profile is that we're going to open up in 5 new cities, so we'll be in 10 cities at the end of the year, which is sort of part of our real estate strategy was to go into Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong. And then last year, we opened up in 2 other cities which we're -- and Hong Shou, and we'll be in 5 cities by the end of this year, such news worthy because it allows us to answer your question actually, Barbara, which is, I'm not saying anybody but brands, if you have a brand positioning globally, you can go into Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, and you can likely carve yourself up a decent-sized business. But to find out how big can China become, given the fact that it's the second biggest market for apparel in the world, just has Japan about 12 months ago, we decided to go with it and make sure how well can we perform, again to your point on productivity, on return on capital, on sort of overall sales. How can we do in markets that we're going to need to get into and penetrate and be successful in order to have a meaningful business. So that's important for us to learn that. Second thing we did with online day 1, which we'll have our second anniversary this November. That was also important to find out how the Chinese consumers buy online. Because it's different than it is here in the U.S. and that's not uncommon. A lot of countries be online penetration, the reception of it can be different. We've been very pleased with our online business. That's good to our overall strategy. And the third leg to answer your question in the future is we're opening 3 outlet stores this year. And I was actually just in China and I was really impressed, I did outlet centers before, but I saw our 2 stores, 2 of the 3 that are under construction and the quality of the sites, the quality of the cotenancy which is really good for us, you're talking about Coach and Nike and people who we actually have a nice cotenancy relations with here in the U.S. So I think I was impressed with that. So the answer we'll know probably a little bit more at our Analyst Meeting next year. We'll be able to figure out more but our strategic plan for China where that's going to go, but I've always been a believer that, that was a great market for us because of our multiple brands, which we've not decided yet beyond Gap, we're going to do anything. The only decision we've made so far is one brand with multiple channels. But I always felt good about the market because of the American component of our brands and how well that resonates with Chinese consumers. And the last part would be that we do very well in our marketing of skewed towards the millennials here in North America and the version that in China is the golden generation. And I think our marketing, our positioning, what we stand for, what this company believes and those brands -- our brand so far has done very well. So more to come but we're off to a very good start."

It's in the product side, which is if you add together the amount of money that Sabrina and I were comfortable with our brand presence this year, we're investing in 2012 given one, a sort of stepped-up level of confidence. We're nowhere near where we want to be, but we start feeling more comfortable last fall as we look towards the spring and what our teams were able to get done in some of the changes we obviously, made to get the confidence we started to feel internally last fall. But starting with the product piece, that's the larger amount of the reinvestments we're making in this product. We saw some in the spring and we were able in the spring to get an early read and we have ways these days to get an earlier read than we used to. So I would say that, that encouraged us to continue on the same path, maybe a bit of a step up in investment in the third quarter product and the fourth quarter will be about the same as the third quarter. So the majority of this if you talked to our teams and you've heard me say this before but it's always worth repeating, to me, the success ultimately of us selling products at full price and driving the kind of AUR performance that we believe we need to have inside this business given our brands starts with having the right styles. And that's the long story of our design team. And having the right color, that's in spite of the move towards the color trend this year. We were not happy with the colors we put forward last year. So style, color, fit is critical, which again, our design team and our production team owns. And there were some decisions made on categories that we want to be more dominant in. I've listed some in the past. In Gap, it's be dominant in babyGap, be dominant in denim, that's important for obviously, Banana Republic its ensuing it's in woven shirts. But taking out some of those categories that we can go out and we can give them the space beneath because breaking up with an investment in quality, that should come back with an investment in inventory, which should come with an investment in the space in the store, which should come with an investment of the service model inside the store, and lastly, investment in marketing. So what we've been working on since last fall is the continuum of that, taking the product asset in each one of our brands and not just putting quality for the sake of putting quality because in some cases, that could be money unnecessarily being spent. Being disciplined on how we do it that take it all the way that continuum I just took you through. So I'd say, the difference you'll see in fall and holiday versus spring and summer, is some decisions we made on categories that we're able to chase into or some speed categories where we still think there's an opportunity to ultimately get the goal here is to drive our value proposition, which is not overpaying for quality. So putting the quality where makes sense, making sure the right ticket price and driving right price sales. On marketing, early days. I made -- I mentioned in my opening comments that if there's a metric that Sabrina and I are staring at and going, we'd like to see a little more of that is traffic. And there's no need to unnecessarily beat ourselves up over 40% increase in EPS, but we are always looking for the next opportunity. So the marketing piece and I'm sure people have heard this maybe from other retailers, as you shift your business model ever so slightly, we're still going to offer value, we're still going to have promotions, that's important, particularly in Old Navy and in our outlet business. But as we shift to marketing, what is acceptable lag effect until that pool of traffic gets replenished maybe its a better quality of full of traffic. So Sabrina and I are working with the brand presence. We make sure those investments first of all, is good quality marketing. In the past, where we have not spent money in marketing because we weren't happy with it. And marketing leaders know that if we're happy with the marketing and it makes sense, and it's going to drive traffic and it's going to inspire customers, we'll put the money behind that. So I think the Gap will continue to be, I'd say the focus in the back half, gap brand, mostly North America. As Barbara asked earlier, China will continue to be our focus, as it takes a long time to build you brand in China. And maybe its a little smaller but still important, Athleta as we start to build that brand with the stores out, after all, physical store is a manifestation of the marketing investment to create the brand. So back half, we're committed to it. First call in February, we said we'd take it quarter by quarter. But now that we've seen -- and we look at a lot of research besides traffic, we're feeling comfortable about the back half, about some investments in marketing. And the labor piece. That one I tried to say in the opening call, it's really just some test we're doing right now in our labor modeling. We made some tough decisions on labor during the height of the recession in 2008, 2009. And we know that ultimately, our store environment, our store experience is critical. So whether that's the capital investments we're making the right ones, but also labor investments. I would say that's more predominant inside of Banana Republic and Gap, and more predominant inside big markets. So you look at the top 10 DMAs, you look at those 2 big brands, and that's where the labor test and trying to step up our service model is taking place."

I'm trying to keep it short because of obviously, for the company to step up and hire somebody as impressive as Stefan, from such a company that we respect like H&M, because we do believe, multiple meetings with him in the spring before we made the decision he was going to join us. We like how he was thinking about retail, about product, about winning and what he's done in the past and his global experience. So as I said in the previous call, we're just very excited for him to join us in October. In advance of him joining us, I'll get back to him in a second, I'm quite pleased with what Nancy Green and Tom Sands [ph] have done. You've got to give them credit. A lot of times at retail, when a leaves, businesses tend to sort of stay status quo and some cases even flounder because leadership changes can be impactful on a brand. So kudos to them. We might stepped in to help out as much as I can, but they really led that business and that team. I'd say the thing that they've been doing in, is I think that they've been really cleaning up and keeping the business simple because, I'm a big fan of taking on new initiatives in the business and at times it may take on a little bit too much and Old Navy is cleaning that up. They've got very, very focused on 3 initiatives, that's all they talk about, I'm not going to share those over the phone but those 3 key focuses, that whole business had and that's what they brought. Another thing I will add, I believe our agency and our marketing team, which right now, Michelle Demartini, is overseeing for us, she's one of our most senior merchant. Our marketing at Old Navy, which I love the positioning of the brand we've talked about, that has not changed since I've been here, but the new platform and how to communicate the voice of the brand has really been good. I've been pleased. Since June, you've seen their business, and I think that's helping their business quite a bit, I mean obviously, it starts with product like any other brand, but more than any other band, I think their marketing has really resonated with their customers and I've been very happy with that. What's Stefan is going to do it's -- I said, in fairness to him, he said many, many months to think about it but until he gets here and meets the team and works with them and figures out what he believes strategically, he's going to do matches up with what's the team is able to get done it's a little too soon to tell. I do know, just an appropriate form to share it with you, I do know what his vision is, having talked to him back in May, obviously, he's away from us till October. But the last time I talked to him, whatever it was 6 months ago, 4 months ago, I know that he definitely has a vision of what he wants to. So we'll see how that plays out and translates inside of our business. But I want to make sure one thing is important to me to make clear. He's coming into the business was not driven by the most recent global ambitions we have for the brand. That's a given. I mean, we opened a number of countries at H&M obviously, their a global retailer like Gap is, a global brand that is. So that I think is icing on the cake. I believe he's going to come in with a very strong perspective and position when it comes to product. That's what he knows having worked in that business. So that's not taking Old Navy to H&M because he's understand the difference. But I believe he's going to really help us between the design conceptually, through the merchandising, to the process, to the cost part all the way to in-store execution. I think that -- that part of Old Navy he is going to be super strong at and the global piece will come over time, including our one store in Japan. I think that's going to be a nice story to talk about into, 3, 4 years from now."

I'd say the first one, Randy, is something I -- to be repetitive, as what I said to John, I think the traffic number was a number -- I'm not here to rank necessarily all the metrics in order to -- you know the company and a lot of people in the phone do, we're never really happy. And I think that our team has definitely embraced that sentiment. This is a quarter where we celebrate a few small wins and we have some small wins that the team have executed well. We're particularly pleased as I said with my opening comments, coming off last year where we were not at all happy with the business, even though there was some circumstances outside of our control, we just weren't happy. Traffic is a number that we would prefer to not see negative. It's a number that we do look at holistically between our specialty business, our outlet business, and our online business. If you look at it holistically, it's probably a different picture. But at the end of the day, our store traffic being negative in the quarter is something that all of our teams, our store leaders, our brand presidents all know that in order to be happy as a business, we'd like to see all our metrics and positive territory with the with the exception of AUC. Such as the way we have to start looking at the business and -- but we also know that businesses comp is an outcome, what -- how you get to comp is by taking certain strategies and really trying to take them deep. So this is just hypothetical but maybe one brand is working more on AT, one brand is working more on unites per transaction, one brand maybe working more on AUR. They have to pick the metric that supports their overall strategies and as long as the key metrics they're trying to move in a positive direction to get to an outcome like comp, is the framework of their performance is meeting what they tell us they're going to do then Sabrina and I are happy. But yes, we're always looking for -- knowing this business as well as I do now, comping from obviously, different industries, what I do know as a metric that is going very well for you for a period of time, would be foolish to count on it for a number of years. So you always have to make sure there's other metrics that could get to the outcome of comp that you're putting plans in place to strengthen them. As one of the outcomes we're trying to get to your second question can we grow long-term, its obviously, our goal. When I think of growth, one thing I do want to put forward, only because it's a number I asked Katrina for the other day is in Q2 2011, we had 163 more stores than we do today. I mean, we closed 163 stores between Q2 '11 and Q2 '12. When you think of growth, I always think comp is a metric that everybody should look at. But I'm all about top line sales. So that's a number we said publicly that we're closer to the end of our real estate strategy which involves closing down square footage at a time necessary, consolidation from, kids and babyGap into Adult, and also closing stores. We've done more. We have more to do but we've done more in the last 3 years. We're closer to the end of the beginning. That will certainly help top line growth. And that's a number that's important to me. Comp plus spread equals total sales. I have huge appreciation for comp, I've always been about top line sales. So I think growth, I think will look more promising in the future when we get to the end of executing our real estate strategy. And lastly, Athleta, you heard me pause on my opening comments, I mean, 11 stores in one quarter to a team that 18 months ago didn't have a store, it's pretty impressive when you think about it. I mean, some people obviously, open 150, 200 stores in the quarter but for that team to come where they've come and I've been to a lot of real estate to hear the comments from customers in particular who wanted a physical manifestation of that brand, I'm very proud of that team in -- and led by Scott Key. They've done a great job, this is early days what I would tell you in the spring of what our plans for 2013, but we will open our 25 stores in 2012. Feel good about it right now. Great customer response and I think that they think and I'm more willing to support them than not, although it's early days, they feel they're guided tighter by the tail. And let them feel that way, nothing wrong with a  little bit of confidence from our latest brand. What more to talk about from Athleta in our meetings in the spring."

And they have great customer connections whether that's through e-mails or through some of the partnerships they've done. So I think the marketing there, which is not a big driver of this increase in our SG&A but they are getting a little bit more marketing than they have in the past, and they're making good use of it. And what we don't talk about and that's -- I think everybody on the phone always wants to focus on our specialty business, particularly Gap, which I understand. But the product improvement at the -- in the outlet channel has been equal -- about a minimum equal, if not something you'll argue better but the step up in the product and the investments, what they've done there has been great. Very, very impressed, I mean those stores a lot, in Friday some of them. So those merchant teams, those marketing teams under that leadership of a channel which we feel we have a competitive advantage in. We will continue to drive globally is nothing short of impressive. So that's -- it's good to see, and we have high expectations for them going forward. But they're off also to a very good start so far this year."

Let's see what transpires in the fall and holiday. I think that the messaging, how it resonates, how well the creative is showing the product, is back to what I said earlier if we're making an investment in product, it has to have a follow-up investment in store space, in service model and ultimately marketing has to show the investments you're making in your product. I think the Old Navy team has done a really good job on that as well as our agency. So maybe one last week but I think it's better quality of marketing that we're putting out there. And just saw the holiday and the Thanksgiving ideas the team has and I actually feel really good about it. It's a lot of work still to be done, but they put forward not only good Q3 ideas but the early ideas behind Q4, certainly motivate me to make sure that their spends stays at a minimum equal to last year.

We're being very effective and digital's been a great medium for us like our new marketing team. Our team here in San Francisco, our teams around the world and our team -- teams in New York really have embraced digital and if you can great content and use digital, I think that, that can be very effective too.

I think I",858,"Okay. It seems to be the day of 3 questions. So on the first one, what I do feel good about is that the stepped-up performance in our top line sales for the most part has been driven by the categories we identified to make some reinvestments in. I think I was giving my theory on comp earlier, the same thing applies to product. Comp is an outcome. If you have a 4 comp like we did in the second quarter across our multiple brands, that was a 7 in Gap, a 7 in Banana Republic, a 3 in Old Navy, let's just take that Banana Republic for now. So you have a 7 comp, to get to that, the team has to plan certain categories, they really believe in what to invest and all the reasons I gave earlier, trying to get a 10 comp in that business, a 12 comp because if you try to get everything at a 7, you're going to make some mistakes and the outcome will not be a 7. So what I do like about the business so far is whether they decided to stand behind what they believe in, this is not new. We've always had categories who won a competitive advantage and want to be dominant in our competitive set, and want to therefore, to find product assets. Those have not totally changed since I've been here, we've just been more focused on them. And this next slide was putting some money behind it and I think that's really worked out. I think the comp numbers are being driven in a large way by those categories we believe in. Early reads, all of our stores, we don't have a model like some of the other businesses but the early reads with their help us, but we're doing it through social media by getting some early reads on products that's not quite bought, which has been helpful to us, or finding a way as product goes on our online site and earlier and goes on our store, get early reads, we can chase in, that's the most effective form of speed we can do. Early read I -- through again, by crowd sourcing let's call it for lack of a better word and getting some feedback to help us better understand if that's the right product, whether it's a pattern, a print, a color, a style, but really when you get in season that's when I get excited, you get an early read online and read quickly through the fabric platforming we've done to be able to chase back in, in a very short period of time back, back in the goods they're going to be in our stores more than 6 weeks. That's a process that we've been talking about in these calls for a number of years. We slowed speed down last year and chase down because with cotton being so unpredictable, we didn't want to have a change our business model to aggressively 2011 in '12 now, we pushed our teams and they've absolutely embraced the fact that there's a way to get some early reads albeit probably not used in our past and get to react more quickly. So faster pipeline, a speed pipeline and a way to get feedback from either a form of crowd sourcing or from an online channel and then reacting to it much faster than we used to, that's in the early days, But it's helping us. And the last part, the International formats we use, the only thing we've ever said and I don't think we ever changed any market we went corporate in, and we wouldn't change any market we've gone franchising. The only thing we've ever said is as we look forward, are there markets we consider joint venture? We don't want to take that off the table, that might be an option. But in a markets like India, we want to consider that at some point in the future, the only way to go with India right now is through a joint venture. So we're not against that, or our franchisees want to turn it into a joint venture, if there's a franchise opportunity to go to corporate, we're not looking at those today. But I would say as our business continues to evolve and we look at our performance, we don't want to be completely married to the format we have. But there isn't a single decision we made so far, to go franchising in a country that we would ever change. I think everyone of those was a good decisions, and there isn't a single corporate country we went into, we are in today we'd ever turn to franchise. So for the most part, what we've done so far is we're going to stick with. But let's look at the next 2, 3, 4 years and see if there's any change in the franchise relationships we have. I doubt it, but I'm just sort of saying that will be the only way we change any kind of relationship that we currently have in the market."

As has been customary in the last number of calls, I'm going to provide some color on the performance in the second quarter and then I'm going to hand over to Sabrina, who will take you through a much more detailed review financially. 
In the second quarter, there was a lot of bright spots inside the business that we feel good about. There's been a lot of effort, a lot of energy being directed to get us to where we are today. I think the best thing for me to do is maybe take you through some of those bright spots and give you my sense of what we're doing and to give you a little more information behind the P&L.
So let's start with sales, which was very positive in the second quarter. We had a 4% comp, that was made up by our 3 North American brands: a 7% comp in Gap North America, 7% Banana Republic and a 3% comp at Old Navy. And that's the second quarter in a row where the dispersement of our comp was very much driven almost equally across all 3 of the brands. That's very positive. When that happens, our business does very well, as you can see by the $0.49 earnings per share the company accomplished. 
Now there are a number of reasons why our business has been consistently positive for the first half of this year. Number one reason is product, and there's been a lot of focus, a lot of effort starting late last year with our product teams. I'm really proud of the work they've done in the first half, whether that's on the right styles, which, obviously, we've had great success with so far, particularly in the second quarter. The color trend has been good for the industry, but we've capitalized on it. I think we've really focused on fit and consistency of fit, and our scores on that front are improving into the second quarter. And lastly, we've made these targeted investments in key categories, categories where we want to dominate, where we want to win. And those are our product assets. We put the money behind those assets. Our customers are noticing it. 
Second thing when it comes to sales is I think we're flowing our product in a much more seasonally correct way. One thing that I've always been frustrated about is that July and January, in particular, have never been our best months. I think the teams are doing a much better job of reacting to that and putting seasonally, more correct product that customers want in our stores this past month.
And lastly, I'm going to take my hat off to our store teams. Our store execution in the second quarter was very good. There was a lot of stores in the second quarter. I saw not only the enthusiasm behind our store associates, but I think the standards, the execution, the visual merchandising, the windows were all a step above. That's been a big contributor to the company's performance on sales.
Gap Inc. Direct was up 24%. That obviously helps. When you look at our 4% comp in the second quarter, that was a good performance by that team. And the only thing that we're focusing on is our traffic was negative. And we know for the business to fire on all cylinders, we not only need to have AUR happening, store execution, the right product investments, but we need to have positive traffic. You're going to see some further focus in that area in the second half of 2012.
Now we did end strongly, which I felt great about. I mean, that was a 10% comp in July. It's been a long time since we've had a double-digit comp like that. The calendar shift helped a little bit. We're a very holiday-driven business with so many outlet stores at Old Navy. Regardless of that, a 10% comp was a very nice way to end the quarter. 
Next I want to talk about is our International business. We had a minus 5% comp in Q2. And they expected, and we expected, a better business. Let me give you a little further color behind that minus 5% performance. 
Now it's obviously difficult in Europe right now. But what we feel good about our actual store distribution in the European market is we're very concentrated in key cities. London, Paris, Milan and Rome is a big percentage of our European business. As Europe begins a recovery at some point in the future, I think we're positioned properly by being much more dominant in those key cities.
In Japan, this was the first full quarter that anniversaried the disaster of 3/11. And us, like other Japanese retailers, were clearing through spring and summer product as traffic dropped significantly in the Japanese market. So we are up against that very aggressive clearance quarter. And I believe that, that will be behind us more in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. We have expectations that we'll have a better performance in Japan in the second half. And China's too small right now to be material to our comp number. 
Our total sales in the second quarter were up 6%. International business was up 7%. So even though the comp was negative, total sales were up 7% internationally.
Our Franchise business, up 25%, continues to go from strength to strength. Athleta opened 11 stores. I'm going to pause for a second. That's just a really good number for a young team to execute and deliver on. There was a lot of those stores this summer. I think the store teams have executed well, and customers are responding very positively to have a physical presence of the brand in their neighborhood. Our global outlet business added 10 stores in the second quarter. That contributed to the 2% spread. And lastly, we opened up our first Old Navy store outside of North America, in Tokyo. I was there the week after it opened and was really impressed not only by how well we translated the brand into a whole new market, but the response of customers and families, in particular, which is the cornerstone of the Old Navy brand, was great to see when I was in Tokyo. So that will lay a nice groundwork. We're testing ideas, we're trying different things, but I think that sets us up nicely for the rollout of Old Navy in Japan in 2013.
From a margin perspective, we had a very nice lift in the second quarter. We are working aggressively on ticket integrity, selling product at full, regular price. I think that's been helpful to us. That doesn't just happen through a great product, although that's the initial first driver. It happens words in the store or how our store associates sell it and what goes in the window. It also helps that the marketing investments we are making, we are creating demand on the first day. It either shows up online or shows up in the store. And this was the first quarter since late 2011 where our average unit cost, our cost of goods, were not significantly above the year before, and that contributed to the performance.
As a business, we are still very committed to making the right thoughtful investments in our SG&A line. One is marketing. Gap North America has been receiving some incremental marketing in the first half of this year, driving the Be Bright campaign. That has had really good feedback. Whether it's online we've heard through social media or in our stores, the campaign is resonating. Our digital investment, like other retailers, we're putting money behind digital. Whether that's online marketing or other tools, we understand where customers are shopping, we understand where they're getting their information. We've done some very good work on that front. And lastly, some money has gone into store labor. We've got some service models we're looking at selectively in key stores. We're testing some ideas as I think there's an investment there in the second quarter that helped. 
And in closing, when you perform and deliver $0.49 in earnings per share over last year's $0.35, a 40% increase in EPS, of course, I think overall, people here are energized. It's a good feeling inside the business. What I have to do is make sure everybody stays focused. And that's what's critical, was what got us here to this performance. So just keep doing that and keep repeating it. 
We mentioned on these calls before the last fall was an important moment in the company: make sure that Gap Inc. comes out strong at the beginning of 2012. And that's what we've done. But we know that sustained performance is what matters, and everybody here is working hard every single day to make sure we maintain the momentum in the back half that we enjoyed in the first half of 2012. 
So with that said, let me hand over Sabrina, who will take you through the financial results of Q2 2012. Sabrina?"
274265,207066478,347746,"Gap Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2012",2012-08-16,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per sh",1020,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights. Consistent with the first quarter, net sales were up 6%, comparable sales were up 4% and our North American divisions, again each posted positive comps. Operating margin was up 200 basis points. Earnings per share grew 40%. And in addition, we generated strong free cash flow and returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the second quarter, operating income was up $91 million or 27%. Net earnings were up $54 million and earnings per share were $0.49, up from $0.35 last year.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Second quarter total sales were $3.6 billion, up 6% with comp sales up 4%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 14% to $1.4 billion. Second quarter gross margin was up 300 basis points to 39.9%. Our merchandise margins were up 210 basis points driven by the combination of growth in average unit retail and decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 90 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As foreshadowed in our July sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 6% on last year's up 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's likely we'll deleverage operating expense. In line with that framework, second quarter total operating expenses were approximately $1 billion, up $85 million from the prior year. The increases were focused on our Gap Inc. Direct division, which grew sales 24% in the quarter, as well as marketing and store payroll investments across our other channels.
Marketing expenses grew $33 million to $147 million with the biggest increase driven by Gap brand's investment in windows, outdoor and digital media.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Second quarter capital expenditures were $149 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we opened 9 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,035 stores. Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q2 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $673 million, and we ended the second quarter with about $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the second quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares for $349 million at an average price of $26.65. We ended the quarter with 479 million shares outstanding. 
And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. 
Given our progress during the first half of the year, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes a 53rd week, to $1.95 to $2. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 10% to about 11%. As a reminder, it's our objective to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins. 
A few things to keep in mind regarding our margins. While our average unit costs are improving in the back half versus 2011, they are not back to 2010 levels. It's also important to remember that in each quarter of 2011 and through Q1 of 2012, our average unit retails grew as we decreased units in the face of escalating product costs. Therefore, our plan to introduce more unit inventory in the second half of 2012 primarily at Old Navy may cause our average unit retail growth to slow compared to the first half of the year.
Regarding inventory. Although we plan to add units during the second half because the cost of each unit is lower, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q3 are expected to be down in the low single digits to last year.
Regarding operating expenses. Given the progress we've made on our product, as evidenced by customer response year-to-date, we believe it's prudent to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Specifically, we expect the increase over last year in operating expense in each of the remaining quarters to be at least as large as it was in the second quarter. As a result, we continue to expect to deleverage operating expense in the second half.
Moving on to cash. Our principles remain intact. Our stated priorities for the uses of cash are, first, to reinvest in our business to the degree we have projects that will deliver appropriate returns; and second, to distribute excess cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the improvement in our operating performance, we are increasing our full year capital guidance and are comfortable spending up to $675 million versus our previous guidance of about $600 million. Consistent with our strategy, the increase will be focused on remodels that  accompany store consolidations and downsizes, as well as other store-related projects. We also plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, so it's important to note we've consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012.
Finally, we plan to repay our $360 million term loan. This repayment, which has no prepayment penalty, will eliminate negative spread and further support our investment grade rating.
The following full year guidance metrics remain unchanged: net square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores, net of repositions, about 120 openings and about 115 closures; depreciation and amortization, about $475 million; effective tax rate, about 39.5%. 
In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategy during the first half of the year and our focus on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

That's our commitment. The news within that 30-store profile is that we're going to open up in 5 new cities. So we'll be in 10 cities at the end of the year, which sort of part of our real estate strategy was to go into Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong. And then last year, we opened up in 2 other cities, which were Tianjin and Hangzhou, and we're going be in 5 more cities by the end of this year. Such newsworthy because it allows us to answer your question actually, Barbara, which is, I'm not saying anybody, but brands, so if you have a brand positioning globally, you can go into Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong and likely carve yourself up a decent-sized business. But to find out how big can China become given the fact that it's the second biggest market for apparel in the world, just passed Japan about 12 months ago, we decided to go in and make sure how well can we perform. But again, to your point on productivity, on return on capital, on sort of overall sales, how can we do in markets that we're going to need to get into and penetrate and be successful in order to have a meaningful business. So that's important for us to learn that. Second thing we did, we went online day 1, which we'll have our second anniversary this November. That was also important to find out: how would the Chinese consumers buy online because it's different than it is here in the U.S., and that's not uncommon. In a lot of countries, the online penetration, the reception of it, yes, can be different. We've been very pleased with our online business. That's good to our overall strategy. And the third leg, to answer your question, in the future is we're opening 3 outlet stores this year. And I was actually just in China, and I was really impressed. I did outlet centers before, but I saw our 2 stores, 2 of the 3 that are under construction, and the quality of the sites, the quality of the cotenancy, which is really good for us. You're talking about Coach and Nike and people who we actually have nice cotenancy relations with here in the U.S. So I think I was impressed with that. So the answer, we'll know probably a little bit more at our analyst meeting next year. We'll be able at a -- figure out more about our strategic plan for China, where that's going to go. And -- but I'm -- I've always been a believer that, that was a great market for us because of our multiple brands, which we've not decided yet beyond Gap if we're going to do anything. The only decision we made so far is one brand with multiple channels. But I've always felt good about the market because of the American component of our brands and how well that resonates with Chinese consumers. And the last part will be that we do very well, and our marketing has skewed towards the millennials here in North America, and a version of that in China is the golden generation. And I think our marketing, our positioning, what we stand for, what this company believes in those brands -- our brands have -- our brand so far has done very well. So more to come, but we're off to a very good start."

I'd say in the product side, which is -- and you add together the amount of money that Sabrina and I were comfortable, working with our brand presence this year, reinvesting in 2012 given, one, our -- a sort of stepped up level of confidence. We're nowhere near where we want to be, but we'd start feeling more comf [ph] than last fall as we look towards the spring and what our teams were able to get done and some of the changes, obviously, we made to get the confidence we started to feel internally last fall. But starting with the product piece, that's the larger amount of the reinvest we're making in product. You saw some in the spring, and we were able in the spring to get an early read and we have ways these days to get a little earlier read than we used to. So I would say that, that encouraged us to continue on the same path. Maybe a bit of a step-up in investment in the third quarter in product, and the fourth quarter will be about the same as the third quarter. So the majority of this is, if you talk to our teams, and you've heard me say this before but it's always worth repeating, to meet with success ultimately of us selling products at full price and driving the kind of AUR performance that we believe we need to have inside of this business given our brands starts with having the right styles, and that's -- belongs to our design team, and having the right color. That's in spite of the move towards a color trend this year. We were not happy with the colors we put forward last year. So style, color, fit is critical, which, again, our design team and our production team owns. And there were some decisions made on categories that we want to be more dominant in. And I've listed some in the past. In Gap, it's get -- be -- being dominant in babyGap, being dominant in denim. That's important. For, obviously, Banana Republic, it's in suiting, and that's in woven shirts. But taking some of those categories that we can go out and we can give them the space they need because if you're going to put an investment in quality, that should come then with an investment in inventory, which should come with an investment in space in the store, which should come with an investment of the service model inside the store and, lastly, investment in marketing. So what we've been working on since last fall is the continuum of that, taking a product asset in each one of our brands and not just putting quality for the sake of putting quality because, in some cases, that could be money unnecessarily being spent. But being disciplined in how we do it, and then take it all the way that continuum I just took you through. So I'd say the difference you'll see in fall and holiday versus spring and summer is some decisions we made on categories that we're able to chase into or some speed categories where we still think there's an opportunity to ultimately get. The goal here is to drive our value proposition, which is not overpaying for quality. So putting the quality where it makes sense, making sure of the right ticket price and driving right-price sales. Marketing, early days. I made -- I mentioned in my opening comments that if there's a metric that Sabrina and I are staring at and going, ""We'd like to see a little bit more of that"" is traffic. And there's no need to unnecessarily beat ourselves up over 40% increase in EPS, but we are always looking for the next opportunity. So the marketing piece, and I'm sure people have heard this maybe from other retailers, as you shift your business model ever so slightly, we're still going to offer value, we're still going to have promotions. That's important particularly at Old Navy and in our outlet business. But as we shift to marketing, what is the acceptable lag effect until that pool of traffic gets replenished so maybe it's a better quality pool of traffic. So Sabrina and I are working with the brand presence. We'll make sure those investments. First of all, it's good quality marketing. In the past, when we have not spent money in marketing, because we weren't happy with it. And our marketing leaders know that if we're happy with the marketing and it makes sense and it's going to drive traffic and it's going to inspire customers, we'll put the money behind it. So I think the Gap will continue to be, I'd say, the focus in the back half, Gap brand, mostly in North America. As Barbara asked earlier, China will continue to be a focus because it takes a long time to build your brand in China. And maybe it's a little smaller but still important to us is Athleta as we're starting to build that brand and put the stores out. After all, a physical store is a manifestation of the marketing investment to create the brand. So back half, we're committed to it. And look, first call in February, we said we'd take it quarter by quarter. But now that we've seen -- and we look at a lot of research besides traffic. We're feeling comfortable about the back half, about some investments in marketing. And the labor piece. That one, I tried to say in the opening call, it's really just some tests we're doing right now in our labor modeling. We made some tough decisions on labor during the heights of the recession in 2008, 2009, and we know that ultimately, our store environment, our store experience is critical. So whether that's the capital investments we're making, the right ones, but also labor investments, I would say that's more predominant inside of Banana Republic and Gap, and more predominant inside big markets. And so you look at the top 10 DMAs, you look at those 2 big brands, and that's where the labor tests and trying to step up our service model is taking place."

So as I said in the previous call, we're just very excited for him to join us in October. In advance of him joining us, and I'll get back to him in a second, I'm quite pleased with what Nancy Green and Tom Sands have done. You've got to give them credit. A lot of times at retail, when a leader leaves, businesses tend to sort of stay status quo, in some cases even flounder, because leadership changes can be impactful on a brand. And so kudos to them. We might step in to help out as much as I can, but they've really led that business and that team. I'd say the thing that they've been doing is, I think, that they've been really cleaning up and keeping the business simple, because I'm a big fan of taking on new initiatives in the business, and at times, you may take on a little bit too much and Old Navy is cleaning that up. They've gotten very, very focused on 3 initiatives. That's all they talk about. I'm not going to share those on the phone, but just 3 key focuses that whole business had, and that's what they brought. Another thing I will add, I believe our agency and our marketing team, which right now Michelle DeMartini is overseeing for us, she's one of our most senior merchants -- our marketing at Old Navy, which I love the positioning of the brand, we've talked about, but has not changed since I've been here, but the new platform and how to communicate the voice of the brand has really been good. I've been pleased since June. And you've seen their business, and I think that's helping their business quite a bit. I mean, obviously, it starts with product like every other brand. But more than any other brand, I think their marketing has really resonated with their customers, and I've been very happy with that. What's Stefan going to do, it's -- I said I -- in fairness to him, he's had many, many months to think about it, but until he gets here and meets the team and works with them and figures out what he believes strategically, he's going to do matches up with what's -- what the team was able to get done. It's a little too soon to tell. I do know, and I'm -- so just an appropriate forum to share it with you, I do know what his vision is, having talked to him back in may. Obviously, he's away from us till October, but the last time I talked to him, whatever it was, 6 months ago, 4 months ago, I know that he definitely has a vision of what he wants to. So we'll see how that plays out and translates inside of our business. I -- but I want to make sure one thing that's important to me to make clear. His coming into the business was not driven by the most recent global ambitions we have for the brand. That's a given. I mean, he opened in a number of the countries at H&M. Obviously, they're a global retailer like Gap is, a global brand that is. So that, I think, is icing on the cake. I believe he is going to come in with a very strong perspective and position when it comes to product. That's what he knows, having worked in that business. So that's not taking Old Navy to H&M because he's understand the difference. But I believe he's going to really help us between the design conceptually to the merchandising, to the process, to the cost part, all the way to in-store execution. I think that part of Old Navy he is going to be super strong at, and the global piece will come over time. We only got one store in Japan. I think that'll just be a nice story to talk about in 2, 3, 4 years from now."

If there's a -- this is a quarter where we celebrate a few small wins. And we had some small wins, but the team executed well. We're particularly pleased, as I said in my opening comments, coming off last year where we were not at all happy with the business. Even though there was some circumstances outside of our control, we just weren't happy. Traffic is a number that we would prefer to not see negative. It's a number that we do look at holistically between our specialty business, our outlet business and our online business. If you look at it holistically, it's probably a different picture. But at the end of the day, our store traffic, being negative in the quarter, is something that all of our teams, our store leaders, our brand presidents all know that in order to be happy as a business, we'd like to see all our metrics in positive territory with the with the exception of AUC. Such is the way we have to start looking at the business. And -- but we also know that businesses' comp is an outcome. What -- how you get to comp is by taking certain strategies and really trying to take them deep. So this is just hypothetical, but maybe one brand is working more on AT, one brand is working more on units per transaction, one brand maybe working more on AUR. They have to pick the metric that supports their overall strategies. And as long as the key metrics they're trying to move in a positive direction to get to an outcome, like comp, is the framework of their performance, is meeting what they tell us they're going to do, then Sabrina and I are happy. But yes, we're always looking for -- knowing this business as well as I do now, coming from obviously different industries, what I do know as a metric that is going very well for you for a period of time, you'd be foolish to count on it for a number of years. So you always have to make sure there's other metrics that could get to the outcome of comp, that you're putting plans in place to strengthen them. As one of the outcomes, we're trying to get to your second question, can we grow long term. It's obviously our goal. But when I think of growth, one thing I do want to put forward only because it's a number I asked Katrina for the other day, is in Q2 2011, we had 163 more stores than we do today. By that, I mean we closed 163 stores between Q2 '11 and Q2 '12. When you think of growth, I always think comp is a metric that everybody should look at, but I'm all about top line sales. So that's a number we've said publicly that we're closer to the end of our real estate strategy, which involves closing down square footage at a time necessary, consolidation from Kids and baby [indiscernible] Gap into Adult, and also closing stores. We've done more. We have more to do, but we've done more in the last 3 years. We're closer to the end than the beginning. That will certainly help top line growth. And that's a number that's important to me. Comp plus spread equals total sales. While I'm not -- I have huge appreciation for comp, I have always been about top line sales. So I think growth, I think, will look more promising in the future when we get to the end of executing our real estate strategy. And lastly, Athleta, you heard me pause on my opening comments. I mean, 11 stores in one quarter to a team that 18 months ago didn't have a store, it's pretty impressive when you think about it. I mean, some people, obviously, open 150, 200 stores in a quarter, but for that team to come where they've come, and I've been to a lot of real estate to hear the comments from customers in particular who wanted a physical manifestation of that brand, I'm very proud of that team in Petaluma led by Scott Key. They've done a great job. And this is early days. Well, I'd to tell you in the spring about what our plans for 2013, but we will open our 25 stores in 2012. We feel good about it right now. Great customer response. And I think that they think, and I'm more willing to support them than not, although it's early days, they feel they've got a bit of a tiger by the tail. And let's them feel that way. Nothing wrong with a little bit of confidence from our latest brand. We'll have more to talk about from Athleta in our meetings in the spring."

And like I said about the Athleta, we're very pleased and proud of our 2 leaders, Ann Doyle and Andi Owen, who run our 2 factory store outlet businesses. Is the traffic better there than in a specialty store? The answer is yes. So that's why I said earlier that if you take specialty plus outlet, plus online and bring that together as one traffic number, our traffic is actually not that bad. But we have to look at it at channel by channel by channel. And our outlet channel is definitely, the traffic is better. So that's good. I think that's a little bit about the -- just the overall traffic that is in that genre of real estate. But the other thing is our team -- I'm glad you mentioned marketing. Our team is actually -- again, for a team that had no marketing when I started here and don't have a big marketing budget, but they're very, very scrappy and smart about how they spend their marketing, and they have great customer connections, whether that's through emails or through some of the partnerships they've done. So I think the marketing there, which is not a big driver of this increase in our SG&A, but they are getting a little bit more marketing than they have in the past, so they're making good use of it. And what we don't talk about, and that's -- I think everybody on this -- on the phone always wants to focus on our specialty business, particularly Gap, which I understand. But the product improvement at the -- in the outlet channel has been equal, at a minimum equal if not, some feel, they argue, better. But the step-up in the product and the investments, what they've done there, has been great. Very, very impressed. I've been in those stores a lot. I'll be out on Friday in some of them. So those merchant teams, those marketing teams under that leadership of a channel which we feel we have a competitive advantage in, we would -- we will continue to drive globally, is nothing short of impressive. So that's -- it's good to see. And we have high expectations for them going forward, but that's -- they're off also to a very good start so far this year."

But what I'm happy about is that as you put this new platform together, back -- what has it been now, just less than a year, I'm really liking the new creative. So people, which is our core customer, are responding positively to what they've seen over the last couple of months, which I think has really helped our traffic profile. And let's see how -- what transpires in the fall and holiday. I think that the messaging, how it resonates, how well the creative is showing the product, goes back to what I said earlier. If you're making an investment in product, it has to have a follow-up investment in store space, in service model. And ultimately, marketing has to show the investments you're making in your product. And I think Old Navy team has done a really good job of that, as well as our agency. So maybe one last week, but I think it's better quality of marketing that we're putting out there. And I just saw the holiday and the Thanksgiving ideas the team has, and I actually feel really good about it. It's a lot of work still to be done, but they've put forward not only good Q3 ideas, but the early ideas behind Q4 certainly motivate me to make sure that their spend stays, at a minimum, equal to last year.

So on the first one, what I do feel good about is that the stepped up performance in our top line sales, for the most part, has been driven by the categories we identified to make some reinvestments in. I think I was giving my theory on comp earlier. The same thing applies to product. Comp is an outcome. If you're -- if you have a 4% comp, like we did in the second quarter across our multiple brands, that was a 7% in Gap, a 7% in Banana Republic, a 3% at Old Navy, let's just take Banana Republic for now. So you had a 7% comp. To get to that, the team has to plan certain categories they really believe and want to invest with all the reasons I gave earlier to try to get to 10% comp in that business, a 12% comp. Because if you try to get everything at a 7%, you're going to make some mistakes and the outcome will not be a 7%. So what I do like about the business so far is where they decided to stand behind what they believed in. This is not new. We've always had categories we want to have a competitive advantage in, we want to be dominant in our competitive set and want, therefore, to find product assets. Those have not totally changed since I've been here. We've just been more focused on them. And this next slide was putting some money behind it, and I think that's really worked out. And I think the comp numbers are being driven in a large way by those categories we believe in. Early reads, all of our stores, we don't have a model like some other businesses. But the early reads where they help us but we're doing it through social media by getting us some early reads on products that's not quite bought, which has been a helpful tool to us, or finding a way as product goes on our online site earlier and goes on our store, get early reads we could chase in, that's the most effective form of speed we can do. Early read, I [indiscernible] go through again, by crowd sourcing, let's call it for lack of a better word, and getting some feedback to help us better understand if that's the right product, whether it's a pattern, a print, a color, a style. But really, when you get in season, that's when I get excited. You get an early read online and read quickly through the fabric platforming we've done to be able to chase back in a very short period of time back in the goods that are going to be in our store more than 6 weeks. That's a process that we've been talking about in these calls for a number of years. We slowed speed down last year and chased down because with cotton being so unpredictable, we didn't want to have a -- change our business model too aggressively in 2011. In '12 now, we pushed our teams, and they've absolutely embraced the fact that there's a way to get some early reads, albeit probably not used in our past, and get to react more quickly. So faster pipeline, a speed pipeline and a way to get feedback from either a form of crowd sourcing or immediately through an online channel and then reacting to it much faster than we used to. That's in the early days, but it's helping us. The last part, the International formats we use, the only thing we have ever said, and then -- I don't think we ever changed any market we went corporate in, and we wouldn't change any market we've gone franchise in. It's the only thing we've ever said, is as we look forward, are there markets we consider joint venture. We don't want to take that off the table. That may be an option. Look at a markets like India. If we were to consider that at some point in the future, the only way to go with India right now is through a joint venture. So we're not against that if our franchisees wanted to turn it into a joint venture, if there's a franchise opportunity to go to corporate. We're not looking at those today. But I would say as our business continues to evolve and we look at our performance, we don't want to be completely married to the format we have. But there isn't a single decision we've made so far to go franchise in a country that we would ever change. I think every one of those was a good decision, and there isn't a single corporate country we went into -- we are in today we'd ever turn to franchise. So for the most part, what we've done so far is we're going to stick with. But let's look at the next 2, 3, 4 years and see if there's any change to the franchise relationships we have. I doubt it. But I'm just sort of saying that will be the only way we change any kind of relationship that we currently have in a market."

As has been customary in the last number of calls, I'm going to provide some color on the performance in the second quarter and then I'm going to hand over to Sabrina, who will take you through a much more detailed review financially. 
Now the second quarter, there was a lot of bright spots inside the business that we feel good about. There's been a lot of effort, a lot of energy being directed to get us to where we are today. So I think the best thing for me to do is maybe take you through some of those bright spots and give you my sense of what we're doing and to give you a little more information behind the P&L.
So let's start with sales, which was very positive in the second quarter. We had a 4% comp, and that was made up by our 3 North American brands: a 7% comp in Gap North America, 7% Banana Republic and a 3% comp at Old Navy. And that's the second quarter in a row where the disbursement of our comp was very much driven almost equally across all 3 of the brands. That's very positive. When that happens, our business does very well, as you can see by the $0.49 earnings per share the company accomplished. 
Now there are a number of reasons why our business has been consistently positive for the first half of this year. The number one reason is product, and where there's been a lot of focus, a lot of effort starting late last year with our product teams. I'm really proud of the work they've done in the first half, whether that's on the right styles, which, obviously, we've had great success with so far, particularly in the second quarter. The color trend has been good for the industry, but we've capitalized on it. I think we've really focused on fit and consistency of fit, and our scores on that front are improving into the second quarter. And lastly, we've made these targeted investments in key categories, categories where we want to dominate, where we want to win. And those are our product assets. And we’ve put the money behind those assets. And our customers are noticing it. 
Second thing when it comes to sales is, I think we're flowing our product in a much more seasonally correct way. One thing that I've always been frustrated about is that July and January, in particular, have never been our best months. I think the teams are doing a much better job of reacting to that and putting seasonally, more correct product that customers want in our stores this past month.
And lastly, I'm going to take my hat off to our store teams. Our store execution in the second quarter was very good. There was a lot of stores in the second quarter. I saw not only the enthusiasm behind our store associates, but I think the standards, the execution, the visual merchandising, the windows were all a step above. That's been a big contributor to the company's performance on sales.
Gap Inc. Direct was up 24%. That obviously helps. When you look at our 4% comp in the second quarter, that was a good performance by that team. And the only thing that we're focusing on is our traffic was negative. And we know for the business to fire on all cylinders, we not only need to have AUR happening, store execution, the right product investments, but we need to have positive traffic. So you’ll see some further focus in that area in the second half of 2012.
Now we did end strongly, which I felt great about. I mean, that was a 10% comp in July. It's been a long time since we've had a double-digit comp like that. The calendar shift helped a little bit. We're a very holiday-driven business with so many outlet stores and Old Navy. Regardless of that, a 10% comp was a very nice way to end the quarter. 
Next I want to talk about is our International business. We had a minus 5% comp in Q2. And they expected, and we expected, a better business. So let me give you a little further color behind that minus 5% performance. It's obviously difficult in Europe right now. But what we feel good about our actual store distribution in the European market is we're very concentrated in key cities. London, Paris, Milan and Rome is a big percentage of our European business. As Europe begins a recovery at some point in the future, I think we're positioned properly by being much more dominant in those key cities.
In Japan, this was the first full quarter that anniversaried the disaster of 3/11. And us, like other Japanese retailers, were clearing through spring and summer product as traffic dropped significantly in the Japanese market. So we were up against that very aggressive clearance quarter. And I believe that, that will be behind us more in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And we have expectations that we'll have a better performance in Japan in the second half. And China's too small right now to be material to our comp number. 
Our total sales in the second quarter were up 6%. International business was up 7%. So even though the comp was negative, total sales were up 7% internationally.
Our Franchise business, up 25%, continues to go from strength to strength. Athleta opened 11 stores. I'm going to pause for a second. That's just a really good number for a young team to execute and deliver on. I was in a lot of those stores this summer. I think the store teams have executed well, and customers are responding very positively to have a physical presence of the brand in their neighborhood. Our global outlet business added 10 stores in the second quarter. That contributed to the 2% spread. And lastly, we opened up our first Old Navy store outside of North America, in Tokyo. I was there the week after it opened and was really impressed not only by how well we translated the brand into a whole new market, but the response of customers and families, in particular, which is the cornerstone of the Old Navy brand, was great to see when I was in Tokyo. So that will lay a nice groundwork. We're testing ideas, we're trying different things, but I think that sets us up nicely for the rollout of Old Navy in Japan in 2013.
From a margin perspective, we had a very nice lift in the second quarter. We are working aggressively on ticket integrity, selling product at full, regular price. I think that's been helpful to us. That doesn't just happen through a great product, although that's the initial first driver. It happens through words in the store or how our store associates sell it, what goes in the window. It also helps that the marketing investments we are making, we are creating demand on the first day. It either shows up online or shows up in the store. And this was the first quarter since late 2011 where our average unit cost, our cost of goods, were not significantly above the year before, and that contributed to the performance.
As a business, we are still very committed to making the right thoughtful investments in our SG&A line. One is marketing. Gap North America has been receiving some incremental marketing in the first half of this year, driving the Be Bright campaign. That has had really good feedback. Whether it's online we've heard, through social media or in our stores, the campaign is resonating. Our digital investment, like other retailers, we're putting money behind digital. Whether that's online marketing or other tools, we understand where customers are shopping, we understand where they're getting their information. We've done some very good work on that front. And lastly, some money’s gone into store labor. We've got some service models we're looking at selectively in key stores. We're testing some ideas, as I think there's an investment there in the second quarter that helped. 
And in closing, when you perform and deliver $0.49 in earnings per share over last year's $0.35, a 40% increase in EPS, of course, I think overall, people here are energized. It's a good feeling inside the business. What I have to do is make sure everybody stays focused. And that's what's critical, is what got us here to this performance. I just keep doing that. I keep repeating it. 
We mentioned on these calls before, the last fall was an important moment in the company: make sure that Gap Inc. comes out strong at the beginning of 2012. And that's what we've done. But we know that sustained performance is what matters, and everybody here is working hard every single day to make sure we maintain the momentum in the back half that we enjoyed in the first half of 2012. 
So with that said, let me hand over Sabrina, who will take you through the financial results of Q2 2012. Sabrina?"

We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per sh",1020,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights. Consistent with the first quarter, net sales were up 6%, comparable sales were up 4% and our North American divisions, again, each posted positive comps. Operating margin was up 200 basis points. Earnings per share grew 40%. And in addition, we generated strong free cash flow and returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the second quarter, operating income was up $91 million or 27%. Net earnings were up $54 million and earnings per share were $0.49, up from $0.35 last year.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Second quarter total sales were $3.6 billion, up 6% with comp sales up 4%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 14% to $1.4 billion. Second quarter gross margin was up 300 basis points to 39.9%. Our merchandise margins were up 210 basis points driven by the combination of growth in average unit retail and decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 90 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As foreshadowed in our July sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 6% on last year's up 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We’ve noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's likely we'll deleverage operating expense. In line with that framework, second quarter total operating expenses were approximately $1 billion, up $85 million from the prior year. The increases were focused on our Gap Inc. Direct division, which grew sales 24% in the quarter, as well as marketing and store payroll investments across our other channels. Marketing expenses grew $33 million to $147 million, with the biggest increase driven by Gap brand's investment in windows, outdoor and digital media.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Second quarter capital expenditures were $149 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we opened 9 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,035 stores. Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q2 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $673 million, and we ended the second quarter with about $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the second quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares for $349 million at an average price of $26.65. We ended the quarter with 479 million shares outstanding. 
And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress during the first half of the year, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week, to $1.95 to $2. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 10% to about 11%. As a reminder, it's our objective to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins. 
A few things to keep in mind regarding our margins. While our average unit costs are improving in the back half versus 2011, they are not back to 2010 levels. It's also important to remember that in each quarter of 2011 and through Q1 of 2012, our average unit retails grew as we decreased units in the face of escalating product costs. Therefore, our plan to introduce more unit inventory in the second half of 2012 primarily at Old Navy may cause our average unit retail growth to slow compared to the first half of the year.
Regarding inventory. Although we plan to add units during the second half because the cost of each unit is lower, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q3 are expected to be down in the low single digits to last year.
Regarding operating expenses. Given the progress we've made on our product, as evidenced by customer response year-to-date, we believe it's prudent to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Specifically, we expect the increase over last year in operating expense in each of the remaining quarters to be at least as large as it was in the second quarter. As a result, we continue to expect to deleverage operating expense in the second half.
Moving on to cash. Our principles remain intact. Our stated priorities for the uses of cash are, first, to reinvest in our business to the degree we have projects that will deliver appropriate returns; and second, to distribute excess cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the improvement in our operating performance, we are increasing our full year capital guidance and are comfortable spending up to $675 million versus our previous guidance of about $600 million. Consistent with our strategy, the increase will be focused on remodels that accompany store consolidations and downsizes, as well as other store-related projects. We also plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we've consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012.
Finally, we plan to repay our $360 million term loan. This repayment, which has no prepayment penalty, will eliminate negative spread and further support our investment grade rating.
The following full year guidance metrics remains unchanged: net square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores, net of repositions, about 120 openings and about 115 closures; depreciation and amortization, about $475 million; effective tax rate, about 39.5%. 
In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategies during the first half of the year and our focus on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

That's our commitment. The news within that 30-store profile is that we're going to open up in 5 new cities. So we'll be in 10 cities at the end of the year, which sort of part of our real estate strategy was to go into Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong. And then last year, we opened up in 2 other cities, which were Tianjin and Hangzhou, and we're going be in 5 more cities by the end of this year. Such newsworthy because it allows us to answer your question actually, Barbara, which is, I'm not saying anybody, but brands, if you have a brand positioning globally, you can go into Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong and likely carve yourself up a decent-sized business. But to find out how big can China become given the fact that it's the second biggest market for apparel in the world, just passed Japan about 12 months ago, we decided to go in and make sure how well can we perform. But again, to your point on productivity, on return on capital, on sort of overall sales, how can we do in markets that we're going to need to get into and penetrate and be successful in order to have a meaningful business. So that's important for us to learn that. Second thing we did, we went online day 1, which we'll have our second anniversary this November. That was also important to find out: how would the Chinese consumers buy online, because it's different than it is here in the U.S., and that's not uncommon. In a lot of countries, the online penetration, the reception of it, yes, can be different. We've been very pleased with our online business. That's good to our overall strategy. And the third leg, to answer your question, in the future is we're opening 3 outlet stores this year. And I was actually just in China, and I was really impressed. I did outlet centers before, but I saw our 2 stores, 2 of the 3 that are under construction, and the quality of the sites, the quality of the cotenancy, which is really good for us. You're talking about Coach and Nike and people who we actually have nice cotenancy relations with here in the U.S. So I think I was impressed with that. So the answer, we'll know probably a little bit more at our analyst meeting next year. We'll be able at a -- figure out more about our strategic plan for China, where that's going to go. And -- but I'm -- I've always been a believer that, that was a great market for us because of our multiple brands, which we've not decided yet beyond Gap if we're going to do anything. The only decision we made so far is one brand with multiple channels. But I've always felt good about the market because of the American component of our brands and how well that resonates with Chinese consumers. And the last part will be that we do very well, and our marketing has skewed towards the millennials here in North America, and a version of that in China is the golden generation. And I think our marketing, our positioning, what we stand for, what this company believes in those brands -- our brands have -- our brand, so far, has done very well. So more to come, but we're off to a very good start."

I'd say in the product side, which is -- and you add together the amount of money that Sabrina and I were comfortable, working with our brand presence this year, reinvesting in 2012 given, one, our -- a sort of stepped up level of confidence. We are nowhere near where we want to be, but we'd start feeling more comf [ph] than last fall as we look towards the spring and what our teams were able to get done and some of the changes, obviously, we made to get the confidence we started to feel internally last fall. So it starting with the product piece, that's the larger amount of the reinvest we're making in product. You saw some in the spring, and we were able, in the spring, to get an early read and we have ways these days to get a little earlier read than we used to. So I would say that, that encouraged us to continue on the same path. Maybe a bit of a step-up in investment in the third quarter in product, and the fourth quarter will be about the same as the third quarter. So the majority of this is, if you talk to our teams, and you've heard me say this before, but it's always worth repeating, to me the success ultimately of us selling products at full price and driving the kind of AUR performance that we believe we need to have inside of this business given our brands starts with having the right styles, and that's -- belongs to our design team, and having the right color. That's in spite of the move towards a color trend this year. We were not happy with the colors we put forward last year. So style, color, fit is critical, which, again, our design team and our production team owns. And there were some decisions made on categories that we want to be more dominant in. And I've listed some in the past. In Gap, it's get -- be -- being dominant in babyGap, being dominant in denim. That's important. For, obviously, Banana Republic, it's in suiting, and that's in woven shirts. But taking some of those categories that we can go out and we can give them the space they need because if you're going to put an investment in quality, that should come then with an investment in inventory, which should come with an investment in space in the store, which should come with an investment of the service model inside the store and, lastly, investment in marketing. So what we've been working on since last fall is the continuum of that, taking a product asset in each one of our brands and not just putting quality for the sake of putting quality because, in some cases, that could be money unnecessarily being spent. But being disciplined in how we do it, and then take it all the way that continuum I just took you through. So I'd say the difference you'll see in fall and holiday versus spring and summer is some decisions we’ve made on categories that we're able to chase into or some speed categories where we still think there's an opportunity to ultimately get. The goal here is to drive our value proposition, which is not overpaying for quality. So putting the quality where it makes sense, making sure of the right ticket price and driving right-price sales. Marketing, early days. I made -- I mentioned in my opening comments that if there's a metric that Sabrina and I are staring at and going, ""We'd like to see a little bit more of that"" is traffic. And there's no need to unnecessarily beat ourselves up over 40% increase in EPS, but we are always looking for the next opportunity. So the marketing piece, and I'm sure people have heard this maybe from other retailers, but as you shift your business model ever so slightly, we're still going to offer value, we're still going to have promotions. That's important particularly at Old Navy and in our outlet business. But as we shift to marketing, what is the acceptable lag effect until that pool of traffic gets replenished so maybe it's a better quality pool of traffic. So Sabrina and I are working with the brand presence. We'll make sure those investments. First of all, it's good quality marketing. In the past, when we have not spent money in marketing, because we weren't happy with it. And our marketing leaders know that if we're happy with the marketing and it makes sense and it's going to drive traffic and it's going to inspire customers, we'll put the money behind it. So I think the Gap will continue to be, I'd say, the focus in the back half, Gap brand, mostly in North America. As Barbara asked earlier, China will continue to be a focus because it takes a long time to build your brand in China. And maybe it's a little smaller but still important to us is Athleta as we're starting to build that brand and put the stores out. After all, a physical store is a manifestation of the marketing investment to create the brand. So back half, we're committed to it. And look, first call in February, we said we'd take it quarter by quarter. But now that we've seen -- and we look at a lot of research besides traffic. We're feeling comfortable about the back half, about some investments in marketing. And the labor piece. That one, I tried to say in the opening call, it's really just some tests we're doing right now in our labor modeling. We made some tough decisions on labor during the heights of the recession in 2008, 2009, and we know that ultimately, our store environment, our store experience is critical. So whether that's the capital investments we're making, the right ones, but also labor investments, I would say that's more predominant inside of Banana Republic and Gap, and more predominant inside big markets. And so you look at the top 10 DMAs, you look at those 2 big brands, and that's where the labor tests and trying to step up our service model is taking place."

So as I said in the previous call, we're just very excited for him to join us in October. In advance of him joining us, and I'll get back to him in a second, I'm quite pleased with what Nancy Green and Tom Sands have done. You've got to give them credit. A lot of times at retail, when a leader leaves, businesses tend to sort of stay status quo, in some cases even flounder, because leadership changes can be impactful on a brand. And so kudos to them. We might’ve stepped in to help out as much as I can, but they've really led that business and that team. I'd say the thing that they've been doing is, I think that they've been really cleaning up and keeping the business simple, because I'm a big fan of taking on new initiatives in the business, and at times, you may take on a little bit too much and Old Navy is cleaning that up. They've gotten very, very focused on 3 initiatives. That's all they talk about. I'm not going to share those on the phone, but just 3 key focuses that whole business had, and that's what they brought. Another thing I will add, I believe our agency and our marketing team, which right now Michelle DeMartini is overseeing for us, she's one of our most senior merchants -- our marketing at Old Navy, which I love the positioning of the brand, we've talked about, that has not changed since I've been here, but the new platform and how to communicate the voice of the brand has really been good. I've been pleased since June, you've seen their business. And I think that's helping their business quite a bit. I mean, obviously, it starts with product like every other brand. But more than any other brand, I think their marketing has really resonated with their customers, and I've been very happy with that. What's Stefan going to do, it's -- I said I -- in fairness to him, he's had many, many months to think about it, but until he gets here and meets the team and works with them and figures out what he believes strategically, he's going to do matches up with what's -- what the team was able to get done. It's a little too soon to tell. I do know, and I'm -- so just an appropriate forum to share it with you, I do know what his vision is, having talked to him back in May. Obviously, he's away from us till October, but the last time I talked to him, whatever it was, 6 months ago, 4 months ago, I know that he definitely has a vision of what he wants to. So we'll see how that plays out and translates inside of our business. I -- but I want to make sure, one thing is important to me to make clear: his coming into the business was not driven by the most recent global ambitions we have for the brand. That's a given. I mean, he opened a number of the countries at H&M. Obviously, they're a global retailer like Gap is, a global brand that is. So that, I think, is icing on the cake. I believe he’s going to come in with a very strong perspective and position when it comes to product. That's what he knows, having worked in that business. So that's not taking Old Navy to H&M because he's understand the difference. But I believe he's going to really help us between the design conceptually to the merchandising, to the process, to the cost part, all the way to in-store execution. I think that part of Old Navy he is going to be super strong at, and the global piece will come over time. We only got one store in Japan. I think that'll just be a nice story to talk about in 2, 3, 4 years from now."

I did take note, as you mentioned, in the first quarter that, that was an unusually high amount of leverage, and it would be not prudent, in our view, to extrapolate that.

There are many variables that we've talked about that quarter-to-quarter could impact ROD, including the timing of our store openings, settlements with landlords, when amendments come through. So there's a lot of variables. But what I would say is the Q2 relationship to that level of comp is certainly a more appropriate level than we saw in Q1.

I'd say the first one, Randy, is something I -- to be repetitive, that's what I said to John, I think the traffic number was a number -- and I'm not here to rank necessarily all the metrics in order. Let's say you know the company, and a lot of people on the phone do. We're never really happy. And I think that our team has definitely embraced that sentiment. If there's a -- this is a quarter where we celebrate a few small wins. And we had some small wins, but the team executed well. We're particularly pleased, as I said in my opening comments, coming off last year where we were not at all happy with the business. Even though there was some circumstances outside of our control, we just weren't happy. Traffic is a number that we would prefer to not see negative. It's a number that we do look at holistically between our specialty business, our outlet business and our online business. If you look at it holistically, it's probably a different picture. But at the end of day, our store traffic, being negative in the quarter, is something that all of our teams, our store leaders, our brand presidents all know that in order to be happy as a business, we'd like to see all our metrics in positive territory, with the with the exception of AUC. Such is the way we have to start looking at the business. And -- but we also know that businesses' comp is an outcome. What -- how you get to comp is by taking certain strategies and really trying to take them deep. So this is just hypothetical, but maybe one brand is working more on AT, one brand is working more on units per transaction, one brand maybe working more on AUR. They have to pick the metric that supports their overall strategies. And as long as the key metrics they're trying to move in a positive direction to get to an outcome, like comp, is the framework of their performance, is meeting what they tell us they're going to do, then Sabrina and I are happy. But yes, we're always looking for -- knowing this business as well as I do now, coming from obviously different industries, what I do know as a metric that is going very well for you for a period of time, you'd be foolish to count on it for a number of years. So you always have to make sure there's other metrics that could get to the outcome of comp, that you're putting plans in place to strengthen them. Because one of the outcomes we're trying to get, to your second question, can we grow long term. It's obviously our goal. But when I think of growth, one thing I do want to put forward only because it's a number I asked Katrina for the other day, is in Q2 2011, we had 163 more stores than we do today. By that, I mean we closed 163 stores between Q2 '11 and Q2 '12. So when you think of growth, I always think comp is a metric that everybody should look at, but I'm all about top line sales. So that's a number we've said publicly that we're closer to the end of our real estate strategy, which involves closing down square footage that is unnecessary, consolidation from Kids and Baby [indiscernible] Gap into Adult, and also closing stores. We've done more. We have more to do, but we've done more in the last 3 years. So we're closer to the end than the beginning. That will certainly help top line growth. And that's a number that's important to me. Comp plus spread equals total sales. And while I'm not -- I have huge appreciation for comp, I’ve always been about top line sales. So I think growth, I think, will look more promising in the future when we get to the end of executing our real estate strategy. And lastly, Athleta, you’ve heard me pause on my opening comments. I mean, 11 stores in one quarter to a team that 18 months ago didn't have a store, it's pretty impressive when you think about it. I mean, some people, obviously, open 150, 200 stores in a quarter, but for that team to come where they've come, and I've been to a lot of real estate to hear the comments from customers in particular who wanted a physical manifestation of that brand, I'm very proud of that team in Petaluma led by Scott Key. They've done a great job. And this is early days. Well, I'd to tell you in the spring about what our plans for 2013, but we will open our 25 stores in 2012. We feel good about it right now. Great customer response. And I think that they think, and I'm more willing to support them than not, although it's early days, they feel they've got a bit of a tiger by the tail. And let's them feel that way. Nothing wrong with a little bit of confidence from our latest brand. We'll have more to talk about from Athleta in our meetings in the spring."

And like I said about the Athleta, we're very pleased and proud of our 2 leaders, Ann Doyle and Andi Owen, who run our 2 factory store outlet businesses. Is the traffic better there than in a specialty store? The answer is yes. So that's why I said earlier that if you take specialty plus outlet, plus online and then bring that together as one traffic number, our traffic is actually not that bad. But we have to look at it at channel by channel by channel. And our outlet channel is definitely, the traffic is better. So that's good. I think that's a little bit about the -- just the overall traffic that is in that genre of real estate. But the other thing is our team -- I'm glad you mentioned marketing. Our team is actually -- again, for a team that had no marketing when I started here and don't have a big marketing budget, but they're very, very scrappy and smart about how they spend their marketing, and they have great customer connections, whether that's through emails or through some of the partnerships they've done. So I think the marketing there, which is not a big driver of this increase in our SG&A, but they are getting a little bit more marketing than they have in the past, so they're making good use of it. And what we don't talk about, and that's -- I think everybody on this -- on the phone always wants to focus on our specialty business, particularly Gap, which I understand. But the product improvement at the -- in the outlet channel has been equal, at a minimum equal if not, some feel, they argue, better. But the step-up in the product and the investments, what they've done there, has been great. Very, very impressed. I'm in those stores a lot. I'll be out on Friday in some of them. So those merchant teams, those marketing teams under that leadership of a channel which we feel we have a competitive advantage in, we would -- we will continue to drive globally, is nothing short of impressive. So that's -- it's good to see. And we have high expectations for them going forward, but that's -- they're off also to a very good start so far this year."

So on the first one, what I do feel good about is that the stepped up performance in our top line sales, for the most part, has been driven by the categories we identified to make some reinvestments in. I think I was giving my theory on comp earlier. The same thing applies to product. Comp is an outcome. And if you're -- if you have a 4% comp, like we did in the second quarter across our multiple brands, that was a 7% in Gap, a 7% in Banana Republic, a 3% at Old Navy, let's just take Banana Republic for now. So you had a 7% comp. To get to that, the team has to plan certain categories they really believe and want to invest with all the reasons I gave earlier to try to get to 10% comp in that business, a 12% comp. Because if you try to get everything at a 7%, you're going to make some mistakes and the outcome will not be a 7%. So what I do like about the business so far is where they decided to stand behind what they believed in. This is not new. We've always had categories we want to have a competitive advantage in, we want to be dominant in our competitive set and want, therefore, define product assets. Those have not totally changed since I've been here. We've just been more focused on them. And this next leg was putting some money behind it, and I think that's really worked out. And I think the comp numbers are being driven in a large way by those categories we believe in. Early reads, all of our stores, we don't have a model like some other businesses. But the early reads where they help us, but we're doing it through social media by getting us some early reads on products that's not quite bought, which has been a helpful tool to us, or finding a way as product goes on our online site earlier and goes on our store, getting early reads so we could chase in, that's the most effective form of speed we can do. Early read, either through again, by crowd sourcing, let's call it for lack of a better word, and getting some feedback to help us better understand if that's the right product, whether it's a pattern, a print, a color, a style. But really, when you get in season, that's when I get excited. You get an early read online and read quickly through the fabric platforming we've done to be able to chase back in a very short period of time back in the goods that are going to be in our store more than 6 weeks. That's a process that we've been talking about in these calls for a number of years. We slowed speed down last year and chased down because with cotton being so unpredictable, we didn't want to have a -- change our business model too aggressively in 2011. In '12 now, we pushed our teams, and they've absolutely embraced the fact that there's a way to get some early reads that we have probably not used in our past, and get ao react more quickly. So faster pipeline, a speed pipeline and a way to get feedback from either a form of crowd sourcing or immediately through an online channel and then reacting to it much faster than we used to. That's in the early days, but it's helping us. The last part, the International formats we use, the only thing we have ever said, and then -- I don't think we ever changed any market we went corporate in, and we wouldn't change any market we've gone franchise in. It's the only thing we've ever said, is as we look forward, are there markets we consider joint venture. We don't want to take that off the table. That may be an option. Look at a markets like India. If we were to consider that at some point in the future, the only way to go with India right now is through a joint venture. So we're not against that if our franchisees wanted to turn it into a joint venture, if there's a franchise opportunity to go to corporate. We're not looking at those today. But I would say as our business continues to evolve and we look at our performance, we don't want to be completely married to the format we have. But there isn't a single decision we've made so far to go franchise in a country that we would ever change. I think every one of those was a good decision, and there isn't a single corporate country we went into -- we are in today we'd ever turn to franchise. So for the most part, what we've done so far is we're going to stick with. But let's look at the next 2, 3, 4 years and see if there's any change to the franchise relationships we have. I doubt it. But I'm just sort of saying that will be the only way we change any kind of relationship that we currently have in a market."

So I think here, they're trying to make sure that they tighten that up. I'll let Sabrina give you some color on the metrics."

As has been customary in the last number of calls, I'm going to provide some color on the performance in the second quarter and then I'm going to hand over to Sabrina, who will take you through a much more detailed review financially. 
Now the second quarter, there was a lot of bright spots inside the business that we feel good about. There's been a lot of effort, a lot of energy being directed to get us to where we are today. So I think the best thing for me to do is maybe take you through some of those bright spots and give you my sense of what we're doing and to give you a little more information behind the P&L.
So let's start with sales, which was very positive in the second quarter. We had a 4% comp, and that was made up by our 3 North American brands: a 7% comp in Gap North America, 7% Banana Republic and a 3% comp at Old Navy. And that's the second quarter in a row where the disbursement of our comp was very much driven almost equally across all 3 of the brands. That's very positive. When that happens, our business does very well, as you can see by the $0.49 earnings per share the company accomplished. 
Now there are a number of reasons why our business has been consistently positive for the first half of this year. The number one reason is product, and where there's been a lot of focus, a lot of effort starting late last year with our product teams. I'm really proud of the work they've done in the first half, whether that's on the right styles, which, obviously, we've had great success with so far, particularly in the second quarter. The color trend has been good for the industry, but we've capitalized on it. I think we've really focused on fit and consistency of fit, and our scores on that front are improving into the second quarter. And lastly, we've made these targeted investments in key categories, categories where we want to dominate, where we want to win. And those are our product assets. And we’ve put the money behind those assets. And our customers are noticing it. 
Second thing when it comes to sales is, I think we're flowing our product in a much more seasonally correct way. One thing that I've always been frustrated about is that July and January, in particular, have never been our best months. I think the teams are doing a much better job of reacting to that and putting seasonally, more correct product that customers want in our stores this past month.
And lastly, I'm going to take my hat off to our store teams. Our store execution in the second quarter was very good. There was a lot of stores in the second quarter. I saw not only the enthusiasm behind our store associates, but I think the standards, the execution, the visual merchandising, the windows were all a step above. That's been a big contributor to the company's performance on sales.
Gap Inc. Direct was up 24%. That obviously helps. When you look at our 4% comp in the second quarter, that was a good performance by that team. And the only thing that we're focusing on is our traffic was negative. And we know for the business to fire on all cylinders, we not only need to have AUR happening, store execution, the right product investments, but we need to have positive traffic. So you’ll see some further focus in that area in the second half of 2012.
Now we did end strongly, which I felt great about. I mean, that was a 10% comp in July. It's been a long time since we've had a double-digit comp like that. The calendar shift helped a little bit. We're a very holiday-driven business with so many outlet stores and Old Navy. Regardless of that, a 10% comp was a very nice way to end the quarter. 
Next I want to talk about is our International business. We had a minus 5% comp in Q2. And they expected, and we expected, a better business. So let me give you a little further color behind that minus 5% performance. It's obviously difficult in Europe right now. But what we feel good about our actual store distribution in the European market is we're very concentrated in key cities. London, Paris, Milan and Rome is a big percentage of our European business. As Europe begins a recovery at some point in the future, I think we're positioned properly by being much more dominant in those key cities.
In Japan, this was the first full quarter that anniversaried the disaster of 3/11. And us, like other Japanese retailers, were clearing through spring and summer product as traffic dropped significantly in the Japanese market. So we were up against that very aggressive clearance quarter. And I believe that, that will be behind us more in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And we have expectations that we'll have a better performance in Japan in the second half. And China's too small right now to be material to our comp number. 
Our total sales in the second quarter were up 6%. International business was up 7%. So even though the comp was negative, total sales were up 7% internationally.
Our Franchise business, up 25%, continues to go from strength to strength. Athleta opened 11 stores. I'm going to pause for a second. That's just a really good number for a young team to execute and deliver on. I was in a lot of those stores this summer. I think the store teams have executed well, and customers are responding very positively to have a physical presence of the brand in their neighborhood. Our global outlet business added 10 stores in the second quarter. That contributed to the 2% spread. And lastly, we opened up our first Old Navy store outside of North America, in Tokyo. I was there the week after it opened and was really impressed not only by how well we translated the brand into a whole new market, but the response of customers and families, in particular, which is the cornerstone of the Old Navy brand, was great to see when I was in Tokyo. So that will lay a nice groundwork. We're testing ideas, we're trying different things, but I think that sets us up nicely for the rollout of Old Navy in Japan in 2013.
From a margin perspective, we had a very nice lift in the second quarter. We are working aggressively on ticket integrity, selling product at full, regular price. I think that's been helpful to us. That doesn't just happen through a great product, although that's the initial first driver. It happens through words in the store or how our store associates sell it, what goes in the window. It also helps that the marketing investments we are making, we are creating demand on the first day. It either shows up online or shows up in the store. And this was the first quarter since late 2011 where our average unit cost, our cost of goods, were not significantly above the year before, and that contributed to the performance.
As a business, we are still very committed to making the right thoughtful investments in our SG&A line. One is marketing. Gap North America has been receiving some incremental marketing in the first half of this year, driving the Be Bright campaign. That has had really good feedback. Whether it's online we've heard through social media or in our stores, the campaign is resonating. Our digital investment, like other retailers, we're putting money behind digital. Whether that's online marketing or other tools, we understand where customers are shopping, we understand where they're getting their information. We've done some very good work on that front. And lastly, some money’s gone into store labor. We've got some service models we're looking at selectively in key stores. We're testing some ideas as I think there's an investment there in the second quarter that helped. 
And in closing, when you perform and deliver $0.49 in earnings per share over last year's $0.35, a 40% increase in EPS, of course, I think overall, people here are energized. It's a good feeling inside the business. What I have to do is make sure everybody stays focused. And that's what's critical, is what got us here to this performance. I just keep doing that. I keep repeating it. 
We mentioned on these calls before, the last fall was an important moment in the company: make sure that Gap Inc. comes out strong at the beginning of 2012. And that's what we've done. But we know that sustained performance is what matters, and everybody here is working hard every single day to make sure we maintain the momentum in the back half that we enjoyed in the first half of 2012. 
So with that said, let me hand over Sabrina, who will take you through the financial results of Q2 2012. Sabrina?"

We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per sh",1020,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. 
We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights. Consistent with the first quarter, net sales were up 6%, comparable sales were up 4% and our North American divisions, again each posted positive comps. Operating margin was up 200 basis points. Earnings per share grew 40%. And in addition, we generated strong free cash flow and returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the second quarter, operating income was up $91 million or 27%. Net earnings were up $54 million and earnings per share were $0.49, up from $0.35 last year.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Second quarter total sales were $3.6 billion, up 6% with comp sales up 4%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 14% to $1.4 billion. Second quarter gross margin was up 300 basis points to 39.9%. Our merchandise margins were up 210 basis points driven by the combination of growth in average unit retail and decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 90 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As foreshadowed in our July sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 6% on last year's up 5%.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We’ve noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's likely we'll deleverage operating expense. In line with that framework, second quarter total operating expenses were approximately $1 billion, up $85 million from the prior year. The increases were focused on our Gap Inc. Direct division, which grew sales 24% in the quarter, as well as marketing and store payroll investments across our other channels. Marketing expenses grew $33 million to $147 million, with the biggest increase driven by Gap brand's investment in windows, outdoor and digital media.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Second quarter capital expenditures were $149 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we opened 9 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,035 stores. Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q2 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $673 million, and we ended the second quarter with about $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the second quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares for $349 million at an average price of $26.65. We ended the quarter with 479 million shares outstanding. 
And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress during the first half of the year, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week, to $1.95 to $2. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 10% to about 11%. As a reminder, it's our objective to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins. 
A few things to keep in mind regarding our margins. While our average unit costs are improving in the back half versus 2011, they are not back to 2010 levels. It's also important to remember that in each quarter of 2011 and through Q1 of 2012, our average unit retails grew as we decreased units in the face of escalating product costs. Therefore, our plan to introduce more unit inventory in the second half of 2012 primarily at Old Navy may cause our average unit retail growth to slow compared to the first half of the year.
Regarding inventory. Although we plan to add units during the second half because the cost of each unit is lower, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q3 are expected to be down in the low single digits to last year.
Regarding operating expenses. Given the progress we've made on our product, as evidenced by customer response year-to-date, we believe it's prudent to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Specifically, we expect the increase over last year in operating expense in each of the remaining quarters to be at least as large as it was in the second quarter. As a result, we continue to expect to deleverage operating expense in the second half.
Moving on to cash. Our principles remain intact. Our stated priorities for the uses of cash are, first, to reinvest in our business to the degree we have projects that will deliver appropriate returns; and second, to distribute excess cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the improvement in our operating performance, we are increasing our full year capital guidance and are comfortable spending up to $675 million versus our previous guidance of about $600 million. Consistent with our strategy, the increase will be focused on remodels that accompany store consolidations and downsizes, as well as other store-related projects. We also plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we've consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012.
Finally, we plan to repay our $360 million term loan. This repayment, which has no prepayment penalty, will eliminate negative spread and further support our investment grade rating.
The following full year guidance metrics remains unchanged: net square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores, net of repositions, about 120 openings and about 115 closures; depreciation and amortization, about $475 million; effective tax rate, about 39.5%. 
In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategies during the first half of the year and our focus on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

That's our commitment. The news within that 30-store profile is that we're going to open up in 5 new cities. So we'll be in 10 cities at the end of the year, which sort of part of our real estate strategy was to go into Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong. And then last year, we opened up in 2 other cities, which were Tianjin and Hangzhou, and we're going be in 5 more cities by the end of this year. Such newsworthy because it allows us to answer your question actually, Barbara, which is, I'm not saying anybody, but brands, if you have a brand positioning globally, you can go into Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong and likely carve yourself up a decent-sized business. But to find out how big can China become given the fact that it's the second biggest market for apparel in the world, just passed Japan about 12 months ago, we decided to go in and make sure how well can we perform. But again, to your point on productivity, on return on capital, on sort of overall sales, how can we do in markets that we're going to need to get into and penetrate and be successful in order to have a meaningful business. So that's important for us to learn that. Second thing we did, we went online day 1, which we'll have our second anniversary this November. That was also important to find out: how would the Chinese consumers buy online, because it's different than it is here in the U.S., and that's not uncommon. In a lot of countries, the online penetration, the reception of it, yes, can be different. We've been very pleased with our online business. That's good to our overall strategy. And the third leg, to answer your question, in the future is we're opening 3 outlet stores this year. And I was actually just in China, and I was really impressed. I did outlet centers before, but I saw our 2 stores, 2 of the 3 that are under construction, and the quality of the sites, the quality of the cotenancy, which is really good for us. You're talking about Coach and Nike and people who we actually have nice cotenancy relations with here in the U.S. So I think I was impressed with that. So the answer, we'll know probably a little bit more at our analyst meeting next year. We'll be able at a -- figure out more about our strategic plan for China, where that's going to go. And -- but I'm -- I've always been a believer that, that was a great market for us because of our multiple brands, which we've not decided yet beyond Gap if we're going to do anything. The only decision we made so far is one brand with multiple channels. But I've always felt good about the market because of the American component of our brands and how well that resonates with Chinese consumers. And the last part will be that we do very well, and our marketing has skewed towards the millennials here in North America, and a version of that in China is the golden generation. And I think our marketing, our positioning, what we stand for, what this company believes in those brands -- our brands have -- our brand so far has done very well. So more to come, but we're off to a very good start."

We are nowhere near where we want to be, but we'd start feeling more comf [ph] than last fall as we look towards the spring and what our teams were able to get done and some of the changes, obviously, we made to get the confidence we started to feel internally last fall. So it starting with the product piece, that's the larger amount of the reinvest we're making in product. You saw some in the spring, and we were able, in the spring, to get an early read and we have ways these days to get a little earlier read than we used to. So I would say that, that encouraged us to continue on the same path. Maybe a bit of a step-up in investment in the third quarter in product, and the fourth quarter will be about the same as the third quarter. So the majority of this is, if you talk to our teams, and you've heard me say this before, but it's always worth repeating, to me the success ultimately of us selling products at full price and driving the kind of AUR performance that we believe we need to have inside of this business given our brands starts with having the right styles, and that's -- belongs to our design team, and having the right color. That's in spite of the move towards a color trend this year. We were not happy with the colors we put forward last year. So style, color, fit is critical, which, again, our design team and our production team owns. And there were some decisions made on categories that we want to be more dominant in. And I've listed some in the past. In Gap, it's get -- be -- being dominant in babyGap, being dominant in denim. That's important. For, obviously, Banana Republic, it's in suiting, and that's in woven shirts. But taking some of those categories that we can go out and we can give them the space they need because if you're going to put an investment in quality, that should come then with an investment in inventory, which should come with an investment in space in the store, which should come with an investment of the service model inside the store and, lastly, investment in marketing. So what we've been working on since last fall is the continuum of that, taking a product asset in each one of our brands and not just putting quality for the sake of putting quality because, in some cases, that could be money unnecessarily being spent. But being disciplined in how we do it, and then take it all the way that continuum I just took you through. So I'd say the difference you'll see in fall and holiday versus spring and summer is some decisions we’ve made on categories that we're able to chase into or some speed categories where we still think there's an opportunity to ultimately get. The goal here is to drive our value proposition, which is not overpaying for quality. So putting the quality where it makes sense, making sure of the right ticket price and driving right-price sales. Marketing, early days. I made -- I mentioned in my opening comments that if there's a metric that Sabrina and I are staring at and going, ""We'd like to see a little bit more of that"" is traffic. And there's no need to unnecessarily beat ourselves up over 40% increase in EPS, but we are always looking for the next opportunity. So the marketing piece, and I'm sure people have heard this maybe from other retailers, but as you shift your business model ever so slightly, we're still going to offer value, we're still going to have promotions. That's important particularly at Old Navy and in our outlet business. But as we shift to marketing, what is the acceptable lag effect until that pool of traffic gets replenished so maybe it's a better quality pool of traffic. So Sabrina and I are working with the brand presence. We'll make sure those investments. First of all, it's good quality marketing. In the past, when we have not spent money in marketing, because we weren't happy with it. And our marketing leaders know that if we're happy with the marketing and it makes sense and it's going to drive traffic and it's going to inspire customers, we'll put the money behind it. So I think the Gap will continue to be, I'd say, the focus in the back half, Gap brand, mostly in North America. As Barbara asked earlier, China will continue to be a focus because it takes a long time to build your brand in China. And maybe it's a little smaller but still important to us is Athleta as we're starting to build that brand and put the stores out. After all, a physical store is a manifestation of the marketing investment to create the brand. So back half, we're committed to it. And look, first call in February, we said we'd take it quarter by quarter. But now that we've seen -- and we look at a lot of research besides traffic. We're feeling comfortable about the back half, about some investments in marketing. And the labor piece. That one, I tried to say in the opening call, it's really just some tests we're doing right now in our labor modeling. We made some tough decisions on labor during the heights of the recession in 2008, 2009, and we know that ultimately, our store environment, our store experience is critical. So whether that's the capital investments we're making, the right ones, but also labor investments, I would say that's more predominant inside of Banana Republic and Gap, and more predominant inside big markets. And so you look at the top 10 DMAs, you look at those 2 big brands, and that's where the labor tests and trying to step up our service model is taking place."

So as I said in the previous call, we're just very excited for him to join us in October. In advance of him joining us, and I'll get back to him in a second, I'm quite pleased with what Nancy Green and Tom Sands have done. You've got to give them credit. A lot of times at retail, when a leader leaves, businesses tend to sort of stay status quo, in some cases even flounder, because leadership changes can be impactful on a brand. And so kudos to them. We might step in to help out as much as I can, but they've really led that business and that team. I'd say the thing that they've been doing is, I think, that they've been really cleaning up and keeping the business simple, because I'm a big fan of taking on new initiatives in the business, and at times, you may take on a little bit too much and Old Navy is cleaning that up. They've gotten very, very focused on 3 initiatives. That's all they talk about. I'm not going to share those on the phone, but just 3 key focuses that whole business had, and that's what they brought. Another thing I will add, I believe our agency and our marketing team, which right now Michelle DeMartini is overseeing for us, she's one of our most senior merchants -- our marketing at Old Navy, which I love the positioning of the brand, we've talked about, but has not changed since I've been here, but the new platform and how to communicate the voice of the brand has really been good. I've been pleased since June. And you've seen their business, and I think that's helping their business quite a bit. I mean, obviously, it starts with product like every other brand. But more than any other brand, I think their marketing has really resonated with their customers, and I've been very happy with that. What's Stefan going to do, it's -- I said I -- in fairness to him, he's had many, many months to think about it, but until he gets here and meets the team and works with them and figures out what he believes strategically, he's going to do matches up with what's -- what the team was able to get done. It's a little too soon to tell. I do know, and I'm -- so just an appropriate forum to share it with you, I do know what his vision is, having talked to him back in may. Obviously, he's away from us till October, but the last time I talked to him, whatever it was, 6 months ago, 4 months ago, I know that he definitely has a vision of what he wants to. So we'll see how that plays out and translates inside of our business. I -- but I want to make sure, one thing that's important to me to make clear. His coming into the business was not driven by the most recent global ambitions we have for the brand. That's a given. I mean, he opened in a number of the countries at H&M. Obviously, they're a global retailer like Gap is, a global brand that is. So that, I think, is icing on the cake. I believe he is going to come in with a very strong perspective and position when it comes to product. That's what he knows, having worked in that business. So that's not taking Old Navy to H&M because he's understand the difference. But I believe he's going to really help us between the design conceptually to the merchandising, to the process, to the cost part, all the way to in-store execution. I think that part of Old Navy he is going to be super strong at, and the global piece will come over time. We only got one store in Japan. I think that'll just be a nice story to talk about in 2, 3, 4 years from now."

I did take note, as you mentioned, in the first quarter that, that was an unusually high amount of leverage, and it would be not prudent, in our view, to extrapolate that. Sure enough, the ROD leverage was the same kind of level of comp at plus 4. It was 90 basis points in Q2. There are many variables that we've talked about that quarter-to-quarter could impact ROD, including the timing of our store openings, settlements with landlords, when amendments come through. So there's a lot of variables. But what I would say is the Q2 relationship to that level of comp is certainly a more appropriate level than we saw in Q1.

I'd say the first one, Randy, is something I -- to be repetitive, that's what I said to John, I think the traffic number was a number -- and I'm not here to rank necessarily all the metrics in order. Let's say you know the company, and a lot of people on the phone do. We're never really happy. And I think that our team has definitely embraced that sentiment. If there's a -- this is a quarter where we celebrate a few small wins. And we had some small wins, but the team executed well. We're particularly pleased, as I said in my opening comments, coming off last year where we were not at all happy with the business. Even though there was some circumstances outside of our control, we just weren't happy. Traffic is a number that we would prefer to not see negative. It's a number that we do look at holistically between our specialty business, our outlet business and our online business. If you look at it holistically, it's probably a different picture. But at the end of the day, our store traffic, being negative in the quarter, is something that all of our teams, our store leaders, our brand presidents all know that in order to be happy as a business, we'd like to see all our metrics in positive territory with the with the exception of AUC. Such is the way we have to start looking at the business. And -- but we also know that businesses' comp is an outcome. What -- how you get to comp is by taking certain strategies and really trying to take them deep. So this is just hypothetical, but maybe one brand is working more on AT, one brand is working more on units per transaction, one brand maybe working more on AUR. They have to pick the metric that supports their overall strategies. And as long as the key metrics they're trying to move in a positive direction to get to an outcome, like comp, is the framework of their performance, is meeting what they tell us they're going to do, then Sabrina and I are happy. But yes, we're always looking for -- knowing this business as well as I do now, coming from obviously different industries, what I do know as a metric that is going very well for you for a period of time, you'd be foolish to count on it for a number of years. So you always have to make sure there's other metrics that could get to the outcome of comp, that you're putting plans in place to strengthen them. As one of the outcomes, we're trying to get to your second question, can we grow long term. It's obviously our goal. But when I think of growth, one thing I do want to put forward only because it's a number I asked Katrina for the other day, is in Q2 2011, we had 163 more stores than we do today. By that, I mean we closed 163 stores between Q2 '11 and Q2 '12. When you think of growth, I always think comp is a metric that everybody should look at, but I'm all about top line sales. So that's a number we've said publicly that we're closer to the end of our real estate strategy, which involves closing down square footage at a time necessary, consolidation from Kids and baby [indiscernible] Gap into Adult, and also closing stores. We've done more. We have more to do, but we've done more in the last 3 years. We're closer to the end than the beginning. That will certainly help top line growth. And that's a number that's important to me. Comp plus spread equals total sales. While I'm not -- I have huge appreciation for comp, I have always been about top line sales. So I think growth, I think, will look more promising in the future when we get to the end of executing our real estate strategy. And lastly, Athleta, you heard me pause on my opening comments. I mean, 11 stores in one quarter to a team that 18 months ago didn't have a store, it's pretty impressive when you think about it. I mean, some people, obviously, open 150, 200 stores in a quarter, but for that team to come where they've come, and I've been to a lot of real estate to hear the comments from customers in particular who wanted a physical manifestation of that brand, I'm very proud of that team in Petaluma led by Scott Key. They've done a great job. And this is early days. Well, I'd to tell you in the spring about what our plans for 2013, but we will open our 25 stores in 2012. We feel good about it right now. Great customer response. And I think that they think, and I'm more willing to support them than not, although it's early days, they feel they've got a bit of a tiger by the tail. And let's them feel that way. Nothing wrong with a little bit of confidence from our latest brand. We'll have more to talk about from Athleta in our meetings in the spring."

So that's why I said earlier that if you take specialty plus outlet, plus online and bring that together as one traffic number, our traffic is actually not that bad. But we have to look at it at channel by channel by channel. And our outlet channel is definitely, the traffic is better. So that's good. I think that's a little bit about the -- just the overall traffic that is in that genre of real estate. But the other thing is our team -- I'm glad you mentioned marketing. Our team is actually -- again, for a team that had no marketing when I started here and don't have a big marketing budget, but they're very, very scrappy and smart about how they spend their marketing, and they have great customer connections, whether that's through emails or through some of the partnerships they've done. So I think the marketing there, which is not a big driver of this increase in our SG&A, but they are getting a little bit more marketing than they have in the past, so they're making good use of it. And what we don't talk about, and that's -- I think everybody on this -- on the phone always wants to focus on our specialty business, particularly Gap, which I understand. But the product improvement at the -- in the outlet channel has been equal, at a minimum equal if not, some feel, they argue, better. But the step-up in the product and the investments, what they've done there, has been great. Very, very impressed. I've been in those stores a lot. I'll be out on Friday in some of them. So those merchant teams, those marketing teams under that leadership of a channel which we feel we have a competitive advantage in, we would -- we will continue to drive globally, is nothing short of impressive.

So on the first one, what I do feel good about is that the stepped up performance in our top line sales, for the most part, has been driven by the categories we identified to make some reinvestments in. I think I was giving my theory on comp earlier. The same thing applies to product. Comp is an outcome. If you're -- if you have a 4% comp, like we did in the second quarter across our multiple brands, that was a 7% in Gap, a 7% in Banana Republic, a 3% at Old Navy, let's just take Banana Republic for now. So you had a 7% comp. To get to that, the team has to plan certain categories they really believe and want to invest with all the reasons I gave earlier to try to get to 10% comp in that business, a 12% comp. Because if you try to get everything at a 7%, you're going to make some mistakes and the outcome will not be a 7%. So what I do like about the business so far is where they decided to stand behind what they believed in. This is not new. We've always had categories we want to have a competitive advantage in, we want to be dominant in our competitive set and want, therefore, to find product assets. Those have not totally changed since I've been here. We've just been more focused on them. And this next slide was putting some money behind it, and I think that's really worked out. And I think the comp numbers are being driven in a large way by those categories we believe in. Early reads, all of our stores, we don't have a model like some other businesses. But the early reads where they help us but we're doing it through social media by getting us some early reads on products that's not quite bought, which has been a helpful tool to us, or finding a way as product goes on our online site earlier and goes on our store, get early reads we could chase in, that's the most effective form of speed we can do. Early read, I [indiscernible] go through again, by crowd sourcing, let's call it for lack of a better word, and getting some feedback to help us better understand if that's the right product, whether it's a pattern, a print, a color, a style. But really, when you get in season, that's when I get excited. You get an early read online and read quickly through the fabric platforming we've done to be able to chase back in a very short period of time back in the goods that are going to be in our store more than 6 weeks. That's a process that we've been talking about in these calls for a number of years. We slowed speed down last year and chased down because with cotton being so unpredictable, we didn't want to have a -- change our business model too aggressively in 2011. In '12 now, we pushed our teams, and they've absolutely embraced the fact that there's a way to get some early reads, albeit probably not used in our past, and get to react more quickly. So faster pipeline, a speed pipeline and a way to get feedback from either a form of crowd sourcing or immediately through an online channel and then reacting to it much faster than we used to. That's in the early days, but it's helping us. The last part, the International formats we use, the only thing we have ever said, and then -- I don't think we ever changed any market we went corporate in, and we wouldn't change any market we've gone franchise in. It's the only thing we've ever said, is as we look forward, are there markets we consider joint venture. We don't want to take that off the table. That may be an option. Look at a markets like India. If we were to consider that at some point in the future, the only way to go with India right now is through a joint venture. So we're not against that if our franchisees wanted to turn it into a joint venture, if there's a franchise opportunity to go to corporate. We're not looking at those today. But I would say as our business continues to evolve and we look at our performance, we don't want to be completely married to the format we have. But there isn't a single decision we've made so far to go franchise in a country that we would ever change. I think every one of those was a good decision, and there isn't a single corporate country we went into -- we are in today we'd ever turn to franchise. So for the most part, what we've done so far is we're going to stick with. But let's look at the next 2, 3, 4 years and see if there's any change to the franchise relationships we have. I doubt it. But I'm just sort of saying that will be the only way we change any kind of relationship that we currently have in a market."

Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, I do want to talk about the quarter and the performance of Gap Inc. in Q3. I want to talk about the announcement from a month ago that the move of Gap Inc. to global brands. So let me start with that.
A month ago, we announced that our business made a structural change that will be effective in February 2013. In 2008, Gap Inc. was an American-centric channel led business, that was completely the appropriate structure for that time. But we've been in a journey. We've been moving the company at a pace that we're comfortable with, you could never go from an American-centric organization to global brands without having stores in China, without having online that was launched globally, without having outlet stores internationally. As those proof points came together, it made sense this was the right time to move to a global brand structure.
This was driven by the customer. Customers clearly are becoming more and more global. As we go around the world and all of us travel there's more in common than I've ever seen between a customer in New York, in London, in Tokyo and Toronto and Istanbul. So from our perspective, looking at our business globally is very important to have one lens, one management team looking at the brand across all different channels in all different International countries. What we're expecting to get out of this state change his speed, for sure, with one team deciding across every touch point we have to the customer. We're going to get more efficiency, which is critical. This change definitely puts the brand ahead of channels. Channels are important. And the corporate strategy has been clearly identified as multiple channels. But this is putting the brand first. And secondarily, it's about global over local. Local is important. We need to understand the local needs of our customers in Gap brand in particular that operates over 40 countries. But this is the global approach to the business first. And this structure from my perspective is definitely going to put in place to fuel long-term growth. We've had a good year so far on growth. We want to have strong growth every single year looking forward, and this structure is going to be an enabler to that kind of performance.
Now let me talk about the quarter and I'll look at a couple of ways, one domestically, internationally, and also give you a little bit of commentary in our growth initiatives. Domestically, the business had an A-comp, that was a very good performance for our domestic brands. Now what is encouraging as I talked to you about in the second quarter, this was product-led. Our product teams delivered the product to our online business, to our stores that allowed us to get to this kind of comp, and its key categories. Everyone of our brand has been strategically saying what's the category and comp as an outcome. You have to have a plan across the categories where you want to differentiate yourself, how can you get a competitive advantage? Where do you want to put you inventory, your marketing? Drive those categories to get to a comp and that's what we saw in this quarter. The other thing I want to talk to you about is we've been working on more of a WEAR NOW approach. There's been a couple of transition seasons between summer and fall, and winter and spring. I think as a business, we've lost market share. So this quarter more than anyone I've seen in our past was much better executed in that transition of product. And that's where our comps were strong in August and September.
And lastly, we had very good reg price selling. Selling more products online and in our stores at regular price is a metrical watching closely and does talk about long-term health of the brand. On the International business, we had a minus 3% comp. Now our total sales have been on par with our domestic business, and that speaks to Old Navy Japan, our China business, our franchise business but our comp of minus 3% is something the team is focused on. We would like to see the International business improve that trajectory through the corrective measures they're taking. Let me give an update on the company's growth plans.
Our franchise team has opened in 8 countries already, with 1 more to go. So a very big year for that team in terms of number of new countries. We opened up in Japan online. So now Gap Inc. has an online presence that we control. In Europe, in Canada, in the U.S., in China and now finally, in Japan. And if our strategy, which we are so committed to a multiple channels and to multiple geographies continues to produce the results we hope, this was a critical step in that direction. In China, we're very comfortable with the performance of our business. We're on track to open a number of stores we committed ourselves to. The milestone in the third quarter was we opened 4 outlet stores in China. So in November 2010, we opened up 4 specialty stores with our online business day 1, and here we are, less than 2 years later, opening up our outlet centers in China, which we believe will be a nice opportunity in that country.
And lastly, Athleta continues to perform very well. And most encouraging in this quarter is now we've opened up stores in all different kinds of real estate. We have street stores, we have mall stores, we have lifestyle stores, we have strip centers. And what's been impressive is how well Athleta performs in everyone of them. That opens up lots of opportunities for that brand if we can perform at this level going forward in all different types of real estate, that makes the brand very flexible.
Let me close by mentioning we know it's been a very difficult time for people on the East Coast, dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Gap Inc. has 28,000 employees that were in the path of the hurricane, and what was primary to us was the safety of our employees, nothing is more important to us than that, and we're so happy that by all accounts, our employees are safe and sound. They've been impacted like so many other people. That's why I want to encourage you on the phone, if you haven't given, please give money to any cause, give to the Red Cross, give to the Salvation Army. People are in need even 3 weeks after this horrible event. We're in the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for this for many, many weeks. We know how important this quarter is. We're 2 weeks in but this quarter now is all about execution. How are we going to execute in the stores? How we're going to execute online? How we're going to execute on our outlook channels versus specialty channels? This is what it comes down to. I think the team has shown to continue to be even better at execution, committed to it. And this is a quarter where you want to go out and you want to get the right product, the right marketing, you want to gain share, and you want to win. And that's our goal. So with that said, let me turn it over to Sabrina to take you through the financial performance for the third quarter."
274265,223844333,388359,"Gap Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently",821,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 8% and comparable sales were up 6%, with all North American divisions continuing to post positive comps. Operating margin expanded by 380 basis points to 13.5%, and earnings per share grew 66% to $0.63.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap.
In the third quarter, operating income was $520 million, up $174 million and net income was $308 million, up $115 million.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. As customers continue to respond favorably to our product, third quarter total sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% with comp sales up 6%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 21% to $1.6 billion. Third quarter gross margin was up 450 basis points to 41.2%. Our merchandise margins were up 330 basis points, driven primarily by decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 120 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. With the benefit of average unit cost coming down during Q3, we were able to sell more units while are managing our total inventory dollars tightly. As a result, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 4% at the end of the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We've noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses during 2012, and highlighted that it's likely we will deleverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, third quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up $105 million from the prior year, with an ongoing focus on the areas of marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses deleveraged by 80 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $29 million to $178 million, driven primarily by ongoing investments in Gap brand marketing and CRM.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $449 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we've opened 32 stores on a net basis year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,068 stores. Square footage was down 2% compared to Q3 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share count on Slide 10. Year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of $776 million, and we ended the third quarter with about $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Year-to-date, we spent $463 million on share repurchases, including $96 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares in the third quarter.
We ended the quarter with 480 million shares outstanding.
And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress year-to-date, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes a 53rd week to $2.20 to $2.25. In addition we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 11% to about 12%. As a reminder, it's our objective to continue to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins.
As we lapped last year's average unit cost increases, we expect fourth quarter merchandise margins to expand.
In terms of inventory, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q4 are expected to be up in the low single digits versus last year.
Regarding operating expenses, we plan to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Therefore, we expect the increase over last year in operating expenses in Q4 to be at least as large as the 11% increase in Q3. And as a result, we also expect to deleverage operating expenses in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to cash. We plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we've consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012. As a reminder, our third quarter weighted average diluted shares were 488 million.
Regarding our effective tax rate, we now expect our full-year rate to be about 39%, down from our previous guidance of about 39.5%, driven primarily by tax credits.
The following full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged: Square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores about 15 net openings; capital expenditures about $675 million; depreciation and amortization about $475 million.
In closing, we're very pleased with how we executed against our strategies in the first 3 quarters. As we enter our most important selling season of the year, we remain committed to executing on our financial goals while continuing to make improvements and investments in our business. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

I think you have a combination of 2 things going on. We talked about this back in the call in February, or sort of refocused design merchandising inventory teams about what are the key businesses that we currently see us gaining market share on that are right for the brand to find the customer can be marketed properly and as I said in my commentary, really provide other competitive advantage because of a product asset and a point of differentiation against our competition. So I think the teams have been very much focused on that. I think there may have been a moment in time where I think we were probably just spreading our focus a little too broadly. Now I was always been a believer that if you had a set of categories that hit that all the criteria mentioned earlier, Betty, and then you can bring in new businesses and new categories because the only the that we're going to be at a comp consistently is the focus as I said on -- about those key categories and product assets that each brand believes in while looking at new business opportunities that one day could become possibly, a product asset. So I think that it's that marriage of those 2 that allows the business to get the now, positive comps. Non-GAAP, no big surprise. You've got the denim business, which our LA office, working with the New York office and all those teams, I really think that they've delivered some spring, a denim offering that is not only driven and look to the overall business but I think it's been bringing in the right customer, which is difficult to Gap's market strategy. And on top of that, another up was on the product asset for the Gap brand is it's Baby business. So those 2 just as examples have really helped propel the kind of comps you've seen on a Gap brand domestically. And, are again no big surprise -- has been a strong business for us. Men's and Women's for the last 3 quarters and we've complemented that with woven tops, which was stronger in men's for a long, long time but it's nice to see this year a little bit of our investment in products has gone to Women's woven tops. And that's also been a very strong business for us. At Old Navy, it's been denim but really a focus on the rockstar jean, which is a little bit of a higher AIR. Hopefully, through that you materialize to a higher AUR but the fit, the colors, the marketing have all come together. That and the kid's business at Old Navy, especially in Q3, where the team I think did an exceptional job on back-to-school. So execution of the plan for the last 15 months has been good but I think its that combination that I spoke about earlier that's important to me being right strategically, right on the execution, looking at new business opportunities and therefore, the goal here is to have momentum on the comp performance at our global business. But in this quarter particularly, our domestic business was very strong."

This has been the best year we've had a long time, so I'm pleased with the up. Now that's combination -- obviously, it starts with the right decisions being made on product. I will say that to Betty earlier, that all holds true to our reg price selling. I think inventory management had a tough a tough year last year, it's difficult for them with huge increases that you see the pyrite that probably didn't help in our goal last year even to try to get a better reg sell price. There's been some really good decisions being made up, we a little bit of that is process changes, some investments, some investments in the systems, I think that certainly helped that team and you have the marketing investments we're making. And then lastly, I would say that our store team have been much more focused and I think we've been flowing the product to them that allows them to capture a better opportunity on reg price selling. So we're a little bit pushing new rivals. I'm not get a good number but the percentage of weeks now that Old Navy flows new products coming tested better know this perfect but my supposition it has to be the highest it's ever been. The number of weeks that Old Navy receives fresh, new products. So you put that all in combination and we've had a good year on that front. Now what I will say to you that we have a long way to go to get to the numbers I think that all 3 brands should be at. I think that's going to -- it's really going to happen through consistent performance on the product side and consistent execution and marketing. But the teams commitment and I think our customers response so far -- a big thing I've always believed in that we've done a decent job of, but not as well as I thought we could have, our actual initial pricing is very sharp across the different brands, different customer groups. If you look at the initial pricing at Old Navy, at Gap, at Banana Republic, it's very good. So our goal midterm and long term is to reduce our dependency on having to get off those prices because they are very good. And this is really a global strategy that you're seeing being applied much more focused now in Europe, in Japan and in China. So I think the teams are pleased with the performance of our but to answer your question, I think this is really early days for how high a bargain be for these 3 brands on reg price selling. Now it helps having that leading the business because we realized how high is high, because the reg price selling is very attractive. It's been helpful too -- company because I think he's also been giving us a feeling from his perspective of what healthy looks like when it comes to reg price selling. So I think those are just 2 other sort of data points that have reinvigorated the team to be committed to this metric over the next number of years."

That trend still holds true. Our -- both our value businesses being in Banana Republic Factory Stores, Gap Outlet and Old Navy, their traffic is still noticeably stronger than it is at Banana Republic and Gap specialty stores. So I think -- I'll just give you one sort of approach we're taking. Gap brand, we've been putting more marketing behind the brand since spring. And I think we've all been clear here that as we try to get more new customers, some laps customers into the business and ultimately move that traffic metric, it's going to take a little bit of time. There's a lag effect that's going to take a Gap brand. We're committed to the marketing, we're committed to our messaging, we're committed to the new mediums and the areas we're investing but we -- the team knows that there's an expectation that as we keep giving them more funds and marketing that at some point, we're going to -- at some point, we'd explain to them that there's a day where we want to see the traffic be much -- on a much better trajectory than it's been so far in specialty. It's not a disaster. It's just not quite what we believe it should be long term. And that's again to help the business. As I was answering some of the questions earlier, I think when you're talking about better product and you're talking about better inventory management a focus on key categories, that again being consistently done, is the ultimate driver of better traffic. But marketing is something that we've taken very seriously this year and we've been again, we've been pleased. There's always improvement in our value business. We've been pleased the third quarter was I think another -- another better performance by our 3 value businesses in terms of traffic. But we'd like to see Banana Republic specialty and Gap specialty start to change the trajectory they've been on, on traffic. And so we'll watch that in Q4 and we'll see how we do."

And with that reintroduction of units, we expected that the growth rate in AUR would not be as high as it was in the first half. So in fact, in Q3, overall, AURs were up just very slightly.

But suffice it to say, look, we -- one big one that we've talked about publicly but it's also part of some of the performance improvement we've seen this year, and something we believe in long-term will continue to add value to the business on the operating margin side, is this shift in our mix of our business towards where the customer is and it just happens to be where we think we have a competitive advantage against our global competitors. So the customer is certainly moving more and more online. That's not a -- that's not a new story. But we have invested properly in that business. We will talk more in February about what our version, which I'd like to think it's a little unique to the omni-channel approach is going to be across our 3 brands and how we set ourselves up. And that even though we're making the change for our global structure and making online and outlet and specialty and franchise all part of one leadership team, what I said in my opening comments, I think one of the benefits of making that change is the speed of decision-making and the move on that strategic front at a faster pace and we're going to be seen. So we're going to put one person in charge of all earnings across the brand, one amount of capital that, that Global Brand President is going to be. One global capital, it tends to go towards the biggest opportunity is. So I think the online business will grow -- continue to grow much stronger than our specialty business. But I think that even -- that delta can even grow over time as we get to this new structure and start putting the infrastructure in place to execute our version of omni-channel long term. Our value business, defined as Banana Republic Factory Stores and the Gap Outlet business, I think again globally, still has a long, long way to go and huge opportunity. So you may have heard us say this before, Kimberly, but I think our strategy against our global competitor is right. I think we have a competitive advantage. I think the customers are moving both aggressively and accepting more and more people going to either power centers, value centers as lifestyle centers get transitioned. Globally, and power centers, value centers and we have a channel that appeals to that customer to where that growth is, same with online, and we've obviously been pretty clear on this, the best return on sales and the best return on capital the company has is on those 2 channels. So I think that the new global brand presence, looking at the brand holistically, even we moved at a decent pace over the last 3 to 4 years, that's to execute on that strategy. I think that's going to give the company, execute it properly, will give us nice earnings growth going forward as we change the mix of the business."

It's really that we're comping a year that was unusual in '11. With that very high average unit cost, we pulled out a lot of units because from a total cost inventory perspective, we didn't want that ballooning too much. So this year, with that coming down, we're actually just trying to reintroduce unit to a level which are more comfortable for many historical velocity level that we would see at Old Navy. Now of course, our hope in all of that is to continue as our overall goal is for the company, is to continue to positive comp in a manner that has us gaining some market share. So that is our overall goal. But we want to do that with healthy margins.

And him and Michael Francis and myself, spend a little more time together probably early in the new year discussing Old Navy and it's creative platform that supports its brand positioning. And I think more than anything as I talked to Michael quite a bit over the last 45 days, I think Michael what we sees is an opportunity to change the mix of our marketing and maybe get a little more bang for our buck like some other brands out there. May be we're little too married to our television exposure. Television and Old Navy go handed globe. There's something about that brand, but it's customers and how it really resonates. Hopefully, we'll see that as the television kicks in next week for Black Friday, and the weekend after Black Friday. But the creative I think of work that Michael has done here it was really looking not only about the creative positioning of Old Navy and all the tools and mediums available for us but how do we get more for the money we have. So still to be determined. I can do to them are them are spending left onto political Michael is adding some great new value over there. If you need the new year, we'll sit down and figure that out. And obviously, lowest big believer justification and we're going to get something from it that in this case, could be whether it's traffic driving or whether we introduced a new categories or some other reason, I'm sure we're open to it. What I will also say is don't forget Old Navy in 2013 steps up a little bit more globally and we're going to start looking at some marketing in the Japan market to make sure that gets off to a strong start focus on incremental money there than do anything domestically. Because again, it's worth repeating, I'm pretty comfortable with the amount of money that we have right now."

A big area that's changed. The first step we took towards global brands was in the spring summer of 2011 with a number of changes we've made on the company structure. One that gets to the corrective measure comment you just made was to bring one International leader, Stephen Sunnucks, who's now going to be our global President for Gap brand, and he brought all of the natural merchant teams together, hired an amazing lead who's now going to run the global merchandising named Liz Meltzer. A history with J.Crew and Uniqlo. And what Liz did and you'll see start to see some network show up in the market just now in our franchise business and Europe and in Japan and in China was really bringing all of that -- all of those teams together under one strong view on assortment architecture and pricing architecture. Now we weren't so divergent that you wouldn't know it was Gap brand. I actually -- my comments at the beginning what I said was possibly up until this year, we're a little more local at the expense of global. And that's fine. I was -- I was trying with the other executives in the business, we were all sitting back and trying to find out what is that right balance? Clearly, with some of the work we've done, some of the research, some of the customer work we've done around the world, the decisions for the new structure was for global first and local second and keeping with that, the work that Liz under Steven's leadership have put forward is that you will see now a much more consistent approach in our assortment around the world, not identical because we are such believers in local opportunities. What I believe is going to happen now is they will now be able to go, instead of an inch deep and a mile long, they will be at a go an inch wide and a mile deep on what really differentiates Japan from China, from Europe, from some of our key franchise markets. That work is already beginning. Now we're not going to get a huge benefit in the fourth quarter but I am expecting that some of the changes they've made will be the beginning of some of the course correction action. That, coupled with our pricing, I was talking earlier that we've actually pretty good with our initial pricing. I actually feel in North America, we're highly competitive for the customers we're going after against the competitive sets of each one of our brands. I probably couldn't say that with as much confidence internationally until now. And I do think that again, under the leadership of Stephen and Liz, our International business is much more competitive in this fourth quarter, and therefore, going forward with its pricing architecture. So those 2 of many actions that were taken while Steven led the International business, hopefully will start to change the trajectory we've seen in that business for the last 5 or 6 quarters now."

As I said earlier,",274,"Yes, no, I think that clearly, nobody should be making the assumption that the restructuring we made and the repositioning of the brands to a global view is going to add cost to the business. That's not what the intention behind it was. As I said earlier, we're going to get speed. One of the big benefits we're going to get is that on a more common approach as we shift to, as I said earlier to the global local approach to our business, Gap brand in particular across over 40 countries. We've actually, since 2007, I'd say let's call to the service functions in the business between finance and HR and real estate and supply chain and IT, the business under Sabrina's leadership we've done a great job making a very efficient service model to the brands in place. And those services were already global. So the infrastructure on which the brand sits were already global, and we're leveraged and we've been doing a great job on that front. This is a trend related to the brand level only, it will sit on the exact same infrastructure we had before of shared services, where we've continued to actually get great benefit and efficiency from that. So this is really a change that I think is customer facing, that will get the benefits I talked about earlier. Now you have 3 significant leaders who run all of our big iconic brands, and I think that it's early days. Those teams don't officially start working together until the new fiscal year but we're confident that we're going to get the outcomes I talked about earlier."

Well, obviously, online business is young in both the 27 countries we serve in Europe. And as I said earlier, Japan just opened a month ago. But earlier in the case of Japan are very positive. The online business in Europe is very strong. And look, we've been making the same some sort of approach that we've had here in the U.S. making sure the stores are right, focusing on key cities in Europe, making sure we're investing and remodeling the stores that make sense, we're going to hold on to long term and as the customer starts to return and I would not say in Europe, we're seeing any signs of that just yet because there's some numbers that came out of the U.K. and once again, the customer apparel numbers were soft in the U.K. for October. So there's no -- there's no great sign right now in Europe, these are H&M's numbers that came out today. So we have a large business there. We have an important business. We're keeping a tight, reinvesting in our value sector and online and that's it for now until we see signs of real improvement inside of Europe. In Japan, where the consumer is slightly better, our Old Navy business, as you said, is one store only. We'll comment in February about how many stores we're going to open for Old Navy in 2013. But we feel very good about the first story. Online, I think it will be an amazing add-on to the BRICS business we have right now and there, again, it's Gap specialty. The team is on it. To answer John's question earlier think some of the work that Liz Meltzer has bought to the business, early indications will be in 2013, about how that change corrective measures are going to take place. A little bit in the fourth quarter but I think we've taken a lot of steps to get our International business perform at a higher level for Gap Specialty. But certainly, not been an area we've been pleased about. But I think the team we have confidence in and they're going to take some of those ideas now, they're going to go into the brands and I believe the brands will execute that strategy and find even more ways to make sure that our International business performs better in 2013 on a top line basis than we've experienced so far in 2012. But more to come on that front."

But again, in fairness, 2011 was a very difficult year for our inventory management team with this change in -- of this paradigm shift of average unit cost to inventory units that they've bought. Having said that, I really think of the process changes I'm seeing driven at Old Navy but some of this applies to Gap Specialty and Gap outlet, and Banana Republic specialty business but the inventory teams are I think they're doing a much better job in 2012, and I'm actually feeling that any system investments -- and look, everybody is always putting some kind of money to their inventory management system. I think that we're just making sure those teams have all the right tools. But as we look we'll talk about this in the new year, as we look in our business because right now, we've been talking about inventory can be viewed more seamless from a customer perspective between channels. So when we do a little bit of that work right now and our ship-from-store strategy, which allows us to take product that is in demand online but to one of our stores. So we've done a lot of work on that front. We'll talk more about that in the new year. But I think one of the next moves even though there's been some small investments that have been helpful 2012. A big shift for us is how do start treating our inventory that's seamless to a customer across channels of online and specialty, and across geographies most importantly. I think that's going to be critical looking forward for a business like ours. And there's a lot of value to be created by doing that. And Stephan, look, it's 30 days. I just think that we didn't hire him to come in and just oversee the status quo. We brought him into the business because we believe his experience, which is phenomenal, and his view of retailing, whose knowledge of specialty and retail and fashion in particular, the work he's done on processes and making sure that the company's like ours learn to move faster because that's really going to be important going forward. The customers will be fast, therefore we have to respond and move equally as fast. I think that early days, but I'm just impressed with some of the observations he's been making and shareholders and investors on the phone turn to 2013 will be an opportunity for everybody to meet him. And I'm sure he'll be happy to share some of his observations, what he thinks is great about Old Navy which obviously, that includes a lot about the brand that is positioning. But what are some of the opportunities that he thinks he's going to put into place and what's speed to create incremental value for shareholders."

We're thinking we'll end this year on our domestic real estate strategy. I think I'll come back to Europe in a second. But our domestic real estate strategy will end this year in the 7 rate innings of the plan we outlined to investors in 2008, so I think that -- hats off to our real estate team who has done a phenomenal job. So by the end of '13, I think when you look at square footage reductions at Old Navy, if you will pretty much out be there. We look at Gap closures. pure closures and then consolidations I think will pretty much be there. So in Banana Republic was never a big change but there's some changes that were necessary in Jack Calhoun's lead. Those are for the most part done. And I think that the move now domestically is to look at these missed opportunities for the Gap Outlet business and the factory store business. We just opened up a store in Fulton Street in New York City, where the specialty business would not get the kind of customer traffic it needs given its value proposition. We put in a Gap factory store there and it's doing phenomenally well. So I think that as we've tightened up the real estate for all the right reasons, there's a few opportunities still available for us domestically. And when Katrina was giving out maybe when Sabrina was giving out the net number of stores in the quarter, I always think about how this is a year where we're going to open close to 200 stores. But we have a lot of closures this year because this was a very big year for us for closures. We have one more year to go of repositioning the 2013 and meaningful number of closures, probably not as high as '12, but we'll give you that information in February in 2013. And then we'll be able to be in a place where we're not operating like we had the last 4 years with quite a few closures per unit drag down the company's total sales. So I think that the good performance with real estate team, I'll deal with 2 issues that you brought up against remodels. We're still very happy with the remodel work at Old Navy. I'm sure Stephan will have a point of view on that but we've been very happy with the work's that's been done. We've been very happy with the Gap global model. We just opened at 34 Street in New York, just reopened beautiful store doing very well. So very happy with how that store looks and how it's coming across. I think Jack Calhoun has continued to tweak the remodels prototype for Banana Republic. So I think that that's good but I think is tweaking it. So I think we go good about our models. Athleta obviously, is very strong. And lastly, if I was to say there was one area where productivity is the hugest -- sorry, is the most significant opportunity for us on productivity, that would be the Gap brand specialty. All our brands have an opportunity on productivity but Gap brand specialty, with a repositioned fleet now in terms of number of stores in square footage, I got to believe mark is look at that and going that's the biggest opportunity them is to get better productivity in this new fleet."

We obviously, are focused on great assortments. So part of the sustainability of moving forward with our positive comps, which is our objective, is going to be to keep making investments in those smart areas, where we think we can get the average unit retail for it. So we keep those healthy margins. But mostly, it's going to be a continuation of healthy product acceptance and modestly introducing more units sale once we've achieved that healthy merchandise margins. So we're growing our gross margin. So that's going to be the recipe going forward into '13, and we'll give more details as we enter that year."

Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, I do want to talk about the quarter and the performance of Gap Inc. in Q3. I want to talk about the announcement from a month ago of the move of Gap Inc. to global",1263,"Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, I do want to talk about the quarter and the performance of Gap Inc. in Q3. I want to talk about the announcement from a month ago of the move of Gap Inc. to global brands. So let me start with that.
A month ago, we announced that our business made a structural change that will be effective in February 2013. In 2008, Gap Inc. was an American-centric channel led business. That was completely the appropriate structure for that time. But we've been on a journey. We have been moving the company at a pace that we're comfortable with, you could never go from an American-centric organization to global brands without having stores in China, without having online that was launched globally, without having outlet stores internationally. As those proof points came together, it made sense, this was the right time to move to a global brand structure.
This was driven by the customer. Customers clearly are becoming more and more global. As we go around the world and all of us travel, there's more in common than I've ever seen between a customer in New York, in London, in Tokyo and Toronto and Istanbul. So from our perspective, looking at our business globally is very important, to have one lens, one management team looking at the brand across all different channels in all different international countries. What we're expecting to get out of this change is speed, for sure, with one team deciding across every touch point we have to the customer. We're going to get more efficiency, which is critical. This change definitely puts the brand ahead of channels. Channels are important. And the corporate strategy has been clearly identified as multiple channels. But this is putting the brand first. And secondarily, it's about global over local. Local is important. We need to understand the local needs of our customers, in Gap brand in particular that operates in over 40 countries. But this is the global approach to the business first. And this structure from my perspective has definitely been put in place to fuel long-term growth. We've had a good year so far on growth. We want to have strong growth every single year looking forward, and this structure is going to be an enabler to that kind of performance.
Now let me talk about the quarter, and I'll look at it a couple of ways, one domestically, internationally, and also give you a little bit of commentary on our growth initiatives.
Domestically, the business had an 8% comp, that was a very good performance for our domestic brands. Now what is encouraging as I talk to you about in the second quarter, this was product-led. Our product teams delivered the product to our online business, to our stores that allowed us to get to this kind of comp, and it's key categories. Everyone of our brands has been strategically saying, what's the category? This comp is an outcome. You have to have a plan across the categories where you want to differentiate yourself, how can you get a competitive advantage? Where do you want to put your inventory, your marketing? Drive those categories to get to a comp, and that's what we saw in this quarter. The other thing I want to talk to you about is we've been working on more of a wear now approach. There's been a couple of transition seasons between summer and fall, and winter and spring. I think as a business, we've lost market share. So this quarter more than anyone I've seen in our past was much better executed in that transition of product. And that's why our comps were strong in August and September.
And lastly, we had very good reg price selling. Selling more products online and in our stores at regular price is a metric we're watching closely and does talk about long-term health of the brand. On the International business, we had a minus 3% comp. Now our total sales were on par with our domestic business, and that speaks to Old Navy Japan, our China business, our franchise business, but our comp of minus 3% is something the team is focused on. We would like to see the International business improve that trajectory through the corrective measures they are taking. Let me give an update on the company's growth plans.
Our franchise team has opened in 8 countries already, with 1 more to go. So a very big year for that team in terms of number of new countries. We opened up in Japan online. So now Gap Inc. has an online presence that we control. In Europe, in Canada, in the U.S., in China and now finally, in Japan. And if our strategy, which we are so committed to multiple channels and to multiple geographies continues to produce the results we hope, this was a critical step in that direction. In China, we're very comfortable with the performance of our business. We're on track to open the number of stores we've committed ourselves to. The milestone in the third quarter was we opened 4 outlet stores in China. So in November 2010, we opened up 4 specialty stores with our online business day 1, and here we are, less than 2 years later, opening up our outlet centers in China, which we believe will be a nice opportunity in that country.
And lastly, Athleta continues to perform very well. And most encouraging in this quarter is now we've opened up stores in all different kinds of real estate. We have street stores, we have mall stores, we have lifestyle stores, we have strip centers. And what's been impressive is how well Athleta performs in everyone of them. That opens up lots of opportunities for that brand if it can perform at this level going forward in all different types of real estate, that makes the brand very flexible.
Let me close by mentioning we know it's been a very difficult time for people on the East Coast, dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Gap Inc. has 28,000 employees that were in the path of the hurricane, and what was primary to us was the safety of our employees, nothing is more important to us than that, and we're so happy that by all accounts, our employees are safe and sound. They've been impacted like so many other people. That's why I want to encourage you on the phone, if you haven't given, please give money to any cause, give to the Red Cross, give to the Salvation Army. People are in need even 3 weeks after this horrible event. We're in the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for this for many, many weeks. We know how important this quarter is. We're 2 weeks in, but this quarter now is all about execution. How we're going to execute in the stores? How we're going to execute online? How we're going to execute in our outlet channels versus our specialty channels? This is what it comes down to. I think our team has shown to continue to be even better at execution, committed to it. And this is a quarter where you want to go out, you want to have the right product, the right marketing, you want to gain share, and you want to win. And that's our goal.
So with that said, let me turn it over to Sabrina to take you through the financial performance of the third quarter."
274265,223844333,388535,"Gap Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities including: driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently",820,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities including: driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 8% and comparable sales were up 6%, with all North American divisions continuing to post positive comps. Operating margin expanded by 380 basis points to 13.5%, and earnings per share grew 66% to $0.63.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the third quarter, operating income was $520 million, up $174 million and net income was $308 million, up $115 million.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. As customers continue to respond favorably to our product, third quarter total sales were $3.9 billion, up 8%, with comp sales up 6%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 21% to $1.6 billion. Third quarter gross margin was up 450 basis points to 41.2%. Our merchandise margins were up 330 basis points, driven primarily by decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 120 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. With the benefit of average unit cost coming down during Q3, we were able to sell more units while managing our total inventory dollars tightly. As a result, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 4% at the end of the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We've noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses during 2012, and highlighted that it's likely we will deleverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, third quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up $105 million from the prior year, with an ongoing focus on the areas of marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses deleveraged by 80 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $29 million to $178 million, driven primarily by ongoing investments in Gap brand marketing and CRM.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $449 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we've opened 32 stores on a net basis year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,068 stores. Square footage was down 2% compared to Q3 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share count on Slide 10. Year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of $776 million, and we ended the third quarter with about $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Year-to-date, we spent $463 million on share repurchases, including $96 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 480 million shares outstanding.
And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress year-to-date, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week to $2.20 to $2.25. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 11% to about 12%. As a reminder, it's our objective to continue to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins.
As we lapped last year's average unit cost increases, we expect fourth quarter merchandise margins to expand.
In terms of inventory, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q4 are expected to be up in the low single-digits versus last year.
Regarding operating expenses, we plan to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Therefore, we expect the increase over last year in operating expenses in Q4 to be at least as large as the 11% increase in Q3. And as a result, we also expect to deleverage operating expenses in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to cash. We plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012. As a reminder, our third quarter weighted average diluted shares were 488 million.
Regarding our effective tax rate, we now expect our full year rate to be about 39%, down from our previous guidance of about 39.5%, driven primarily by tax credits.
The following full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged: Square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores about 15 net openings; capital expenditures about $675 million; depreciation and amortization about $475 million.
In closing, we're very pleased with how we executed against our strategies in the first 3 quarters. As we enter our most important selling season of the year, we remain committed to executing on our financial goals while continuing to make improvements and investments in our business. Thank you.
And now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

I think you have a combination of 2 things going on. We talked about this back in the call in February, our sort of refocused design, merchandise and inventory teams, about what are the key businesses that we clearly see us gaining market share on, that are right for the brand, define the customer, can be marketed properly. And as I said in my commentary, really provide either a competitive advantage because you have a product asset and a point of differentiation against our competition. So I think the teams have been very much focused on that. I think there may have been a moment in time where I think we were probably just spreading our focus a little too broadly. Now I've always been a believer that if you have a set of categories that hit all the criteria mentioned earlier, Betty, and then you can bring in new businesses and new categories, because the only way we're going to be at a comp consistently is to focus as I've said on -- about those key categories and product assets that each brand believes in while looking at new business opportunities that one day could become possibly, a product asset. So I think that it's that marriage of those 2 that allows the business to get an outcome of positive comps. Now on Gap, no big surprise. You've got the denim business, which our LA office, working with the New York office and all those teams, I really think that they've delivered since spring, a denim offering that has not only driven and lifted the overall business, but I think has been bringing in the right customer, which is critical to Gap's marketing strategy. And on top of that, another, of course, are the product asset for Gap brand is it's Baby business. I think those 2 just as examples have really helped propel the kind of comps you've seen at Gap brand and domestically. In BR, again no big surprise, suiting has been a very strong business for us. Men's and women's for the last 3 quarters, and we've complemented that with woven tops, which was stronger in men's for a long, long time, but it's nice to see this year a little bit of our investment in products has gone to women's woven tops. And that's also been a very strong business for us. At Old Navy, it's been denim, but really a focus on the Rockstar jean, which is a little bit of a higher AIR. Hopefully, through that you materialize to a higher AUR. But the fit, the colors, the marketing have all come together. That and the Kids business at Old Navy, especially in Q3, where the team I think did an exceptional job on back-to-school. So execution of the plan for the last 15 months has been good, but I think its that combination, I spoke about earlier, that's important to me being right strategically, right on the execution, looking at new business opportunities and therefore, the goal here is to have momentum on the comp performance in our global business. But in this quarter particularly, our domestic business was very strong."

This has been the best year we've had in a long time. So I've been pleased with the step up. Now that's a -- obviously, it starts with the right decisions being made on product, I was saying to Betty earlier, that all holds true towards reg price selling. I think inventory management had a tough a tough year last year. It was difficult for them with the huge increases in AUC to buy right. That probably didn't help in our goal last year even to try to get to better reg sell price. There's been some really good decisions being made. I think a little bit of that is process changes, some investment in systems, I think that has certainly helped that team. Then you have the marketing investment we're making. And then lastly, I would say that our store team have been much more focused. And I think we've been flowing the product to them that allows them to capture a better opportunity on reg price selling. So we have really been pushing new arrivals. I'm not going to give you the number, but the percentage of weeks now that Old Navy flows new product, it has -- I don't know this for a fact, but my supposition is, it has to be the highest it's ever been. The number of weeks that Old Navy receives fresh, new product. So you put that all in combination, and we've had a good year on that front. Now what I will say to you that we have a long way to go to get to the numbers I think that all 3 brands should be at. I think that's going to -- it's really going to happen through consistent performance on the product side and consistent execution and marketing. But the team's commitment, and I think our customers' response so far -- a big thing I've always believed in that we've done a decent job of, but not as well as I thought we could have, our actual initial pricing is very sharp across the different brands, different customer groups. If you look at the initial pricing at Old Navy, at Gap, at Banana Republic, it's very good. So our goal midterm and long term is to reduce our dependency on having to get off those prices because they are very good. And this is really a global strategy that you're seeing being applied much more focused now in Europe, in Japan and in China. So I think the teams are pleased with the performance so far. But to answer your question, I think this is really early days for how high the bar can be for these 3 brands on reg price selling. Now it helps having Athleta in the business because we realize how high is high, because their reg price selling is very attractive. It's been helpful too that Stefan joined the company because I think he has also been giving us a feeling from his perspective of what healthy looks like when it comes to reg price selling. So I think those are just 2 other sort of data points that have reinvigorated the team to be committed to this metric over the next number of years."

That trend still holds true. Our value businesses being made up of Banana Republic Factory Stores, Gap Outlet and Old Navy, their traffic is still noticeably stronger than it is at Banana Republic and Gap specialty stores. So I think -- if I just give you one sort of approach we're taking. Gap brand, we've been putting more marketing behind the brand since spring. And I think we've all been clear here that as we try to get more new customers, some lapped customers into the business and ultimately move that traffic metric, it's going to take a little bit of time. There's a lag effect that's going to take in Gap brand. We're committed to the marketing. We're committed to our messaging. We're committed to the new mediums, in the areas we're investing, but we -- the team knows that there's an expectation, that as we keep giving them more funds in marketing that at some point, we're going to -- at some point, we've explained to them there's a date we want to see the traffic be much -- on a much better trajectory than it's been so far in specialty. It's not a disaster. It's just not what we believe it should be long term. And that's again to help the business. As I was answering some of the questions earlier, I think when you're talking about better product and you're talking about better inventory management, focused on key categories, that again being consistently done, is the ultimate driver of better traffic. But marketing is something that we've taken very seriously this year, and we've been again, we've been pleased. There's always improvement in our value business. We've been pleased. The third quarter was I think another -- another better performance by our 3 value businesses in terms of traffic. But we'd like to see Banana Republic specialty and Gap specialty start to change the trajectory they've been on, on traffic. And so we'll watch that in Q4, and we'll see how we do."

But suffice to say, look, we -- one big one that we've talked about publicly, but it's also part of some of the performance improvement we've seen this year, and something we believe in long term will continue to add value to the business on the operating margin side, is this shift in our mix of our business towards where the customer is. And it just happens to be where we think we have a competitive advantage against our global competitors. So the customer is certainly moving more and more online. That's not a new story. But we have invested properly in that business. We will talk more in February about what our version, which I'd like to think is a little unique to the omni-channel approach that's going to be across our 3 brands, and how we've set ourselves up. And that even though we're making the change to our global structure and making online and outlet and specialty and franchise all part of one leadership team, what I said in my opening comments, I think one of the benefits of making that change is the speed of decision-making and the move on that strategic front at a faster pace than we're going to see. So we put one person in charge of all earnings across the brand, one amount of capital that, that global brand president is going to be. One thing I know about capital, it tends to go to where the biggest opportunity is. So I think the online business will grow -- continue to grow much stronger than our specialty business. But I think that even at that delta can even grow over time as we get to this new structure and start putting the infrastructure in place to execute our version of omni-channel long term. Our value business, defined as Banana Republic Factory Store and the Gap Outlet business, I think again globally, still has a long, long way to go and huge opportunity. So you may have heard us say this before, Kimberly, but I think our strategy against our global competitor is right. I think we have a competitive advantage. I think the customers are moving both aggressively and accepting more and more people going to either power centers, value centers as lifestyle centers get transitioned. Globally, again, power centers, value centers, and we have a channel that appeals to that customer to where that growth is, same with online, and we've obviously been pretty clear about this. The best return on sales and the best return on capital the company has is on those 2 channels. So I think that the new global brand presence, looking at the brand holistically will move much quicker, even though I think we've moved at a decent pace over the last 3 to 4 years. That's to execute on that strategy. I think that's going to give the company -- execute it properly, will give us nice earnings growth going forward as we change the mix of the business."

But for sure, holiday was the peak. In -- across Q4, we'll of course complete selling fall, mostly holiday, and we'll start selling spring. So there's a mix of seasons there. All of that said, it's true that holiday should have nicer tailwinds on the AUC. I think what we'll see how it works out is on the AUR, because again, it's a promotional season. We have great plans, we feel really confident about. We're going to be in there with our -- especially at Old Navy with a great lineup of promotions. But we're selling a lot more units. So that might be a bit of an offset. So yes, on the AUC, and we'll see how the AUR turns out. But margins should be healthy."

And him and Michael Francis and myself, spend a little more time together probably early in the new year discussing Old Navy and its creative platform that supports its brand positioning. And I think more than anything, as I've talked to Michael quite a bit over the last 45 days, I think Michael what he sees is an opportunity to change the mix of our marketing and maybe get a little more bang for our buck like some other brands out there. Maybe we're a little too married to our television exposure. Television and Old Navy go hand and glove. There's something about that brand, about its customers, about the audience, and how it really resonates. Hopefully, we'll see that as the television kicks in next week for Black Friday, and the weekend after Black Friday. But the creative I think, the work that Michael has done since he's been here, which is really looking not only about the creative positioning of Old Navy and all the tools and mediums available for us, but how do we get more for the money we have. So still to be determined. I think the 2 of them are spending lots of time together. Michael's adding some great value already. I think early in the new year, we'll sit down and figure that out. Obviously, I'm always a big believer that if there's a justification, and we're going to get something from it that in this case, could be whether it's traffic driving or whether we introduce a new category or there's some other reason, I'm sure we're open to it. What I also will say to you is, don't forget Old Navy in 2013 steps up a little bit more globally, and we're going to have to start looking at some marketing in the Japan market to make sure that brand gets off to a strong start. So I'd be more focused on putting some incremental money there than do anything domestically. Because again, worth repeating, I'm pretty comfortable with the amount of money they have right now."

A big area that's changed. The first step we took towards global brands was in the spring summer of 2011, with a number of changes we've made in the company structure. One that gets to the corrective measure comment you just made was to bring one International leader, Stephen Sunnucks, who is now going to be our Global President for Gap brand, and he brought all the International merchant teams together, hired an amazing lead, who's now going to run the global merchandising for him named Liz Meltzer, who has a history at J.Crew and Uniqlo. And what Liz did, and you'll start to see some of that work show up in the market just now, in our franchise business, in Europe, in Japan and in China, was really bringing all of that -- all of those teams together under one strong view on assortment architecture and pricing architecture. Now we weren't so divergent that you wouldn't know it was Gap brand. I actually in my comments at the beginning what I said was, possibly up until this year, we are a little more local at the expense of global. And that's fine. I was -- I was trying with the other executives in the business, we were all sitting back and trying to find out what is that right balance? Clearly, with some of the work we've done, some of the research, some of the customer work we've done around the world, the decision through the new structure was put global first and local second. In keeping with that, the work that Liz under Stephen's leadership have put forward is that, you will see now a much more consistent approach in our assortment around the world, not identical because we are such believers in local opportunities. What I believe is going to happen now is, they will now be able to go, instead of an inch deep and a mile long, they will be able to go an inch wide and a mile deep on what really differentiates Japan from China, from Europe, from some of our key franchise markets. That work is already beginning. Now we're not going to get a huge benefit in the fourth quarter, but I am expecting that some of the changes they've made will be the beginning of some of the course correction action. That, coupled with our pricing, I was talking earlier that we've actually pretty good with our initial pricing. I actually feel in North America, we're highly competitive for the customers we're going after against the competitive sets of each one of our brands. I probably couldn't say that with as much confidence internationally until now. And I do think that again, under the leadership of Stephen and Liz, our International business is much more competitive in this fourth quarter, and therefore, going forward with its pricing architecture. So those 2 of many actions that have been taken while Stephen led the International business, hopefully will start to change the trajectory we've seen in that business for the last, I don't know, 5 or 6 quarters now."

One of the big benefits we're going to get is that in a more common approach as we shift to, as I said earlier to the global local approach to our business, the Gap brand in particular across over 40 countries. We've actually, since 2007, I'd say let's call it to the service functions in the business between finance and HR and real estate and supply chain and IT. I think the business under Sabrina's leadership have done a great job making a very efficient service model to the brands in place. And those services were already global. So the infrastructure on which the brand sits were already global, and we're leveraged, and we've been doing a great job on that front. This was a change related to brand level only. It will sit on the exact same infrastructure we had before of shared services, where we've continued to actually get great benefit and efficiency from that. So this is really a change that I think is customer facing, that will get the benefits I talked about earlier. Now you have 3 significant leaders who run all of our big iconic brands, and I think that it's early days. Those teams don't officially start working together until the new fiscal year, but we're confident that we're going to get the outcomes I talked about earlier."

Both in Europe and in Japan, I'd say our Banana Republic business, our online business, and our factory store value business is doing quite well. And not in that order. Well, obviously, online businesses which are young in both the 27 countries we serve in Europe. And as I said earlier, Japan just opened a month ago. But earlier indications of Japan are very positive. The online business in Europe is very strong. And look, we've been making the same sort of approach that we've had here in the U.S. Making sure the stores are right. Focusing on key cities in Europe. Making sure we're investing and remodeling the stores that make sense, and we're going to hold on to long term. And as the customer starts to return, and I would not say in Europe we're seeing any signs of that just yet. There's some numbers just came out in the U.K. And once again, the customer apparel numbers were soft in the U.K. for October. So there's no -- there's no great sign right now in Europe. You saw H&M's numbers that came out today. So we don't have a large business there. We have an important business. We're keeping it tight. We're investing in our value sector and online, and that's it for now until we see signs of real improvement inside of Europe. In Japan, where the consumer is slightly better, our Old Navy business, as you said, is 1 store only. We'll comment in February about how many stores we're going to open for Old Navy in 2013. But we feel very good about the first store. Online I think will be an amazing add-on to the bricks business we have right now. And there, again, it's Gap specialty. The team is on it. I was answering John's question earlier, I think some of the work that Liz Meltzer has brought to the business, early indications will be in 2013, about how that change -- those corrective measures are going to take place. A little bit in the fourth quarter, but I think we've taken a lot of steps to get our International business performing at a higher level for Gap specialty. That's certainly not been an area we've been pleased about. But I think the team we have confidence in, and they're going to take some of those ideas now. They're going to go into the brands, and I believe the brands will execute that strategy and find even more ways to make sure that our International business performs better in 2013 on a top line basis than we've experienced so far in 2012. But more to come on that front."

But again, in fairness, 2011 was a very difficult year for our inventory management team with this change in -- of this paradigm shift of average unit cost to inventory units that they bought. Having said that, I really think that the process changes I'm seeing driven at Old Navy, but some of this applies to Gap specialty and Gap Outlet, Banana Republic Factory Store and Banana Republic specialty business, that the inventory teams I think are doing a much better job in 2012, and I'm actually feeling that any system investments -- and look, everybody is always putting some kind of money to their inventory management system. I think that we're just making sure those teams have all the right tools. But as we look, and we'll talk more about this in the new year, as we look at our business because right now, we've been talking about how inventory can be viewed more seamless from a customer perspective between channels. So we've been doing a little bit of that work right now on our ship-from-store strategy, which allows us to take product that is in demand online and ship it from one of our stores. So we've done a lot of work on that front. We'll talk more about that in the new year. But I think one of the next moves even though there's been some small investments that have been helpful in 2012. The big shift for us is how do start treating our inventory that's seamless to a customer across channels of online and specialty, and across geographies most importantly. I think that's going to be critical looking forward for a business like ours. And there's a lot of value to be created by doing that. And Stefan, look, it's 30 days. I just think that, we didn't hire him to come in and just oversee the status quo. We brought him into the business because we believe his experience, which is phenomenal, and his view of retailing, whose knowledge of specialty retail and of fashion in particular. His work he has done on processes and making sure that company's like ours learn to move faster because that's really going to be important going forward. The customer is moving fast, therefore we have to respond by moving equally as fast. I think that early days, but I'm just impressed with some of the observations that he's making, and I'm sure as shareholders and investors on the phone turn to 2013, there'll be an opportunity for everybody to meet him. And I'm sure he'll be happy to share some of his observations, what he thinks is great about Old Navy, which obviously, that includes a lot about the brand and its positioning. But what are some of the opportunities that he thinks he's going to put into place and what speed to create incremental value for shareholders."

We're thinking we'll end this year on our domestic real estate strategy. I'll come back to Europe in a second. But our domestic real estate strategy will end this year in the 7 rate inning [ph] of the plan we outlined to investors in 2008, so I think -- hats off to our real estate team who have done a phenomenal job. So by the end of '13, I think when you look at square footage reductions at Old Navy, I think we'll pretty much be there. We look at Gap closures, pure closures and then consolidations, I think we'll pretty much be there. Banana Republic was never a big change, but there's some changes that were necessary in Jack Calhoun's fleet. Those are for the most part done. And I think that the move now domestically is to look at these missed opportunities for the Gap Outlet business and the factory store business. We just opened up a store in Fulton Street in New York City, where the specialty business would not get the kind of customer traffic it needs given its value proposition. We put in a Gap Factory Store there, and it's doing phenomenally well. So I think that as we've tightened up the real estate for all the right reasons, there's a few opportunities still available for us domestically. And when Katrina was giving out or maybe when Sabrina was giving out the net number of stores in the quarter, I always think about, this is a year where we're going to open close to 200 stores. But we have a lot of closures this year because this was a very big year for us for closures. We have one more year to go of repositioning in 2013 and meaningful number of closures, probably not as high as '12, but we'll give you that information in February in 2013. And then we'll be able to be in a place where we're not operating like we had the last 4 years, with quite a few closures per year that dragged down the company's total sales. So I think that good performance by the real estate team, I'll deal with 2 issues that you brought up at the end. Remodels, we're still very happy with the remodel work at Old Navy. I'm sure Stefan will have a point of view on that, but we've been very happy at the work that's been done. We've been very happy with the Gap global model. We just opened on 34 Street in New York, just reopened beautiful store doing very well. So very happy with how that store looks and how it's coming across. I think Jack Calhoun has continued to tweak the remodel prototype for Banana Republic. So I think that it's good, but I think he is tweaking it. So I think we feel good about our models. Athleta, obviously, is very strong. And lastly, if I was to say there was one area where productivity is the hugest -- sorry, is the most significant opportunity for us on productivity, that would be at Gap brand specialty. All our brands have an opportunity on productivity, but Gap brand specialty, with a repositioned fleet now in terms of number of stores and square footage, I got to believe Mark Breitbard is looking at that and going, that's the biggest opportunity for him is to get better productivity in his new fleet."

Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, I do want to talk about the quarter and the performance of Gap Inc. in Q3. I want to talk about the announcement from a month ago of the move of Gap Inc. to global brands. So let me start with that.
A month ago, we announced that our business made a structural change that will be effective in February 2013. In 2008, Gap Inc. was an American-centric channel led business. That was completely the appropriate structure for that time. But we've been on a journey. We have been moving the company at a pace that we're comfortable with, you could never go from an American-centric organization to global brands without having stores in China, without having online that was launched globally, without having outlet stores internationally. As those proof points came together, it made sense, this was the right time to move to a global brand structure.
This was driven by the customer. Customers clearly are becoming more and more global. As we go around the world and all of us travel, there's more in common than I've ever seen between a customer in New York, in London, in Tokyo and Toronto and Istanbul. So from our perspective, looking at our business globally is very important, to have one lens, one management team looking at the brand across all different channels in all different international countries. What we're expecting to get out of this change is speed, for sure, with one team deciding across every touch point we have to the customer. We're going to get more efficiency, which is critical. This change definitely puts the brand ahead of channels. Channels are important. And the corporate strategy has been clearly identified as multiple channels. But this is putting the brand first. And secondarily, it's about global over local. Local is important. We need to understand the local needs of our customers, in Gap brand in particular that operates in over 40 countries. But this is the global approach to the business first. And this structure from my perspective has definitely been put in place to fuel long-term growth. We've had a good year so far on growth. We want to have strong growth every single year looking forward, and this structure is going to be an enabler to that kind of performance.
Now let me talk about the quarter, and I'll look at it a couple of ways, one domestically, internationally, and also give you a little bit of commentary on our growth initiatives.
Domestically, the business had an 8% comp, that was a very good performance for our domestic brands. Now what is encouraging as I talk to you about in the second quarter, this was product-led. Our product teams delivered the product to our online business, to our stores that allowed us to get to this kind of comp, and it's key categories. Everyone of our brands has been strategically saying, what's the category? This comp is an outcome. You have to have a plan across the categories where you want to differentiate yourself, how can you get a competitive advantage? Where do you want to put your inventory, your marketing? Drive those categories to get to a comp, and that's what we saw in this quarter. The other thing I want to talk to you about is we've been working on more of a wear now approach. There's been a couple of transition seasons between summer and fall, and winter and spring. I think as a business, we've lost market share. So this quarter more than anyone I've seen in our past was much better executed in that transition of product. And that's why our comps were strong in August and September.
And lastly, we had very good reg price selling. Selling more products online and in our stores at regular price is a metric we're watching closely and does talk about long-term health of the brand. On the International business, we had a minus 3% comp. Now our total sales were on par with our domestic business, and that speaks to Old Navy Japan, our China business, our franchise business, but our comp of minus 3% is something the team is focused on. We would like to see the International business improve that trajectory through the corrective measures they are taking. Let me give an update on the company's growth plans.
Our franchise team has opened in 8 countries already, with 1 more to go. So a very big year for that team in terms of number of new countries. We opened up in Japan online. So now Gap Inc. has an online presence that we control. In Europe, in Canada, in the U.S., in China and now finally, in Japan. And if our strategy, which we are so committed to multiple channels and to multiple geographies continues to produce the results we hope, this was a critical step in that direction. In China, we're very comfortable with the performance of our business. We're on track to open the number of stores we've committed ourselves to. The milestone in the third quarter was we opened 4 outlet stores in China. So in November 2010, we opened up 4 specialty stores with our online business day 1, and here we are, less than 2 years later, opening up our outlet centers in China, which we believe will be a nice opportunity in that country.
And lastly, Athleta continues to perform very well. And most encouraging in this quarter is now we've opened up stores in all different kinds of real estate. We have street stores, we have mall stores, we have lifestyle stores, we have strip centers. And what's been impressive is how well Athleta performs in everyone of them. That opens up lots of opportunities for that brand if it can perform at this level going forward in all different types of real estate, that makes the brand very flexible.
Let me close by mentioning we know it's been a very difficult time for people on the East Coast, dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Gap Inc. has 28,000 employees that were in the path of the hurricane, and what was primary to us was the safety of our employees, nothing is more important to us than that, and we're so happy that by all accounts, our employees are safe and sound. They've been impacted like so many other people. That's why I want to encourage you on the phone, if you haven't given, please give money to any cause, give to the Red Cross, give to the Salvation Army. People are in need even 3 weeks after this horrible event. We're in the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for this for many, many weeks. We know how important this quarter is. We're 2 weeks in, but this quarter now is all about execution. How we're going to execute in the stores? How we're going to execute online? How we're going to execute in our outlet channels versus our specialty channels? This is what it comes down to. I think our team has shown to continue to be even better at execution, committed to it. And this is a quarter where you want to go out, you want to have the right product, the right marketing, you want to gain share, and you want to win. And that's our goal.
So with that said, let me turn it over to Sabrina to take you through the financial performance of the third quarter."
274265,223844333,388579,"Gap Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities including: driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently",820,"Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities including: driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently investing in our business and growing earnings per share.
Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 8% and comparable sales were up 6%, with all North American divisions continuing to post positive comps. Operating margin expanded by 380 basis points to 13.5%, and earnings per share grew 66% to $0.63.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the third quarter, operating income was $520 million, up $174 million and net income was $308 million, up $115 million.
Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. As customers continue to respond favorably to our product, third quarter total sales were $3.9 billion, up 8%, with comp sales up 6%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 21% to $1.6 billion. Third quarter gross margin was up 450 basis points to 41.2%. Our merchandise margins were up 330 basis points, driven primarily by decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 120 basis points.
Turning to inventory on Slide 7. With the benefit of average unit cost coming down during Q3, we were able to sell more units while managing our total inventory dollars tightly. As a result, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 4% at the end of the third quarter.
Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We've noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses during 2012, and highlighted that it's likely we will de-leverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, third quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up $105 million from the prior year, with an ongoing focus on the areas of marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses de-leveraged by 80 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $29 million to $178 million, driven primarily by ongoing investments in Gap brand marketing and CRM.
Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $449 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we've opened 32 stores on a net basis year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,068 stores. Square footage was down 2% compared to Q3 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.
Regarding cash and share count on Slide 10. Year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of $776 million, and we ended the third quarter with about $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Year-to-date, we spent $463 million on share repurchases, including $96 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 480 million shares outstanding.
And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress year-to-date, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week to $2.20 to $2.25. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 11% to about 12%. As a reminder, it's our objective to continue to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins.
As we lapped last year's average unit cost increases, we expect fourth quarter merchandise margins to expand.
In terms of inventory, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q4 are expected to be up in the low single-digits versus last year.
Regarding operating expenses, we plan to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Therefore, we expect the increase over last year in operating expenses in Q4 to be at least as large as the 11% increase in Q3. And as a result, we also expect to de-leverage operating expenses in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to cash. We plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012. As a reminder, our third quarter weighted average diluted shares were 488 million.
Regarding our effective tax rate, we now expect our full year rate to be about 39%, down from our previous guidance of about 39.5%, driven primarily by tax credits.
The following full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged: Square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores about 15 net openings; capital expenditures about $675 million; depreciation and amortization about $475 million.
In closing, we're very pleased with how we executed against our strategies in the first 3 quarters. As we enter our most important selling season of the year, we remain committed to executing on our financial goals while continuing to make improvements and investments in our business. Thank you.
And now I'll turn it over to Katrina."

I think you have a combination of 2 things going on. We talked about this back in the call in February, our sort of refocused design, merchandise and inventory teams, about what are the key businesses that we clearly see us gaining market share on, that are right for the brand, define the customer, can be marketed properly. And as I said in my commentary, really provide either a competitive advantage because you have a product asset and a point of differentiation against our competition. So I think the teams have been very much focused on that. I think there may have been a moment in time where I think we were probably just spreading our focus a little too broadly. Now I've always been a believer that if you have a set of categories that hit all the criteria mentioned earlier, Betty, and then you can bring in new businesses and new categories, because the only way we're going to be at a comp consistently is to focus as I've said on -- about those key categories and product assets that each brand believes in while looking at new business opportunities that one day could become possibly, a product asset. So I think that it's that marriage of those 2 that allows the business to get an outcome of positive comps. Now on Gap, no big surprise. You've got the denim business, which our LA office, working with the New York office and all those teams, I really think that they've delivered since spring, a denim offering that has not only driven and lifted the overall business, but I think has been bringing in the right customer, which is critical to Gap's marketing strategy. And on top of that, another, of course, are the product asset for Gap brand is it's Baby business. I think those 2 just as examples have really helped propel the kind of comps you've seen at Gap brand and domestically. In BR, again no big surprise, suiting has been a very strong business for us. Men's and women's for the last 3 quarters, and we've complemented that with woven tops, which was stronger in men's for a long, long time, but it's nice to see this year a little bit of our investment in products has gone to women's woven tops. And that's also been a very strong business for us. At Old Navy, it's been denim, but really a focus on the Rockstar jean, which is a little bit of a higher AIR. Hopefully, through that you materialize to a higher AUR. But the fit, the colors, the marketing have all come together. That and the Kids business at Old Navy, especially in Q3, where the team I think did an exceptional job on back-to-school. So execution of the plan for the last 15 months has been good, but I think it's that combination, I spoke about earlier, that's important to me being right strategically, right on the execution, looking at new business opportunities and therefore, the goal here is to have momentum on the comp performance in our global business. But in this quarter particularly, our domestic business was very strong."

This has been the best year we've had in a long time. So I've been pleased with the step up. Now that's a -- obviously, it starts with the right decisions being made on product, I was saying to Betty earlier, that all holds true towards reg price selling. I think inventory management had a tough a tough year last year. It was difficult for them with the huge increases in AUC to buy right. That probably didn't help in our goal last year even to try to get to better reg sell price. There's been some really good decisions being made. I think a little bit of that is process changes, some investment in systems, I think that has certainly helped that team. Then you have the marketing investment we're making. And then lastly, I would say that our store team have been much more focused. And I think we've been flowing the product to them that allows them to capture a better opportunity on reg price selling. So we have really been pushing new arrivals. I'm not going to give you the number, but the percentage of weeks now that Old Navy flows new product, it has -- I don't know this for a fact, but my supposition is, it has to be the highest it's ever been. The number of weeks that Old Navy receives fresh, new product. So you put that all in combination, and we've had a good year on that front. Now what I will say to you that we have a long way to go to get to the numbers I think that all 3 brands should be at. I think that's going to -- it's really going to happen through consistent performance on the product side and consistent execution and marketing. But the team's commitment, and I think our customers' response so far -- a big thing I've always believed in that we've done a decent job of, but not as well as I thought we could have, our actual initial pricing is very sharp across the different brands, different customer groups. If you look at the initial pricing at Old Navy, at Gap, at Banana Republic, it's very good. So our goal midterm and long term is to reduce our dependency on having to get off those prices because they are very good. And this is really a global strategy that you're seeing being applied much more focused now in Europe, in Japan and in China. So I think the teams are pleased with the performance so far. But to answer your question, I think this is really early days for how high the bar can be for these 3 brands on reg price selling. Now it helps having Athleta in the business because we realize how high is high, because their reg price selling is very attractive. It's been helpful too that Stefan joined the company because I think he has also been giving us a feeling from his perspective of what healthy looks like when it comes to reg price selling. So I think those are just 2 other sort of data points that have reinvigorated the team to be committed to this metric over the next number of years."

That trend still holds true. Our value businesses being made up of Banana Republic Factory Stores, Gap Outlet and Old Navy, their traffic is still noticeably stronger than it is at Banana Republic and Gap specialty stores. So I think -- if I just give you one sort of approach we're taking. Gap brand, we've been putting more marketing behind the brand since spring. And I think we've all been clear here that as we try to get more new customers, some lapsed customers into the business and ultimately move that traffic metric, it's going to take a little bit of time. There's a lag effect that's going to take in Gap brand. We're committed to the marketing. We're committed to our messaging. We're committed to the new mediums, in the areas we're investing, but we -- the team knows that there's an expectation, that as we keep giving them more funds in marketing that at some point, we're going to -- at some point, we've explained to them there's a date we want to see the traffic be much -- on a much better trajectory than it's been so far in specialty. It's not a disaster. It's just not what we believe it should be long term. And that's again the health of the business. As I was answering some of the questions earlier, I think when you're talking about better product and you're talking about better inventory management, focused on key categories, that again being consistently done, is the ultimate driver of better traffic. But marketing is something that we've taken very seriously this year, and we've been again, we've been pleased. There's always improvement in our value business. We've been pleased. The third quarter was I think another -- another better performance by our 3 value businesses in terms of traffic. But we'd like to see Banana Republic specialty and Gap specialty start to change the trajectory they've been on, on traffic. And so we'll watch that in Q4, and we'll see how we do."

But suffice to say, look, we -- one big one that we've talked about publicly, but it's also part of some of the performance improvement we've seen this year, and something we believe in long term will continue to add value to the business on the operating margin side, is this shift in our mix of our business towards where the customer is. And it just happens to be where we think we have a competitive advantage against our global competitors. So the customer is certainly moving more and more online. That's not a new story. But we have invested properly in that business. We will talk more in February about what our version, which I'd like to think is a little unique to the omni-channel approach that's going to be across our 3 brands, and how we've set ourselves up. And that even though we're making the change to our global structure and making online and outlet and specialty and franchise all part of one leadership team, what I said in my opening comments, I think one of the benefits of making that change is the speed of decision-making and the move on that strategic front at a faster pace than we're going to see. So we put one person in charge of all earnings across the brand, one amount of capital that, that global brand president is going to be. One thing I know about capital, it tends to go to where the biggest opportunity is. So I think the online business will grow -- continue to grow much stronger than our specialty business. But I think that even at that delta can even grow over time as we get to this new structure and start putting the infrastructure in place to execute our version of omni-channel long term. Our value business, defined as Banana Republic Factory Store and the Gap Outlet business, I think again globally, still has a long, long way to go and huge opportunity. So you may have heard us say this before, Kimberly, but I think our strategy against our global competitor is right. I think we have a competitive advantage. I think the customers are moving both aggressively and accepting more and more people going to either power centers, value centers as lifestyle centers get transitioned. Globally, again, power centers, value centers, and we have a channel that appeals to that customer to where that growth is, same with online, and we've obviously been pretty clear about this. The best return on sales and the best return on capital the company has is on those 2 channels. So I think that the new global brand presence, looking at the brand holistically will move much quicker, even though I think we've moved at a decent pace over the last 3 to 4 years. That's to execute on that strategy. I think that's going to give the company -- execute it properly, will give us nice earnings growth going forward as we change the mix of the business."

It's really that we're comping a year that was unusual in '11. With that very high average unit cost, we pulled out a lot of units because from a total cost inventory perspective, we didn't want that ballooning too much. So this year, with that coming down, we're actually trying to just reintroduce units to a level which are more comfortable from any historical velocity level that we would see at Old Navy. Now of course, our hope in all of that is to continue as our overall goal is for the company, is to continue to positive comp in a manner that has us gaining some market share. So that is our overall goal. But we want to do that with healthy margins. And we think with this average unit costing providing us some nice tailwind, we don't need a very large increase in AUR to still give us obviously, nice margin expansion. So that's sort of the formula. Delivering a nice, positive comp is the goal that gives us some market share in a way that also provides very healthy merchandise margins."

All of that said, it's true that holiday should have nicer tailwinds on the AUC. I think what we'll see how it works out is on the AUR, because again, it's a promotional season. We have great plans, we feel really confident about. We're going to be in there with our -- especially at Old Navy with a great lineup of promotions. But we're selling a lot more units.

And him and Michael Francis and myself, spend a little more time together probably early in the new year discussing Old Navy and its creative platform that supports its brand positioning. And I think more than anything, as I've talked to Michael quite a bit over the last 45 days, I think Michael what he sees is an opportunity to change the mix of our marketing and maybe get a little more bang for our buck like some other brands out there. Maybe we're a little too married to our television exposure. Television and Old Navy go hand and glove. There's something about that brand, about its customers, about the audience, and how it really resonates. Hopefully, we'll see that as the television kicks in next week for Black Friday, and the weekend after Black Friday. But the creative I think, the work that Michael has done since he's been here, which is really looking not only about the creative positioning of Old Navy and all the tools and mediums available for us, but how do we get more for the money we have. So still to be determined. I think the 2 of them are spending lots of time together. Michael's adding some great value already. I think early in the new year, we'll sit down and figure that out. Obviously, I'm always a big believer that if there's a justification, and we're going to get something from it that in this case, could be whether it's traffic driving or whether we introduce a new category or there's some other reason, I'm sure we're open to it. What I also will say to you is, don't forget Old Navy in 2013 steps up a little bit more globally, and we're going to have to start looking at some marketing in the Japan market to make sure that brand gets off to a strong start. So I'd be more focused on putting some incremental money there than do anything domestically. Because again, worth repeating, I'm pretty comfortable with the amount of money they have right now."

A big area that's changed. The first step we took towards global brands was in the spring summer of 2011, with a number of changes we've made in the company structure. One that gets to the corrective measure comment you just made was to bring one International leader, Stephen Sunnucks, who is now going to be our Global President for Gap brand, and he brought all the International merchant teams together, hired an amazing lead, who's now going to run the global merchandising for him named Liz Meltzer, who has a history at J.Crew and Uniqlo. And what Liz did, and you'll start to see some of that work show up in the market just now, in our franchise business, in Europe, in Japan and in China, was really bringing all of that -- all of those teams together under one strong view on assortment architecture and pricing architecture. Now we weren't so divergent that you wouldn't know it was Gap brand. I actually in my comments at the beginning what I said was, possibly up until this year, we are a little more local at the expense of global. And that's fine. I was -- I was trying with the other executives in the business, we were all sitting back and trying to find out what is that right balance? Clearly, with some of the work we've done, some of the research, some of the customer work we've done around the world, the decision through the new structure was put global first and local second. In keeping with that, the work that Liz under Stephen's leadership have put forward is that, you will see now a much more consistent approach in our assortment around the world, not identical because we are such believers in local opportunities. What I believe is going to happen now is, they will now be able to go, instead of an inch deep and a mile long, they will be able to go an inch wide and a mile deep on what really differentiates Japan from China, from Europe, from some of our key franchise markets. That work is already beginning. Now we're not going to get a huge benefit in the fourth quarter, but I am expecting that some of the changes they've made will be the beginning of some of the course correction action. That, coupled with our pricing, I was talking earlier that we've actually pretty good with our initial pricing. I actually feel in North America, we're highly competitive for the customers we're going after against the competitive sets of each one of our brands. I probably couldn't say that with as much confidence internationally until now. And I do think that again, under the leadership of Stephen and Liz, our International business is much more competitive in this fourth quarter, and therefore, going forward with its pricing architecture. So those 2 of many actions that have been taken while Stephen led the International business, hopefully will start to change the trajectory we've seen in that business for the last, I don't know, 5 or 6 quarters now."

We've actually, since 2007, I'd say let's call it to the service functions in the business between finance and HR and real estate and supply chain and IT. I think the business under Sabrina's leadership have done a great job making a very efficient service model to the brands in place. And those services were already global. So the infrastructure on which the brand sits were already global, and we're leveraged, and we've been doing a great job on that front. This was a change related to brand level only. It will sit on the exact same infrastructure we had before of shared services, where we've continued to actually get great benefit and efficiency from that. So this is really a change that I think is customer facing, that will get the benefits I talked about earlier. Now you have 3 significant leaders who run all of our big iconic brands, and I think that it's early days.

Well, obviously, online businesses which are young in both the 27 countries we serve in Europe. And as I said earlier, Japan just opened a month ago. But earlier indications of Japan are very positive. The online business in Europe is very strong. And look, we've been making the same sort of approach that we've had here in the U.S. Making sure the stores are right. Focusing on key cities in Europe. Making sure we're investing and remodeling the stores that make sense, and we're going to hold on to long term. And as the customer starts to return, and I would not say in Europe we're seeing any signs of that just yet. There's some numbers just came out in the U.K. And once again, the customer apparel numbers were soft in the U.K. for October. So there's no -- there's no great sign right now in Europe. You saw H&M's numbers that came out today. So we don't have a large business there. We have an important business. We're keeping it tight. We're investing in our value sector and online, and that's it for now until we see signs of real improvement inside of Europe. In Japan, where the consumer is slightly better, our Old Navy business, as you said, is 1 store only. We'll comment in February about how many stores we're going to open for Old Navy in 2013. But we feel very good about the first store. Online I think will be an amazing add-on to the bricks business we have right now. And there, again, it's Gap specialty. The team is on it. I was answering John's question earlier, I think some of the work that Liz Meltzer has brought to the business, early indications will be in 2013, about how that change -- those corrective measures are going to take place. A little bit in the fourth quarter, but I think we've taken a lot of steps to get our International business performing at a higher level for Gap specialty. That's certainly not been an area we've been pleased about. But I think the team we have confidence in, and they're going to take some of those ideas now. They're going to go into the brands, and I believe the brands will execute that strategy and find even more ways to make sure that our International business performs better in 2013 on a top line basis than we've experienced so far in 2012.

But again, in fairness, 2011 was a very difficult year for our inventory management team with this change in -- of this paradigm shift of average unit cost to inventory units that they bought. Having said that, I really think that the process changes I'm seeing driven at Old Navy, but some of this applies to Gap specialty and Gap Outlet, Banana Republic Factory Store and Banana Republic specialty business, that the inventory teams I think are doing a much better job in 2012, and I'm actually feeling that any system investments -- and look, everybody is always putting some kind of money to their inventory management system. I think that we're just making sure those teams have all the right tools. But as we look, and we'll talk more about this in the new year, as we look at our business because right now, we've been talking about how inventory can be viewed more seamless from a customer perspective between channels. So we've been doing a little bit of that work right now on our ship-from-store strategy, which allows us to take product that is in demand online and ship it from one of our stores. So we've done a lot of work on that front. We'll talk more about that in the new year. But I think one of the next moves even though there's been some small investments that have been helpful in 2012. The big shift for us is how do start treating our inventory that's seamless to a customer across channels of online and specialty, and across geographies most importantly. I think that's going to be critical looking forward for a business like ours. And there's a lot of value to be created by doing that. And Stefan, look, it's 30 days. I just think that, we didn't hire him to come in and just oversee the status quo. We brought him into the business because we believe his experience, which is phenomenal, and his view of retailing, whose knowledge of specialty retail and of fashion in particular. His work he has done on processes and making sure that company's like ours learn to move faster because that's really going to be important going forward. The customer is moving fast, therefore we have to respond by moving equally as fast. I think that early days, but I'm just impressed with some of the observations that he's making, and I'm sure as shareholders and investors on the phone turn to 2013, there'll be an opportunity for everybody to meet him. And I'm sure he'll be happy to share some of his observations, what he thinks is great about Old Navy, which obviously, that includes a lot about the brand and its positioning. But what are some of the opportunities that he thinks he's going to put into place and what speed to create incremental value for shareholders."

We're thinking we'll end this year on our domestic real estate strategy. I'll come back to Europe in a second. But our domestic real estate strategy will end this year in the 7 or 8 inning of the plan we outlined to investors in 2008, so I think -- hats off to our real estate team who have done a phenomenal job. So by the end of '13, I think when you look at square footage reductions at Old Navy, I think we'll pretty much be there. We look at Gap closures, pure closures and then consolidations, I think we'll pretty much be there. Banana Republic was never a big change, but there's some changes that were necessary in Jack Calhoun's fleet. Those are for the most part done. And I think that the move now domestically is to look at these missed opportunities for the Gap Outlet business and the factory store business. We just opened up a store in Fulton Street in New York City, where the specialty business would not get the kind of customer traffic it needs given its value proposition. We put in a Gap Factory Store there, and it's doing phenomenally well. So I think that as we've tightened up the real estate for all the right reasons, there's a few opportunities still available for us domestically. And when Katrina was giving out or maybe when Sabrina was giving out the net number of stores in the quarter, I always think about, this is a year where we're going to open close to 200 stores. But we have a lot of closures this year because this was a very big year for us for closures. We have one more year to go of repositioning in 2013 and meaningful number of closures, probably not as high as '12, but we'll give you that information in February in 2013. And then we'll be able to be in a place where we're not operating like we had the last 4 years, with quite a few closures per year that dragged down the company's total sales. So I think that good performance by the real estate team -- I'll deal with 2 issues that you brought up at the end. Remodels, we're still very happy with the remodel work at Old Navy. I'm sure Stefan will have a point of view on that, but we've been very happy at the work that's been done. We've been very happy with the Gap global model. We just opened on 34 Street in New York, just reopened beautiful store doing very well. So very happy with how that store looks and how it's coming across. I think Jack Calhoun has continued to tweak the remodel prototype for Banana Republic. So I think that it's good, but I think he is tweaking it. So I think we feel good about our models. Athleta, obviously, is very strong. And lastly, if I was to say there was one area where productivity is the hugest -- sorry, is the most significant opportunity for us on productivity, that would be at Gap brand specialty. All our brands have an opportunity on productivity, but Gap brand specialty, with a repositioned fleet now in terms of number of stores and square footage, I got to believe Mark Breitbard is looking at that and going, that's the biggest opportunity for him is to get better productivity in his new fleet."

So we still have lots of great sourcing strategies ahead of us. So we're never done looking for opportunities to get optimal costing using fabric platforming, our new category management. So we have lots of tools within sourcing to keep optimizing costing. But certainly, we're not going to have the magnitude of tailwind that we've been experiencing this year. We obviously, are focused on great assortments. So part of the sustainability of moving forward with our positive comps, which is our objective, is going to be to keep making investments in those smart areas, where we think we can get the average unit retail for it. So we keep those healthy margins. But mostly, it's going to be a continuation of healthy product acceptance and modestly introducing more unit sales once we've achieved that healthy merchandise margin, so we're growing our gross margin. So that's going to be the recipe going forward into '13, and we'll give more details as we enter that year."
