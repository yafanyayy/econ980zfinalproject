It’s a pleasure to speak with you today from (inaudible), where we will meet with agents this afternoon. This is the fourth state among 22 in total that we are visiting during the first and second quarters. Our agents with their optimism,",1009,"Good morning. It’s a pleasure to speak with you today from (inaudible), where we will meet with agents this afternoon. This is the fourth state among 22 in total that we are visiting during the first and second quarters. Our agents with their optimism, their commitment to our partnership and share goals really energize us. After three state quarters of heavy catastrophe losses, the fourth quarter was profitable, with commercial line, personal line, excess of surplus lines, life insurance and investments all contributing to strong operating earnings. Essentially, all our indicators of longer-term performance are moving in the right direction and that bodes well for creating shareholder value.
Various strategic initiatives are having a positive effect and I’ll highlight several key areas.
As we discussed during our last quarterly conference call, better insurance pricings is a top priority. We are experiencing improvement through a combination of our diligence, plus somewhat more favorable conditions in several markets. Our pricing precision for each policy continues to improve as we gain more experience with our pricing models.
More thinly price risks are getting significantly higher prices. Fourth quarter increases in renewal pricing occurred for each property casualty segment and also, for each major line of business within segments.
As we pre-announced, commercial lines renewal pricing accelerated during the quarter with average increases in the low to mid-single digit range. Just over 80% of our commercial lines renewed at flat or higher prices. For our excess of surplus line segment, renewal prices continue to increase and are solidly in the mid-single digit range.
Pricing changes for that segment have been positive for the last 16 consecutive months. For personal lines, we believe our 10% increase in 2011 renewal premiums is roughly half from higher rates and half from higher policy accounts. Policy retention has remain fairly steady over the past two years with fourth quarter retention in the high upper 80% range for commercialized policies, and then our low to mid 90% range for personal line policies. Our agents are able to sell the value of our products and services. They continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed.
The market remains competitive, particularly for new business, while agencies appointed since the beginning of 2010, drove our 6% new business premium increase for 2011. New business written premiums for agents appointed prior to 2010 decreased approximately 2%.
We are seeing plenty of opportunities to grow profitably and are comfortable declining new business opportunities we believe are underpriced. We also continue to gain confidence that our pricing analytics are helping us to distinguish the more attractive new business offerings from the last attractive ones.
In 2011, we appointed 133 new agencies in areas we consider unreserved about a dozen more than we planned at the beginning of the year. During 2012, we planned to appoint around 130 agencies. It takes several years for our new agency to develop the double-digit market share we enjoyed with agencies appointed for 10 years or longer. The accelerated pace of appointments in recent years, plus our commitment to serving all our agencies and our clients put us on a path where we believe we can achieve $5 billion of direct written premium by 2015.
Above all, our emphasize on premium growth is to do so profitably, in order to raise the level of earnings and book value over the long-term.
Our life insurance business also grew in 2011 with earned premiums up 4%; term life, the largest product line rose 9%. Although, life insurance profits remain challenged by the low interest rate environment, our agencies value the ability to offer quality like products and services to their commercial and personal insurance clients.
The year 2011 will be remembered by many for its violent weather and other natural catastrophes. From a financial perspective, our unprecedented catastrophe losses in 2011 were an earnings event rather than a capital event, as we ended the year with higher shareholders equity than at the start of the year.
An important risk management element for keeping our capital strong is an effective reinsurance program, and we have renewed all our primary reinsurance to use for 2012. For our (inaudible) treaties property rates were up approximately 10% and casualty rates were down around 5%.
We chose to add $100 million more to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage, rating it to $600 million per event and we now retain the first $75 million of loss. For our $500 million event, our net retention is $115 million compared with the $88 million in 2011 and $104 million in 2010.
Assuming stable levels of facultative reinsurance, we estimate that our total 2012 premiums (inaudible) to reinsurers will be approximately $181 million down roughly 16% from 2011 and up about 8% from 2010.
Another important aspect of 2011 high-level catastrophe activity was that it allowed us to showcase our expertise in providing client service. I can thoroughly stand up about how well our claims staff performed and about how our claims response and other elements of our service play an integral role in our ability to profitably grow the company.
We aim to give policyholders consistent value and service through all these storms and we believe shareholders deserve consistency too. The payment of our dividend to shareholders last October marked our 51st consecutive year of increasing dividends, and we are committed to efforts that will benefit shareholders and other stake holders for years to come.
For 2011, our value creation ratio was 6.0%, but that’s below our target range for the annual average and any five-year period. We are encouraged that our book value per share increased despite a catastrophe loss ratio that was three times higher than the annual average for the prior 10 years. Further, we remain confident that various initiatives to improve profitability and grow premiums will continue to bear fruit, driving stronger value creation over the coming year.
Now, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on results during the quarter and several points regarding our balance sheet.

I’ll start by highlighting important the trends in our property, casualty, underwriting performance. While our full-year 2011-combined ratio of 109.2% was disappointing compared to our history and targets, we see several reasons to be optimistic.
On a calendar year basis, the combined ratio before catastrophes improved by $0.07 of a percentage point. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.
On an accident year basis before catastrophes, the combined ratio for accident year 2011 improved by 2.7 percentage points over accident year 2010 after factoring out the effect of reinstatement premiums.
We remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent. We aim to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range knowing that it is important for long-term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2011 was fairly consistent with 2010 down $0.09 of a point to a ratio of 9.4%.
For favorable reserve development recognized during 2011, 63% was for accident year 2010 inline with 62% for accident year 2009 that was recognized during 2010. For both periods, the balance of favorable development was concentrated in the two next most recent accident years.
Our updated loss and loss expense reserve estimates as of December 31, 2011 show accident years 2010 develop favorably by about six points on a ratio basis, while accident years 2009 and 2008 developed favorably by approximately eight points over the years.
For both 2011 and 2010, our commercial, casualty lines of business was the majority beneficiary of the favorable development. There is no absolute assurance that accident year 2011 will develop in a similar pattern, but we do aim to be consistent in our reserving practices.
During the fourth quarter, we refined our allocation to line of business, segment and accident year for loss expense payments and reserves knowing adjusting other expense or AOE. For the refinement at a zero effect by consolidated property, casualty loss expense reserves in total some lines of business experienced higher incurred loss expenses in some (inaudible). This was a one-time refinement of reserves among the lines of businesses.
The full-year 2011 ratio affect raised on a personal a line segment ratios by approximately three percentage points then lower the commercial line segment ratios by about one point. Some lines of business had larger effects.
Turning to expense management, our insurance operations reflecting focus on improving service and efficiency. The total number of associates and contractors is down 4%, since the end of 2009 and includes a 4% a increase in field associate’s offsets by a 5% decrease in headquarters staff and a 30% decrease in contractors.
Our 2011 property, casualty underwriting expense ratio at 32.2% was 60 basis points lower than last year. We anticipate the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future premium growth and more efficiency in our processes. Investment income is an area where our trend continues to run counter to what the industry is experiencing.
(Inaudible) rose 1% for the year 2011 on a pre-tax basis. A pre-tax yield or above portfolio for year 2011 was 18 basis points lower than the prior year, so interest income continues to face a headwind.
The portfolio had an effective duration of 4.4 years at year-end down from 5.0 years at the end of 2010. Due to an income was the source of our investment income growth during the 2011. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 4% for the fourth quarter and up 5% for the year.
Our equity portfolio also had a nice rebound in valuation during the fourth quarter. The portfolios fair value ended the quarter up 13% reversing the 12% decline during the third quarter.
Pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio reached nearly $1.5 billion at the end of 2011, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Our investment approach remains consistent and we think the long-term capital appreciation potential is important.
Our capital remains strong and we ended the year with over $1 billion and holding company cash and marketable securities. We are well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.
I’ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property, casualty-underwriting profit increased book value by $0.39. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.41.
Shareholders equity changes related to our pension fund, lower book value per share by $0.11, primarily due to the low interest rate environment. It changed an unrealized gain at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.07. so change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value by $1.22, and we paid $40 and $0.25 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net affect was a book value increase of $1.62 during the fourth quarter to $31.16 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 6.8%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.

So it’s in process right now, it’s going we think very well. one indicator that we’d like to see is that there was a question earlier about whether or not we can grow to these levels profitably, writing new business, the new business that it will be required.

So in all areas both renewal and in new business, we’re seeing a tremendous benefit from the model, it will continue to be refined, will come out with the next generation of our Workers’ comp model.

And as we look at the way it was being allocated and we talk to our claims people in terms of where they were actually spending the time. It was indicating that we needed to refine how we allocated the all other expense. And so our actuaries came up with the methodology that lead a little bit more in claim counts also in terms of interviewing the claims people.

It’s a pleasure to speak with you today from [indiscernible] Tennessee, where we will meet with agents this afternoon. This is the fourth state among 22 in total that we are visiting during the first and second quarters. Our agents with th",1008,"Good morning. It’s a pleasure to speak with you today from [indiscernible] Tennessee, where we will meet with agents this afternoon. This is the fourth state among 22 in total that we are visiting during the first and second quarters. Our agents with their optimism, their commitment to our partnership and shared goals really energize us. After three state quarters of heavy catastrophe losses, the fourth quarter was profitable, with commercial line, personal line, excess of surplus lines, life insurance and investments all contributing to strong operating earnings. Essentially, all our indicators of longer-term performance are moving in the right direction and that bodes well for creating shareholder value.
Various strategic initiatives are having a positive effect and I’ll highlight several key areas.
As we discussed during our last quarterly conference call, better insurance pricings is a top priority. We are experiencing improvement through a combination of our diligence, plus somewhat more favorable conditions in several markets. Our pricing precision for each policy continues to improve as we gain more experience with our pricing models.
More thinly price risks are getting significantly higher prices. Fourth quarter increases in renewal pricing occurred for each property casualty segment and also, for each major line of business within segments.
As we pre-announced, commercial lines renewal pricing accelerated during the quarter with average increases in the low to mid-single digit range. Just over 80% of our commercial lines renewed at flat or higher prices. For our excess of surplus line segment, renewal prices continue to increase and are solidly in the mid-single digit range.
Pricing changes for that segment have been positive for the last 16 consecutive months. For personal lines, we believe our 10% increase in 2011 renewal premiums is roughly half from higher rates and half from higher policy accounts. Policy retention has remain fairly steady over the past 2 years with fourth quarter retention in the high upper 80% range for commercialized policies, and then our low to mid 90% range for personalized policies. Our agents are able to sell the value of our products and services. They continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed.
The market remains competitive, particularly for new business, while agencies appointed since the beginning of 2010, drove our 6% new business premium increase for 2011. New business written premiums for agents appointed prior to 2010 decreased approximately 2%.
We are seeing plenty of opportunities to grow profitably and are comfortable declining new business opportunities we believe are underpriced. We also continue to gain confidence that our pricing analytics are helping us to distinguish the more attractive new business offerings from the less attractive ones.
In 2011, we appointed 133 new agencies in areas we consider unreserved about a dozen more than we planned at the beginning of the year. During 2012, we planned to appoint around 130 agencies. It takes several years for our new agency to develop the double-digit market share we enjoyed with agencies appointed for 10 years or longer. The accelerated pace of appointments in recent years, plus our commitment to serving all our agencies and our clients put us on a path where we believe we can achieve $5 billion of direct written premium by 2015.
Above all, our emphasis on premium growth is to do so profitably, in order to raise the level of earnings and book value over the long-term.
Our life insurance business also grew in 2011 with earned premiums up 4%; term life, the largest product line rose 9%. Although, life insurance profits remain challenged by the low interest rate environment, our agencies value the ability to offer quality like products and services to their commercial and personal insurance clients.
The year 2011 will be remembered by many for its violent weather and other natural catastrophes. From a financial perspective, our unprecedented catastrophe losses in 2011 were an earnings event rather than a capital event, as we ended the year with higher shareholders equity than at the start of the year.
An important risk management element for keeping our capital strong is an effective reinsurance program, and we have renewed all our primary reinsurance treaties for 2012. For our [indiscernible] treaties property rates were up approximately 10% and casualty rates were down around 5%.
We chose to add $100 million more to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage, rating it to $600 million per event and we now retain the first $75 million of loss. For our $500 million event, our net retention is $115 million compared with the $88 million in 2011 and $104 million in 2010.
Assuming stable levels of facultative reinsurance, we estimate that our total 2012 premiums [indiscernible] to reinsurers will be approximately $181 million down roughly 16% from 2011 and up about 8% from 2010.
Another important aspect of 2011 high-level catastrophe activity was that it allowed us to showcase our expertise in providing claims service. I can thoroughly stand up about how well our claims staff performed and about how our claims response and other elements of our service play an integral role in our ability to profitably grow the company.
We aim to give policyholders consistent value and service through all these storms and we believe shareholders deserve consistency too. The payment of our dividend to shareholders last October marked our 51st consecutive year of increasing dividends, and we are committed to efforts that will benefit shareholders and other stake holders for years to come.
For 2011, our value creation ratio was 6.0%, but that’s below our target range for the annual average and any 5-year period. We are encouraged that our book value per share increased despite a catastrophe loss ratio that was three times higher than the annual average for the prior 10 years. Further, we remain confident that various initiatives to improve profitability and grow premiums will continue to bear fruit, driving stronger value creation over the coming year.
Now, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on results during the quarter and several points regarding our balance sheet."
260681,145552112,264331,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. And thanks all of you for joining us today. I’ll start by highlighting important trends in our property, casualty, underwriting performance. While our full-year 2011-combined ratio of 109.2% was disappointing compared to our history an",889,"Thank you, Steve. And thanks all of you for joining us today. I’ll start by highlighting important trends in our property, casualty, underwriting performance. While our full-year 2011-combined ratio of 109.2% was disappointing compared to our history and targets, we see several reasons to be optimistic.
On a calendar year basis, the combined ratio before catastrophes improved by $0.07 of a percentage point. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.
On an accident year basis before catastrophes, the combined ratio for accident year 2011 improved by 2.7 percentage points over accident year 2010 after factoring out the effect of reinstatement premiums.
We remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent. We aim to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range knowing that it is important for long-term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2011 was fairly consistent with 2010 down $0.09 of a point to a ratio of 9.4%.
For favorable reserve development recognized during 2011, 63% was for accident year 2010 in line with 62% for accident year 2009 that was recognized during 2010. For both periods, the balance of favorable development was concentrated in the 2 next most recent accident years.
Our updated loss and loss expense reserve estimates as of December 31, 2011 show accident year 2010 develop favorably by about 6 points on a ratio basis, while accident years 2009 and 2008 developed favorably by approximately 8 points over the years.
For both 2011 and 2010, our commercial, casualty lines of business was the majority beneficiary of the favorable development. There is no absolute assurance that accident year 2011 will develop in a similar pattern, but we do aim to be consistent in our reserving practices.
During the fourth quarter, we refined our allocation to line of business, segment and accident year for loss expense payments and reserves knowing adjusting other expense or AOE. For the refinement had a 0 effect by consolidated property, casualty loss expense reserves in total some lines of business experienced higher incurred loss expenses in some lower. This was a 1x refinement of reserves among the lines of businesses.
The full-year 2011 ratio affect raised on a personal a line segment ratios by approximately 3 percentage points then lower the commercial line segment ratios by about 1 point. Some lines of business had larger effects.
Turning to expense management. Our insurance operations reflecting focus on improving service and efficiency. The total number of associates and contractors is down 4%, since the end of 2009 and includes a 4% increase in field associate’s offsets by a 5% decrease in headquarters staff and a 30% decrease in contractors.
Our 2011 property, casualty underwriting expense ratio at 32.2% was 60 basis points lower than last year. We anticipate the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future premium growth and more efficiency in our processes. Investment income is an area where we trend -- our trend continues to run counter to what the industry is experiencing.
[indiscernible] rose 1% for the year 2011 on a pre-tax basis. A pre-tax yield or above portfolio for year 2011 was 18 basis points lower than the prior year, so interest income continues to face a headwind.
The portfolio had an effective duration of 4.4 years at year-end down from 5.0 years at the end of 2010. Due to an income was the source of our investment income growth during the 2011. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 4% for the fourth quarter and up 5% for the year.
Our equity portfolio also had a nice rebound in valuation during the fourth quarter. The portfolios fair value ended the quarter up 13% reversing the 12% decline during the third quarter.
Pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio reached nearly $1.5 billion at the end of 2011, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Our investment approach remains consistent and we think the long-term capital appreciation potential is important.
Our capital remains strong and we ended the year with over $1 billion and holding company cash and marketable securities. We are well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.
I’ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property, casualty-underwriting profit increased book value by $0.39. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.41.
Shareholders equity changes related to our pension fund, lower book value per share by $0.11, primarily due to the low interest rate environment. It changed an unrealized gain at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.07. So change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value by $1.22, and we paid $40 and $0.25 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net affect was a book value increase of $1.62 during the fourth quarter to $31.16 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 6.8%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And Paul is unlike when you think about the effective tax rate, when we take our pretax GAAP book income, 35% with that being a little bit lower this year than the prior year, which was about $500 million versus $176 million this year.

It’s a pleasure to speak with you today from [indiscernible] Tennessee, where we will meet with agents this afternoon. This is the fourth state among 22 in total that we are visiting during the first and second quarters. Our agents with their optimism, their commitment to our partnership and shared goals really energize us. After three state quarters of heavy catastrophe losses, the fourth quarter was profitable, with commercial line, personal line, excess of surplus lines, life insurance and investments all contributing to strong operating earnings. Essentially, all our indicators of longer-term performance are moving in the right direction and that bodes well for creating shareholder value.
Various strategic initiatives are having a positive effect and I’ll highlight several key areas.
As we discussed during our last quarterly conference call, better insurance pricings is a top priority. We are experiencing improvement through a combination of our diligence, plus somewhat more favorable conditions in several markets. Our pricing precision for each policy continues to improve as we gain more experience with our pricing models.
More thinly price risks are getting significantly higher prices. Fourth quarter increases in renewal pricing occurred for each property casualty segment and also, for each major line of business within segments.
As we pre-announced, commercial lines renewal pricing accelerated during the quarter with average increases in the low to mid-single digit range. Just over 80% of our commercial lines renewed at flat or higher prices. For our excess of surplus line segment, renewal prices continue to increase and are solidly in the mid-single digit range.
Pricing changes for that segment have been positive for the last 16 consecutive months. For personal lines, we believe our 10% increase in 2011 renewal premiums is roughly half from higher rates and half from higher policy accounts. Policy retention has remain fairly steady over the past 2 years with fourth quarter retention in the high upper 80% range for commercialized policies, and then our low to mid 90% range for personalized policies. Our agents are able to sell the value of our products and services. They continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed.
The market remains competitive, particularly for new business, while agencies appointed since the beginning of 2010, drove our 6% new business premium increase for 2011. New business written premiums for agents appointed prior to 2010 decreased approximately 2%.
We are seeing plenty of opportunities to grow profitably and are comfortable declining new business opportunities we believe are underpriced. We also continue to gain confidence that our pricing analytics are helping us to distinguish the more attractive new business offerings from the less attractive ones.
In 2011, we appointed 133 new agencies in areas we consider unreserved about a dozen more than we planned at the beginning of the year. During 2012, we planned to appoint around 130 agencies. It takes several years for our new agency to develop the double-digit market share we enjoyed with agencies appointed for 10 years or longer. The accelerated pace of appointments in recent years, plus our commitment to serving all our agencies and our clients put us on a path where we believe we can achieve $5 billion of direct written premium by 2015.
Above all, our emphasis on premium growth is to do so profitably, in order to raise the level of earnings and book value over the long-term.
Our life insurance business also grew in 2011 with earned premiums up 4%; term life, the largest product line rose 9%. Although, life insurance profits remain challenged by the low interest rate environment, our agencies value the ability to offer quality like products and services to their commercial and personal insurance clients.
The year 2011 will be remembered by many for its violent weather and other natural catastrophes. From a financial perspective, our unprecedented catastrophe losses in 2011 were an earnings event rather than a capital event, as we ended the year with higher shareholders equity than at the start of the year.
An important risk management element for keeping our capital strong is an effective reinsurance program, and we have renewed all our primary reinsurance treaties for 2012. For our [indiscernible] treaties property rates were up approximately 10% and casualty rates were down around 5%.
We chose to add $100 million more to our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage, rating it to $600 million per event and we now retain the first $75 million of loss. For our $500 million event, our net retention is $115 million compared with the $88 million in 2011 and $104 million in 2010.
Assuming stable levels of facultative reinsurance, we estimate that our total 2012 premiums [indiscernible] to reinsurers will be approximately $181 million down roughly 16% from 2011 and up about 8% from 2010.
Another important aspect of 2011 high-level catastrophe activity was that it allowed us to showcase our expertise in providing claims service. I can thoroughly stand up about how well our claims staff performed and about how our claims response and other elements of our service play an integral role in our ability to profitably grow the company.
We aim to give policyholders consistent value and service through all these storms and we believe shareholders deserve consistency too. The payment of our dividend to shareholders last October marked our 51st consecutive year of increasing dividends, and we are committed to efforts that will benefit shareholders and other stake holders for years to come.
For 2011, our value creation ratio was 6.0%, but that’s below our target range for the annual average and any 5-year period. We are encouraged that our book value per share increased despite a catastrophe loss ratio that was three times higher than the annual average for the prior 10 years. Further, we remain confident that various initiatives to improve profitability and grow premiums will continue to bear fruit, driving stronger value creation over the coming year.
Now, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on results during the quarter and several points regarding our balance sheet."
260681,145552112,270037,"Cincinnati Financial Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. And thanks all of you for joining us today. I’ll start by highlighting important trends in our property, casualty, underwriting performance. While our full-year 2011-combined ratio of 109.2% was disappointing compared to our history an",889,"Thank you, Steve. And thanks all of you for joining us today. I’ll start by highlighting important trends in our property, casualty, underwriting performance. While our full-year 2011-combined ratio of 109.2% was disappointing compared to our history and targets, we see several reasons to be optimistic.
On a calendar year basis, the combined ratio before catastrophes improved by $0.07 of a percentage point. Factor out the effect of additional 2011 ceded premiums from reinstating our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty and that improvement was 2.0 percentage points.
On an accident year basis before catastrophes, the combined ratio for accident year 2011 improved by 2.7 percentage points over accident year 2010 after factoring out the effect of reinstatement premiums.
We remain confident about the strength of our loss reserves and development patterns. Our approach is consistent. We aim to remain solidly in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range knowing that it is important for long-term financial performance. Reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2011 was fairly consistent with 2010 down $0.09 of a point to a ratio of 9.4%.
For favorable reserve development recognized during 2011, 63% was for accident year 2010 in line with 62% for accident year 2009 that was recognized during 2010. For both periods, the balance of favorable development was concentrated in the 2 next most recent accident years.
Our updated loss and loss expense reserve estimates as of December 31, 2011 show accident year 2010 develop favorably by about 6 points on a ratio basis, while accident years 2009 and 2008 developed favorably by approximately 8 points over the years.
For both 2011 and 2010, our commercial, casualty lines of business was the majority beneficiary of the favorable development. There is no absolute assurance that accident year 2011 will develop in a similar pattern, but we do aim to be consistent in our reserving practices.
During the fourth quarter, we refined our allocation to line of business, segment and accident year for loss expense payments and reserves knowing adjusting other expense or AOE. For the refinement had a 0 effect by consolidated property, casualty loss expense reserves in total some lines of business experienced higher incurred loss expenses in some lower. This was a 1x refinement of reserves among the lines of businesses.
The full-year 2011 ratio affect raised on a personal a line segment ratios by approximately 3 percentage points then lower the commercial line segment ratios by about 1 point. Some lines of business had larger effects.
Turning to expense management. Our insurance operations reflecting focus on improving service and efficiency. The total number of associates and contractors is down 4%, since the end of 2009 and includes a 4% increase in field associate’s offsets by a 5% decrease in headquarters staff and a 30% decrease in contractors.
Our 2011 property, casualty underwriting expense ratio at 32.2% was 60 basis points lower than last year. We anticipate the expense ratio continuing to benefit from future premium growth and more efficiency in our processes. Investment income is an area where we trend -- our trend continues to run counter to what the industry is experiencing.
[indiscernible] rose 1% for the year 2011 on a pre-tax basis. A pre-tax yield or above portfolio for year 2011 was 18 basis points lower than the prior year, so interest income continues to face a headwind.
The portfolio had an effective duration of 4.4 years at year-end down from 5.0 years at the end of 2010. Due to an income was the source of our investment income growth during the 2011. Dividends from our equity portfolio were up 4% for the fourth quarter and up 5% for the year.
Our equity portfolio also had a nice rebound in valuation during the fourth quarter. The portfolios fair value ended the quarter up 13% reversing the 12% decline during the third quarter.
Pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio reached nearly $1.5 billion at the end of 2011, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Our investment approach remains consistent and we think the long-term capital appreciation potential is important.
Our capital remains strong and we ended the year with over $1 billion and holding company cash and marketable securities. We are well positioned for capital management purposes and for growing our insurance business.
I’ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property, casualty-underwriting profit increased book value by $0.39. Life insurance operations added $0.04. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.41.
Shareholders equity changes related to our pension fund, lower book value per share by $0.11, primarily due to the low interest rate environment. It changed an unrealized gain at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.07. So change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized capital gains and losses increased book value by $1.22, and we paid $40 and $0.25 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net affect was a book value increase of $1.62 during the fourth quarter to $31.16 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 6.8%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And so in addition to agencies being particularly careful with us, when they’ve first put business with us after recent employment. We have the benefit as a model helping us in that particular area.

The big run-up in equities last few months really largely just offset the decline in the third quarter of last year. In our type of stocks, the high quality dividend growers generally underperform certainly in 2009. It’s a lesser degree in 2010. So, we think there is little more room to run. We like as Steve mentioned earlier, the allocation equities and what -- and the type of stock you buy, not just for the long-term growth potentials at the income vehicles, low interest rate environment had we not had the allocation we have 2 types of stocks we buy.

We posted a strong first quarter with nice premium growth, and most importantly, we grew profitably. Investment performance was also strong and we more than covered our dividend with operating earnings, allowing us to grow book value. Previously announced catastrophe losses at 11.1 loss ratio points were more than three times higher than our long-term average for the first quarter, and yet we produced an underwriting profit with a 99.1% combined ratio.
We continue to earn higher pricing and healthy level of premium growth in all of our property casualty segments. In our Life Insurance segments, earned premiums rose at a double-digit pace during the first quarter. Our ability to deliver more precise pricing through analytics and our strong underwriting combined with more favorable market conditions also continue to give us confidence that our premium growth meets our criteria for profitability.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing was a notch above what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with an overall average increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. Workers compensation led the way with just over a 10% increase in our smaller commercial property policies that renewed during the first quarter were in the high single-digit range.
For our Excess and Surplus line segment, renewal prices increased for the 19th consecutive month and were up in the high single-digit range for the first quarter. Our Personal Lines business is also benefiting from rate increases over successive years and renewal premiums rose 12% in the first quarter. Policy retention continues to remain steady for each of our property casualty segments and new businesses continuing is contributing to premium growth.
New business premiums rose 6% with the more newly appointed agencies driving that growth. Our goal for new agency appointments during 2012 is 130 and we appointed 56 new agencies in the first quarter. That puts us at over 40% of the full year target. We've been out visiting with agents at our annual sales meetings. So far we have met with agencies from 25 states and in May, we'll have meetings with the agents in the balance of our states. It is encouraging to see how skilled our agents are at conveying the value of our products and services and they continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed. Our pricing analytics are helpful in distinguishing the more attractive new business opportunities from the less attractive ones giving us a good sense of when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced.
Loss experience that was favorable in many respects, added to the benefits we are seeing from better pricing. Paid losses other than catastrophes were down 1.3%, a good sign given that earned premiums were up 7.1%. Our catastrophe losses were limited to specific areas and most of our operating territory benefited from milder than usual weather.
Fewer new large losses, which we define as $250,000 or more per claim, were largely responsible for improvement in current accident year results. While we realized that large losses naturally fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we are encouraged by overall paid loss trends, which were a big reason that we experienced favorable reserve development on older accident years. Mike will discuss that more in a moment.
The first quarter provided a good start toward reaching our annual value creation ratio target of 12% to 15% with a 4.6% contribution for the first three months. While we can't expect every quarter to include so much lift from a higher investment portfolio valuation, we like our investment strategy for the long-term and we'll stay focused on what we can control such as careful underwriting, adequate pricing and excellent claim service. Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on financial items including investment results and reserves.

Let's begin with investment results. Investment income remained steady, largely reflecting a 2% increase in the cost basis of our bond portfolio that offset a slight decline in average yield. The pre-tax yield for our bond portfolio for the first quarter of 2012 was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. The bond portfolio effective duration remained at the year-end level of 4.4 years. Both our equity and fixed maturity portfolios experience significant valuation gains during the first quarter and pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio rose 15% to over 1.7 billion. Our investment approach remains consistent balancing current investment income with long-term capital appreciation potential.
Our approach to loss reserving likewise remains consistent and we believe the adequacy of our reserves is as good as ever. Net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was 6.6 percentage points higher in the first quarter 2012 with nearly 40% of that favorable development coming from reserves for catastrophe losses. The first quarter 2012 ratio for favorable reserve development other than catastrophes was 26% higher than the full year 2011 ratio. The net favorable development of $116 million was broad based, spread over several accident years including 24% for accident year 2011, 32% for accident year 2010, 14% for accident year 2009, and 30% for all older accident years. Every line of business contributed to the favorable development, except for surety and executive risk line.
Moving onto expenses management, I'll simply say that we continue to carefully manage expenses as demonstrated by the first quarter property casualty underwriting expense. Before agency commissions on profitable business and wage increases for good performance, both of which we're pleased to pay, other underwriting expenses were essentially flat compared with a year ago. I'll briefly touch on the effects of our adoption of the new accounting standard for deferred policy acquisition cost known as DAC, which we applied retrospectively.
Adoption resulted in adjusting first quarter 2011 net income by lowering it by $1 million. Our year end 2011 DAC for our property casualty and life segments originally reported on the balance sheet was reduced by $33 million or 6% and the book value per share was reduced by $0.13 which is only 0.4%. Net cash flow from operations was strong at $148 million, up from $91 million in the first quarter of last year, and our highest first quarter level since 2008. We had our best first quarter in terms of net income since 2007. Our capital remained solid supporting growth in our insurance segments and we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in holding company cash and marketable securities.
I’ll conclude my prepared comments as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting profit increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.75 and we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to our shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.4 during the first quarter at $32.07 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 4.6%.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Steve.

So, we think we are getting the rate when we need it but we also think we are conveying the value that we bring as a company in terms of our service, our products, our field representation and it's allowing us, I think, to benefit from maintaining pretty good retention. As we look at it, retention is a bit lower on the risk that we would like to not be on. So, I guess, also if we look at the three-year policies, the retention there is quite high when they come off of their three year policy, we've got quite a bit of loyalty there.

What we’re seeing in our book of business, and I think by and large in the industry, they have been fairly modest rate increases that are coming across for policyholders. So, having experienced a 3 to 4% increase, I'll pick that number out of the air, for a policyholder and then next year, something probably more than that, has been more palatable. What we’re seeing in our commercial book is that the economy is starting to show some signs of improvement. Payrolls and sales are going up, agents are conditioned and more prepared to deliver increases as long as they are not really significant. 
And so, I would not anticipate. In fact, I think we're going into the rest of this year, next year knowing that rates will or at least based on what we’re seeing, that rates will continue to go up. We’re confident that we’ll be able to place those. We take a look at every renewal policy by policy and make certain that we’re as surgically as you can be, surgical about the approach that we take.

We posted a strong first quarter with nice premium growth, and most importantly, we grew profitably. Investment performance was also strong and we more than covered our dividend with operating earnings, allowing us to grow book value. Previously announced catastrophe losses at 11.1 loss ratio points were more than three times higher than our long-term average for a first quarter, and yet we produced an underwriting profit with a 99.1% combined ratio.
We continue to earn higher pricing and healthy level of premium growth in all of our property casualty segments. In our Life Insurance segments, earned premiums rose at a double-digit pace during the first quarter. Our ability to deliver more precise pricing through analytics and our strong underwriting combined with more favorable market conditions also continue to give us confidence that our premium growth meets our criteria for profitability.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing was a notch above what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with an overall average increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. Workers compensation led the way with just over a 10% increase in our smaller commercial property policies that renewed during the first quarter were in the high single-digit range.
For our Excess and Surplus line segment, renewal prices increased for the 19th consecutive month and were up in the high single-digit range for the first quarter. Our Personal Lines business is also benefiting from rate increases over successive years and renewal premiums rose 12% in the first quarter. Policy retention continues to remain steady for each of our property casualty segments and new businesses continuing-- is contributing to premium growth.
New business premiums rose 6% with the more newly appointed agencies driving that growth. Our goal for new agency appointments during 2012 is 130 and we appointed 56 new agencies in the first quarter. That puts us at over 40% of the full year target. We've been out visiting with agents at our annual sales meetings. So far we have met with agencies from 25 states and in May, we'll have meetings with the agents in the balance of our states. It is encouraging to see how skilled our agents are at conveying the value of our products and services and they continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed. Our pricing analytics are helpful in distinguishing the more attractive new business opportunities from the less attractive ones giving us a good sense of when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced.
Loss experience that was favorable in many respects, added to the benefits we are seeing from better pricing. Paid losses other than catastrophes were down 1.3%, a good sign given that earned premiums were up 7.1%. Our catastrophe losses were limited to specific areas and most of our operating territory benefited from milder than usual weather.
Fewer new large losses, which we define as $250,000 or more per claim, were largely responsible for improvement in current accident year results. While we realized that large losses naturally fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we are encouraged by overall paid loss trends, which were a big reason that we experienced favorable reserve development on older accident years. Mike will discuss that more in a moment.
The first quarter provided a good start toward reaching our annual value creation ratio target of 12% to 15% with a 4.6% contribution for the first three months. While we can't expect every quarter to include so much lift from a higher investment portfolio valuation, we like our investment strategy for the long-term and we'll stay focused on what we can control such as careful underwriting, adequate pricing and excellent claim service. Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on financial items including investment results and reserves."

Let's begin with investment results. Investment income remained steady, largely reflecting a 2% increase in the cost basis of our bond portfolio that offset a slight decline in average yield.",600,"Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's begin with investment results. Investment income remained steady, largely reflecting a 2% increase in the cost basis of our bond portfolio that offset a slight decline in average yield. The pre-tax yield for our bond portfolio for the first quarter of 2012 was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. The bond portfolio effective duration remained at the year-end level of 4.4 years. Both our equity and fixed maturity portfolios experienced significant valuation gains during the first quarter and pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio rose 15% to over 1.7 billion. Our investment approach remains consistent balancing current investment income with long-term capital appreciation potential.
Our approach to loss reserving likewise remains consistent and we believe the adequacy of our reserves is as good as ever. Net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was 6.6% percentage points higher in the first quarter 2012 with nearly 40% of that favorable development coming from reserves for catastrophe losses. The first quarter 2012 ratio for favorable reserve development other than catastrophes was 26% higher than the full year 2011 ratio. The net favorable development of $116 million was broad based, spread over several accident years including 24% for accident year 2011, 32% for accident year 2010, 14% for accident year 2009, and 30% for all older accident years. Every line of business contributed to the favorable development, except for surety and executive risk line.
Moving onto expense management, I'll simply say that we continue to carefully manage expenses as demonstrated by the first quarter property casualty underwriting expenses. Before agency commissions on profitable business and wage increases for good performance, both of which we're pleased to pay, other underwriting expenses were essentially flat compared with a year ago. I'll briefly touch on the effects of our adoption of the new accounting standard for deferred policy acquisition cost known as DAC, which we applied retrospectively.
Adoption resulted in adjusting first quarter 2011 net income by lowering it by $1 million. Our year end 2011 DAC for our property casualty and life segments originally reported on the balance sheet was reduced by $33 million or 6% and a book value per share was reduced by $0.13 which is only 0.4%. Net cash flow from operations was strong at $148 million, up from $91 million in the first quarter of last year, and our highest first quarter level since 2008. We had our best first quarter in terms of net income since 2007. Our capital remained solid supporting growth in our insurance segments and we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in holding company cash and marketable securities.
I’ll conclude my prepared comments as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting profit increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.75 and we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to our shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.40 during the first quarter at $32.07 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 4.6%.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Steve."

What we’re seeing in our book of business, and I think by and large in the industry, they have been fairly modest rate increases that are coming across for policyholders. So, having experienced a 3% to 4% increase, I'll pick that number out of the air, for a policyholder and then next year, something probably more than that, has been more palatable. What we’re seeing in our commercial book is that the economy is starting to show some signs of improvement. Payrolls and sales are going up, agents are conditioned and more prepared to deliver increases as long as they are not really significant.
And so, I would not anticipate. In fact, I think we're going into the rest of this year, next year knowing that rates will or at least based on what we’re seeing, that rates will continue to go up.

We posted a strong first quarter with nice premium growth, and most importantly, we grew profitably. Investment performance was also strong and we more than covered our dividend with operating earnings, allowing us to grow book value. Previously announced catastrophe losses at 11.1 loss ratio points were more than three times higher than our long-term average for a first quarter, and yet we produced an underwriting profit with a 99.1% combined ratio.
We continue to earn higher pricing and healthy level of premium growth in all of our property casualty segments. In our Life Insurance segments, earned premiums rose at a double-digit pace during the first quarter. Our ability to deliver more precise pricing through analytics and our strong underwriting combined with more favorable market conditions also continue to give us confidence that our premium growth meets our criteria for profitability.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing was a notch above what we experienced in the fourth quarter, with an overall average increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. Workers compensation led the way with just over a 10% increase in our smaller commercial property policies that renewed during the first quarter were in the high single-digit range.
For our Excess and Surplus line segment, renewal prices increased for the 19th consecutive month and were up in the high single-digit range for the first quarter. Our Personal Lines business is also benefiting from rate increases over successive years and renewal premiums rose 12% in the first quarter. Policy retention continues to remain steady for each of our property casualty segments and new businesses continuing-- is contributing to premium growth.
New business premiums rose 6% with the more newly appointed agencies driving that growth. Our goal for new agency appointments during 2012 is 130 and we appointed 56 new agencies in the first quarter. That puts us at over 40% of the full year target. We've been out visiting with agents at our annual sales meetings. So far we have met with agencies from 25 states and in May, we'll have meetings with the agents in the balance of our states. It is encouraging to see how skilled our agents are at conveying the value of our products and services and they continue to work with us to implement price increases where they are needed. Our pricing analytics are helpful in distinguishing the more attractive new business opportunities from the less attractive ones giving us a good sense of when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced.
Loss experience that was favorable in many respects, added to the benefits we are seeing from better pricing. Paid losses other than catastrophes were down 1.3%, a good sign given that earned premiums were up 7.1%. Our catastrophe losses were limited to specific areas and most of our operating territory benefited from milder than usual weather.
Fewer new large losses, which we define as $250,000 or more per claim, were largely responsible for improvement in current accident year results. While we realized that large losses naturally fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we are encouraged by overall paid loss trends, which were a big reason that we experienced favorable reserve development on older accident years. Mike will discuss that more in a moment.
The first quarter provided a good start toward reaching our annual value creation ratio target of 12% to 15% with a 4.6% contribution for the first three months. While we can't expect every quarter to include so much lift from a higher investment portfolio valuation, we like our investment strategy for the long-term and we'll stay focused on what we can control such as careful underwriting, adequate pricing and excellent claim service. Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will further comment on financial items including investment results and reserves."

Let's begin with investment results. Investment income remained steady, largely reflecting a 2% increase in the cost basis of our bond portfolio that offset a slight decline in average yield.",600,"Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let's begin with investment results. Investment income remained steady, largely reflecting a 2% increase in the cost basis of our bond portfolio that offset a slight decline in average yield. The pre-tax yield for our bond portfolio for the first quarter of 2012 was 12 basis points lower than a year ago. The bond portfolio effective duration remained at the year-end level of 4.4 years. Both our equity and fixed maturity portfolios experienced significant valuation gains during the first quarter and pre-tax net unrealized gains for the total investment portfolio rose 15% to over 1.7 billion. Our investment approach remains consistent balancing current investment income with long-term capital appreciation potential.
Our approach to loss reserving likewise remains consistent and we believe the adequacy of our reserves is as good as ever. Net favorable reserve development on prior accident years was 6.6% percentage points higher in the first quarter 2012 with nearly 40% of that favorable development coming from reserves for catastrophe losses. The first quarter 2012 ratio for favorable reserve development other than catastrophes was 26% higher than the full year 2011 ratio. The net favorable development of $116 million was broad based, spread over several accident years including 24% for accident year 2011, 32% for accident year 2010, 14% for accident year 2009, and 30% for all older accident years. Every line of business contributed to the favorable development, except for surety and executive risk line.
Moving onto expense management, I'll simply say that we continue to carefully manage expenses as demonstrated by the first quarter property casualty underwriting expenses. Before agency commissions on profitable business and wage increases for good performance, both of which we're pleased to pay, other underwriting expenses were essentially flat compared with a year ago. I'll briefly touch on the effects of our adoption of the new accounting standard for deferred policy acquisition cost known as DAC, which we applied retrospectively.
Adoption resulted in adjusting first quarter 2011 net income by lowering it by $1 million. Our year end 2011 DAC for our property casualty and life segments originally reported on the balance sheet was reduced by $33 million or 6% and a book value per share was reduced by $0.13 which is only 0.4%. Net cash flow from operations was strong at $148 million, up from $91 million in the first quarter of last year, and our highest first quarter level since 2008. We had our best first quarter in terms of net income since 2007. Our capital remained solid supporting growth in our insurance segments and we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in holding company cash and marketable securities.
I’ll conclude my prepared comments as usual by summarizing the contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting profit increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items, contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.75 and we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to our shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.40 during the first quarter at $32.07 per share. Adding the dividend, our value creation ratio for the quarter was 4.6%.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Steve."

We think it's very much on a risk-by-risk basis, and we feel that we are gaining price adequacy, we got rate in the lines that we felt needed it the most with workers comp leading the way with just over 10% increase, the smaller commercial property policies that renew annually, we got real high single digit increases there. So, we think we are getting the rate where we need it but we also think we are conveying the value that we bring as a company in terms of our service, our products, our field representation and it's allowing us, I think, to benefit from maintaining pretty good retention. As we look at it, retention is a bit lower on the risk that we would like to-- not be on. So, I guess, also if we look at the three-year policies, the retention there is quite high when they come off of their three year policy, we've got quite a bit of loyalty there."

Payrolls and sales are going up, agents are conditioned and more prepared to deliver increases as long as they are not really significant.

So what we continue to do is a new appointment strategy is look for centers of influence in the community, agencies that are broad based in what they write, first lines as well as commercial lines, excess and surplus lines, and then go in and do our best to appeal across the board.

My comments on the second quarter parallel several I made at our last earnings call. Investment income remained steady and our investment portfolio continues to grow. Mike will discuss investment details in a few moments.
Underwriting performance before the effects of catastrophes was very much improved compared with the year ago, similar to recent quarters. On the other hand catastrophe losses continued above historical norms for us and for many in our industry.
Previously announced second quarter catastrophe losses added nearly 18 points to our combined ratio. Improved underwriting performance in part reflected pricing for property casualty policies that continue to increase. Overall, pricing was up a bit from the first quarter.
Each of our Property Casualty segments again had healthy levels of net written premium growth. They each grew at a double-digit pace during the second quarter and our Life Insurance segments earned premium rose likewise. Factoring out reinsurance effects property casualty written premiums rose 12%, and were satisfied because more precise and overall higher pricing was a large contributor.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing moved somewhat higher in the second quarter compared with the first. Overall, average increases were in the mid single-digit range, including the blending effect of three year policies. Renewals of workers compensation and smaller commercial property policies again experienced stronger pricing during the second quarter than most of our other lines of business.
Our Excess and Surplus line segment had a higher renewal price for the 22 consecutive month, again in a high single-digit range. And personalized premiums continued to experience rate increases over successive years with renewal premiums up 11% for the second quarter and first half of 2012.
Policy retention for Commercial and Personal Lines continues to remain steady in its contribution to total written premiums. The contribution of new businesses is increasing in significance, reflecting benefits from both higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Property Casualty new business premiums in the second quarter were 12% higher than a year ago. Recently appointed agencies again drove that growth. As of June 30, we have appointed 93 new agencies on pace toward a full-year target of 130.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools help us determine when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced as well as when to have the confidence to compete for good accounts.
We are studying our property book of business and identifying opportunities to improve underwriting results for the property lines. Our approach is similar to the multifaceted effort that has been improving our workers compensation results. We've already put in place some of the pieces and in the future we will further discuss plans and progress.
Over time, we'll also benefit from earning the rate increases we've taken on property coverages. On a written premium basis in recent quarters, those property rate increases have outpaced the increase that's taken on much of our non-property business.
Our total property casualty combined ratio for the first half of 2012 showed good improvement over 2011, on both a current accident year and calendar year basis. That improvement holds up however you analyze it, with or without the effects of catastrophes and the accident reinsurance costs in 2011.
We're continuing to see the benefits of ongoing efforts to improve pricing, underwriting and claims management. We are confident further benefits will manifest in our operating results. At the same time, we remain steadfast in our approach to service excellence, reserve adequacy, investment management and strong capital.
Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on several financial items.

Our investment portfolio continued its steady contribution to earnings in the second quarter. Investment income again matched the prior year's quarter and both major components, interest income and dividends were essentially flat.
Yields for our bond portfolio were slightly lower than last year. As we reported, the second quarter of 2012 was even with the first quarter at 5.2% on a pre-tax basis and 3.8% on an after-tax basis.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration edged down to 4.3 years from 4.4 years. In our common stock portfolio, we're seeing dividend increases over the past year for most of our holdings, but less funds were at work in that portfolio for much of the past 18 months. Its cost basis is just now approaching its yearend 2010 level, following a reduction in the first half of 2011 of almost 8%.
Our fixed maturity portfolio again experienced a valuation gain during the second quarter. For the equity portfolio, unrealized gains were 8% lower at the end of June compared with March. Still, that portfolio is pre-tax net unrealized gains of $891 million or 12% higher than at the end of 2011.
Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2012, continued at a healthy pace. That helps fuel our investment income and offset the effects of the low interest rate environment.
At $265 million, net cash flow already exceeded the full year 2011 by $18 million. It's on pace to exceed the full year 2010 and 2009, each at roughly $530 million since the second half of the year typically has lower catastrophe loss payments and the bulk of the agency profit sharing was already paid in the first quarter.
Moving to balance sheet highlights, a consistent approach to loss reserving is one of our hallmarks. And metrics for reserve development on prior accident years, demonstrate that consistency.
Through the first six months of this year we benefited from 10.8 percentage points of net favorable reserve development before catastrophe losses. That result came within one-half of a point of 2011's six-month development. Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first half, which totaled $201 million, including catastrophe losses.
Our six-month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 19% for accident year 2011, 30% for accident year 2010, 16% for accident year 2009, and 35% for all older accident years. We also continue to maintain our consistently low debt leverage with a debt to total capital ratio of 14.8% at June 30.
As previously reported, we established a new $225 million line of credit in May. It replaced two credit facilities that totaled the same amount. Six banks participate and it's for a term of five years. Most of the major terms and conditions are similar to the former credit facilities, but we gained some flexibility in terms of borrowing capacity such as raising the debt to total capital covenant to 30% from 20%.
In addition to enhancing our already great financial flexibility with a new credit facility, we once again ended the quarter holding over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level. Our capital remained strong and is available to support additional premium growth in our Insurance segments.
I'll conclude my prepared comments as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. Property Casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.31. Life Insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.44.
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.40. And we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to shareholders.
The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.41 during the second quarter to $31.66 per share. That result is 2% above the yearend level contributing to the first half value creation ratio of 4.6%.

We feel we're hitting the rate in the areas that we need rate and we're continuing to be able to get rate. I think it's not just the average rate increases that we're taking, but that we're using a lot of precision looking at risk on an individual basis, comparing what we think the exposure is to what the rate that's needed for that individual policy.

That's been the implementation of the predicted modeling, has been a big contributor to guiding us on the pricing. We'll be introducing our second generation of that model. We in fact are in the process of doing that right now.
But in addition to that, we've done a lot more in loss control, specifically on accounts greater than $50,000. Every single one of those accounts is going through a more rigorous review by our loss control division that are scored, based on the review. That resulted in a lot more insight on the accounts that we write.
I think really, and Marty might want to add to this, Marty Mullen, our Chief Claims Officer. But in the claims area, there's been a tremendous amount of specialization and both in terms of putting loss control specialists in the fields, but bill revising has contributed significantly.
We have call center now where we ask the policyholder to call directly into Cincinnati, which accelerates the lag between when the injury occurs and when we are able to triage the injury, and address how it's going to be handled.
So all of those things have contributed. Pricing continues to be therefore a force in the comp area. That still remains consistent. I think in terms of the contribution that loss control and claims will give us, we think there's still some to be gained there.

If you take our ex-cat net underwriting results for property through year-to-date, we're running at if we were to have average cat, at about 105 combined ratio for commercial property.
It's not horrible, considering the kind of cats that we've had, but it's certainly not satisfactory. So we are expanding geographically, but honestly the population of Idaho and Utah and Oregon, that alone is not enough to balance out the kinds of concentrations, we have more in the Midwest.
So we're trying to spend a lot more time here in the Midwest trying to identify ways in addition to rate and property rates are solidly getting into the upper single-digit ranges, and they're accelerating. 
But we've got a lot going on with deductible increases in property, a lot more discussion in the marketplace about percentage deductibles. There is a tolerance on that though.
In coastal areas, people are used to 2% and 5% win deductibles, in the Midwest they are not, but there's a lot more discussion there. We're taking a lot closer look at habitational risks, apartments, condos, all type of things that have asphalt shingles, very much susceptible to hail types of claims. Those are areas where we're looking at much stronger deductibles.
Less owner risk only property, you may hear a lot of other carriers talk about that, but in addition to rough exposures there, we've spend a lot more time verifying through inspections and loss control, who the tenants are? Whether or not during these tougher economic times, maintenance might have deteriorated.
Claim specialization is part of what we're doing in the property area, as well. And I mentioned loss control but specifically, in terms of inspections we're doing a lot more in that area and adding a lot more in loss control.
So the solution to property filling the Commercial Line side, it's not monumental. We want that combined ratio including tax to be in the 90 range. We think we are that kind of company, but there is a lot other moving parts to trigger it there.

The fact of the matter is that in terms of all the new business we've written in 2012 to date, agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011, the business we've written from those folks has been most price adequate, of all the new business we've written throughout the year.
So we're pleased with the amount of new business we're getting. Frankly, we would expect to write slightly more new business, based on the new agencies that we've appointed and the conversations with agencies we've had. But that is one area where we monitor, very granularly the direction that we've gone in terms of pricing of the new accounts that we've written. So we meet monthly on that. So we're comfortable that, though, a new business is up, it's not at the expense of underwriting profitability.

We understand that, and monitor it. I guess, there will be a variety of reasons. When you appoint a group of agencies or appoint an agency, we make it very clear in the appointment process that we expect to be a meaningful part of the agency.
One way of the agency making that happen, is to consolidate the number of carriers they have in the agency. So we may be given an opportunity to look at business, simply because they want to cut down the number of carriers they have.
Some carriers in the marketplace have announced that they're going to take a very, very tough pricing approach. That they are going to get a minimum rate increase on all of their renewals, translation, agency shops most of that business just to be on guard, so we some business because of that.
The three-year policy is a significant advantage, I guess, or certainly an important thing for an agency, right now. There is an expectation that pricing increases will continue, that the market will continue firm for a while. So therefore, an agency would might want to put the policyholder with us on a three-year guarantee. So all of those things together, give us an opportunity to see very good business in the marketplace.

And that, the way we provide for the cat provision is we used RMS version 11, they are most recent up-to-date model. One that is pretty conservative. But we use the RMS version 11 model.

The model is run at numerous scenarios, thousands of scenarios are generated and we come up with an expected value for catastrophe losses, and that is what we build into our rate level.
So it's not our last 20 years of history or our last 10 or any years of history, it's what does the most recent model show. And so then we're at a point where we're comparing, what actually happens versus what did we built into the models. And I just think as we look at overall, in terms, of where these catastrophes happened versus where our footprint is, it just happened to be more in line with where we were and produced outsize losses vis-à-vis what we're building in, and in terms of expected losses for cats.

Investment income remained steady and our investment portfolio continues to grow. Mike will discuss investment details in a few moments.
Underwriting performance before the effects of catastrophes was very much improved compared with the year ago, similar to recent quarters. On the other hand catastrophe losses continued above historical norms for us and for many in our industry.
Previously announced second quarter catastrophe losses added nearly 18 points to our combined ratio. Improved underwriting performance in part reflected pricing for property casualty policies that continue to increase. Overall, pricing was up a bit from the first quarter.
Each of our Property Casualty segments again had healthy levels of net written premium growth. They each grew at a double-digit pace during the second quarter and our Life Insurance segments earned premium rose likewise. Factoring out reinsurance effects property casualty written premiums rose 12%, and were satisfied because more precise and overall higher pricing was a large contributor.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing moved somewhat higher in the second quarter compared with the first. Overall, average increases were in the mid single-digit range, including the blending effect of three year policies. Renewals of workers compensation and smaller commercial property policies again experienced stronger pricing during the second quarter than most of our other lines of business.
Our Excess and Surplus line segment had a higher renewal price for the 22nd consecutive month, again in a high single-digit range. And personalized premiums continued to experience rate increases over successive years with renewal premiums up 11% for the second quarter and first half of 2012.
Policy retention for Commercial and Personal Lines continues to remain steady in its contribution to total written premiums. The contribution of new businesses is increasing in significance, reflecting benefits from both higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Property Casualty new business premiums in the second quarter were 12% higher than a year ago. Recently appointed agencies again drove that growth. As of June 30, we have appointed 93 new agencies on pace toward a full-year target of 130.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools help us determine when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced as well as when to have the confidence to compete for good accounts.
We are studying our property book of business and identifying opportunities to improve underwriting results for the property lines. Our approach is similar to the multifaceted effort that has been improving our workers compensation results. We've already put in place some of the pieces and in the future we will further discuss plans and progress.
Over time, we'll also benefit from earning the rate increases we've taken on property coverages. On a written premium basis in recent quarters, those property rate increases have outpaced the increases taken on much of our non-property business.
Our total property casualty combined ratio for the first half of 2012 showed good improvement over 2011, on both a current accident year and calendar year basis. That improvement holds up however you analyze it, with or without the effects of catastrophes and the extra reinsurance costs in 2011.
We're continuing to see the benefits of ongoing efforts to improve pricing, underwriting and claims management. We are confident further benefits will manifest in our operating results. At the same time, we remain steadfast in our approach to service excellence, reserve adequacy, investment management and strong capital.
Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on several financial items."

Investment income again matched the prior year's quarter and both major components, interest income and dividends were essentially flat.
Yields for our bond portfolio were slightly lower than last year. As we reported, the second quarter of 2012 was even with the first quarter at 5.2% on a pre-tax basis and 3.8% on an after-tax basis.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration edged down to 4.3 years from 4.4 years. In our common stock portfolio, we're seeing dividend increases over the past year for most of our holdings, but less funds were at work in that portfolio for much of the past 18 months. Its cost basis is just now approaching its yearend 2010 level, following a reduction in the first half of 2011 of almost 8%.
Our fixed maturity portfolio again experienced a valuation gain during the second quarter. For the equity portfolio, unrealized gains were 8% lower at the end of June compared with March. Still, that portfolio is pre-tax net unrealized gains of $891 million or 12% higher than at the end of 2011.
Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2012, continued at a healthy pace. That helps fuel our investment income and offset the effects of the low interest rate environment.
At $265 million, net cash flow already exceeded the full year 2011 by $18 million. It's on pace to exceed the full year 2010 and 2009, each at roughly $530 million since the second half of the year typically has lower catastrophe loss payments and the bulk of the agency profit sharing was already paid in the first quarter.
Moving to balance sheet highlights, a consistent approach to loss reserving is one of our hallmarks. And metrics for reserve development on prior accident years, demonstrate that consistency.
Through the first six months of this year we benefited from 10.8 percentage points of net favorable reserve development before catastrophe losses. That result came within one-half of a point of 2011's six-month development. Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first half, which totaled $201 million, including catastrophe losses.
Our six-month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 19% for accident year 2011, 30% for accident year 2010, 16% for accident year 2009, and 35% for all older accident years. We also continue to maintain our consistently low debt leverage with a debt to total capital ratio of 14.8% at June 30.
As previously reported, we established a new $225 million line of credit in May. It replaced two credit facilities that totaled the same amount. Six banks participate and it's for a term of five years. Most of the major terms and conditions are similar to the former credit facilities, but we gained some flexibility in terms of borrowing capacity such as raising the debt to total capital covenant to 30% from 20%.
In addition to enhancing our already great financial flexibility with a new credit facility, we once again ended the quarter holding over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level. Our capital will remain strong and is available to support additional premium growth in our Insurance segments.
I'll conclude my prepared comments as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. Property Casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.31. Life Insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.44.
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.40. And we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to shareholders.
The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.41 during the second quarter to $31.66 per share. That result is 2% above the yearend level contributing to the first half value creation ratio of 4.6%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

The implementation of the predicted modeling, has been a big contributor to guiding us on the pricing. We'll be introducing our second generation of that model. We in fact are in the process of doing that right now.
But in addition to that, we've done a lot more in loss control, specifically on accounts greater than $50,000. Every single one of those accounts is going through a more rigorous review by our loss control division they're are scored, based on the review. That resulted in a lot more insight on the accounts that we write.
I think really, and Marty might want to add to this, Marty Mullen, our Chief Claims Officer. But in the claims area, there's been a tremendous amount of specialization and both in terms of putting loss control specialists in the fields, but bill repricing has contributed significantly.
We have call center now where we ask the policyholder to call directly into Cincinnati, which accelerates the lag between when the injury occurs and when we are able to triage the injury, and address how it's going to be handled.
So all of those things have contributed. Pricing continues to be therefore a force in the comp area. That still remains consistent. I think in terms of the contribution that loss control and claims will give us, we think there's still some to be gained there."

And that we recognized that we have a concentration issue. For example, our top-six states for homeowners, that the Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Alabama, and Georgia, they represent over two-thirds, about 67.3% of our homeowners' premium.
And those states, we actually saw new business down 4.4%. So the growth in new business that you see in our published financials came outside of the states where we have the geographic concentration.

If you take our ex-cat net underwriting results for property through year-to-date, we're running at if we were to have average cats, at about 105 combined ratio for commercial property.
It's not horrible, considering the kind of cats that we've had, but it's certainly not satisfactory. So we are expanding geographically, but honestly the population of Idaho and Utah and Oregon, that alone is not enough to balance out the kinds of concentrations, we have more in the Midwest.
So we're trying to spend a lot more time here in the Midwest trying to identify ways in addition to rate and property rates are solidly getting into the upper single-digit ranges, and they're accelerating.
But we've got a lot going on with deductible increases in property, a lot more discussion in the marketplace about percentage deductibles. There is a tolerance on that though.
In coastal areas, people are used to 2% and 5% win deductibles, in the Midwest they are not, but there's a lot more discussion there. We're taking a lot closer look at habitational risks, apartments, condos, all type of things that have asphalt shingles, very much susceptible to hail types of claims. Those are areas where we're looking at much stronger deductibles.
Less owner risk only property, you may hear a lot of other carriers talk about that, but in addition to rough exposures there, we've spend a lot more time verifying through inspections and loss control, who the tenants are, whether or not during these tougher economic times, maintenance might have deteriorated.
Claim specialization is part of what we're doing in the property area, as well. And I mentioned loss control but specifically, in terms of inspections we're doing a lot more in that area and adding a lot more in loss control.
So the solution to property filling the Commercial Line side, it's not monumental. We want that combined ratio including tax to be in the 90 range. We think we are that kind of company, but there is a lot other moving parts to trigger it there."

It's a huge contributor to it, but there are lot of other things that you might call non-modeled attributes. So we take that down to the policy levels, and so actually, if you can do that we can take it down to the agency level, to the field territory level, to the state level.
The fact of the matter is that in terms of all the new business we've written in 2012 to date, agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011, the business we've written from those folks has been most price adequate, of all the new business we've written throughout the year.

We understand that, and monitor it. I guess, there will be a variety of reasons. When you appoint a group of agencies or appoint an agency, we make it very clear in the appointment process that we expect to be a meaningful part of the agency.
One way of the agency making that happen, is to consolidate the number of carriers they have in the agency. So we may be given an opportunity to look at business, simply because they want to cut down the number of carriers they have.
Some carriers in the marketplace have announced that they're going to take a very, very tough pricing approach. That they are going to get a minimum rate increase on all of their renewals, translation, agency shops most of that business just to be on guard, so we see some business because of that.
The three-year policy is a significant advantage, I guess, or certainly an important thing for an agency, right now. There is an expectation that pricing increases will continue, that the market will continue firm for a while. So therefore, an agency would might want to put the policyholder with us on a three-year guarantee. So all of those things together, give us an opportunity to see very good business in the marketplace."

And that, the way we provide for the cat provision is we used RMS version 11, they are most recent up-to-date model. One that is pretty conservative. But we use the RMS version 11 model.
We then put in at a very granular level, right down to the street address, our current exposures. What is the coverage A and all the characteristics of the houses that we write, so that we have both a current model and a current picture of our exposures.
The model is run at numerous scenarios, thousands of scenarios are generated and we come up with an expected value for catastrophe losses, and that is what we build into our rate level.
So it's not our last 20 years of history or our last 10 or any years of history, it's what does the most recent model show. And so then we're at a point where we're comparing, what actually happens versus what did we built into the models.

Investment income remained steady and our investment portfolio continues to grow. Mike will discuss investment details in a few moments.
Underwriting performance before the effects of catastrophes was very much improved compared with the year ago, similar to recent quarters. On the other hand catastrophe losses continued above historical norms for us and for many in our industry.
Previously announced second quarter catastrophe losses added nearly 18 points to our combined ratio. Improved underwriting performance in part reflected pricing for property casualty policies that continue to increase. Overall, pricing was up a bit from the first quarter.
Each of our Property Casualty segments again had healthy levels of net written premium growth. They each grew at a double-digit pace during the second quarter and our Life Insurance segments earned premium rose likewise. Factoring out reinsurance effects property casualty written premiums rose 12%, and were satisfied because more precise and overall higher pricing was a large contributor.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing moved somewhat higher in the second quarter compared with the first. Overall, average increases were in the mid single-digit range, including the blending effect of three year policies. Renewals of workers compensation and smaller commercial property policies again experienced stronger pricing during the second quarter than most of our other lines of business.
Our Excess and Surplus line segment had a higher renewal price for the 22nd consecutive month, again in a high single-digit range. And personalized premiums continued to experience rate increases over successive years with renewal premiums up 11% for the second quarter and first half of 2012.
Policy retention for Commercial and Personal Lines continues to remain steady in its contribution to total written premiums. The contribution of new businesses is increasing in significance, reflecting benefits from both higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Property Casualty new business premiums in the second quarter were 12% higher than a year ago. Recently appointed agencies again drove that growth. As of June 30, we have appointed 93 new agencies on pace toward a full-year target of 130.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools help us determine when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced as well as when to have the confidence to compete for good accounts.
We are studying our property book of business and identifying opportunities to improve underwriting results for the property lines. Our approach is similar to the multifaceted effort that has been improving our workers compensation results. We've already put in place some of the pieces and in the future we will further discuss plans and progress.
Over time, we'll also benefit from earning the rate increases we've taken on property coverages. On a written premium basis in recent quarters, those property rate increases have outpaced the increases taken on much of our non-property business.
Our total property casualty combined ratio for the first half of 2012 showed good improvement over 2011, on both a current accident year and calendar year basis. That improvement holds up however you analyze it, with or without the effects of catastrophes and the extra reinsurance costs in 2011.
We're continuing to see the benefits of ongoing efforts to improve pricing, underwriting and claims management. We are confident further benefits will manifest in our operating results. At the same time, we remain steadfast in our approach to service excellence, reserve adequacy, investment management and strong capital.
Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on several financial items."

Investment income again matched the prior year's quarter and both major components, interest income and dividends were essentially flat.Yields for our bond por",696,"Our investment portfolio continued its steady contribution to earnings in the second quarter. Investment income again matched the prior year's quarter and both major components, interest income and dividends were essentially flat.
Yields for our bond portfolio were slightly lower than last year. As we reported, the second quarter of 2012 was even with the first quarter at 5.2% on a pre-tax basis and 3.8% on an after-tax basis.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration edged down to 4.3 years from 4.4 years. In our common stock portfolio, we're seeing dividend increases over the past year for most of our holdings, but less funds were at work in that portfolio for much of the past 18 months. Its cost basis is just now approaching its yearend 2010 level, following a reduction in the first half of 2011 of almost 8%.
Our fixed maturity portfolio again experienced a valuation gain during the second quarter. For the equity portfolio, unrealized gains were 8% lower at the end of June compared with March. Still, that portfolio is pre-tax net unrealized gains of $891 million or 12% higher than at the end of 2011.
Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2012, continued at a healthy pace. That helps fuel our investment income and offset the effects of the low interest rate environment.
At $265 million, net cash flow already exceeded the full year 2011 by $18 million. It's on pace to exceed the full year 2010 and 2009, each at roughly $530 million since the second half of the year typically has lower catastrophe loss payments and the bulk of the agency profit sharing was already paid in the first quarter.
Moving to balance sheet highlights, a consistent approach to loss reserving is one of our hallmarks. And metrics for reserve development on prior accident years, demonstrate that consistency.
Through the first six months of this year we benefited from 10.8 percentage points of net favorable reserve development before catastrophe losses. That result came within one-half of a point of 2011's six-month development. Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first half, which totaled $201 million, including catastrophe losses.
Our six-month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 19% for accident year 2011, 30% for accident year 2010, 16% for accident year 2009, and 35% for all older accident years. We also continue to maintain our consistently low debt leverage with a debt to total capital ratio of 14.8% at June 30.
As previously reported, we established a new $225 million line of credit in May. It replaced two credit facilities that totaled the same amount. Six banks participate and it's for a term of five years. Most of the major terms and conditions are similar to the former credit facilities, but we gained some flexibility in terms of borrowing capacity such as raising the debt to total capital covenant to 30% from 20%.
In addition to enhancing our already great financial flexibility with a new credit facility, we once again ended the quarter holding over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level. Our capital will remain strong and is available to support additional premium growth in our Insurance segments.
I'll conclude my prepared comments as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. Property Casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.31. Life Insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.44.
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.40. And we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to shareholders.
The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.41 during the second quarter to $31.66 per share. That result is 2% above the yearend level contributing to the first half value creation ratio of 4.6%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

The implementation of the predicted modeling, has been a big contributor to guiding us on the pricing. We'll be introducing our second generation of that model. We in fact are in the process of doing that right now.
But in addition to that, we've done a lot more in loss control, specifically on accounts greater than $50,000. Every single one of those accounts is going through a more rigorous review by our loss control division they're are scored, based on the review. That resulted in a lot more insight on the accounts that we write.
I think really, and Marty might want to add to this, Marty Mullen, our Chief Claims Officer. But in the claims area, there's been a tremendous amount of specialization and both in terms of putting loss control specialists in the fields, but bill repricing has contributed significantly.
We have call center now where we ask the policyholder to call directly into Cincinnati, which accelerates the lag between when the injury occurs and when we are able to triage the injury, and address how it's going to be handled.
So all of those things have contributed. Pricing continues to be therefore a force in the comp area. That still remains consistent. I think in terms of the contribution that loss control and claims will give us, we think there's still some to be gained there."

If you take our ex-cat net underwriting results for property through year-to-date, we're running at if we were to have average cats, at about 105 combined ratio for commercial property.
It's not horrible, considering the kind of cats that we've had, but it's certainly not satisfactory. So we are expanding geographically, but honestly the population of Idaho and Utah and Oregon, that alone is not enough to balance out the kinds of concentrations, we have more in the Midwest.
So we're trying to spend a lot more time here in the Midwest trying to identify ways in addition to rate and property rates are solidly getting into the upper single-digit ranges, and they're accelerating.
But we've got a lot going on with deductible increases in property, a lot more discussion in the marketplace about percentage deductibles. There is a tolerance on that though.
In coastal areas, people are used to 2% and 5% win deductibles, in the Midwest they are not, but there's a lot more discussion there. We're taking a lot closer look at habitational risks, apartments, condos, all type of things that have asphalt shingles, very much susceptible to hail types of claims. Those are areas where we're looking at much stronger deductibles.
Less owner risk only property, you may hear a lot of other carriers talk about that, but in addition to rough exposures there, we've spend a lot more time verifying through inspections and loss control, who the tenants are, whether or not during these tougher economic times, maintenance might have deteriorated.
Claim specialization is part of what we're doing in the property area, as well. And I mentioned loss control but specifically, in terms of inspections we're doing a lot more in that area and adding a lot more in loss control.
So the solution to property filling the Commercial Line side, it's not monumental. We want that combined ratio including tax to be in the 90 range. We think we are that kind of company, but there is a lot other moving parts to trigger it there."

It's a huge contributor to it, but there are lot of other things that you might call non-modeled attributes. So we take that down to the policy levels, and so actually, if you can do that we can take it down to the agency level, to the field territory level, to the state level.
The fact of the matter is that in terms of all the new business we've written in 2012 to date, agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011, the business we've written from those folks has been most price adequate, of all the new business we've written throughout the year.

One way of the agency making that happen, is to consolidate the number of carriers they have in the agency. So we may be given an opportunity to look at business, simply because they want to cut down the number of carriers they have.
Some carriers in the marketplace have announced that they're going to take a very, very tough pricing approach. That they are going to get a minimum rate increase on all of their renewals, translation, agency shops most of that business just to be on guard, so we see some business because of that.
The three-year policy is a significant advantage, I guess, or certainly an important thing for an agency, right now. There is an expectation that pricing increases will continue, that the market will continue firm for a while.

And that, the way we provide for the cat provision is we used RMS version 11, they are most recent up-to-date model. One that is pretty conservative. But we use the RMS version 11 model.
We then put in at a very granular level, right down to the street address, our current exposures. What is the coverage A and all the characteristics of the houses that we write, so that we have both a current model and a current picture of our exposures.
The model is run at numerous scenarios, thousands of scenarios are generated and we come up with an expected value for catastrophe losses, and that is what we build into our rate level.
So it's not our last 20 years of history or our last 10 or any years of history, it's what does the most recent model show. And so then we're at a point where we're comparing, what actually happens versus what did we built into the models.

Mike will discuss investment details in a few moments.
Underwriting performance before the effects of catastrophes was very much improved compared with the year ago, similar to recent quarters. On the other hand catastrophe losses continued above historical norms for us and for many in our industry.
Previously announced second quarter catastrophe losses added nearly 18 points to our combined ratio. Improved underwriting performance in part reflected pricing for property casualty policies that continue to increase. Overall, pricing was up a bit from the first quarter.
Each of our Property Casualty segments again had healthy levels of net written premium growth. They each grew at a double-digit pace during the second quarter and our Life Insurance segments earned premium rose likewise. Factoring out reinsurance effects property casualty written premiums rose 12%, and were satisfied because more precise and overall higher pricing was a large contributor.
Commercial Lines renewal pricing moved somewhat higher in the second quarter compared with the first. Overall, average increases were in the mid single-digit range, including the blending effect of three year policies. Renewals of workers compensation and smaller commercial property policies again experienced stronger pricing during the second quarter than most of our other lines of business.
Our Excess and Surplus line segment had a higher renewal price for the 22nd consecutive month, again in a high single-digit range. And personalized premiums continued to experience rate increases over successive years with renewal premiums up 11% for the second quarter and first half of 2012.
Policy retention for Commercial and Personal Lines continues to remain steady in its contribution to total written premiums. The contribution of new businesses is increasing in significance, reflecting benefits from both higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Property Casualty new business premiums in the second quarter were 12% higher than a year ago. Recently appointed agencies again drove that growth. As of June 30, we have appointed 93 new agencies on pace toward a full-year target of 130.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools help us determine when to walk away from business that we believe is underpriced as well as when to have the confidence to compete for good accounts.
We are studying our property book of business and identifying opportunities to improve underwriting results for the property lines. Our approach is similar to the multifaceted effort that has been improving our workers compensation results. We've already put in place some of the pieces and in the future we will further discuss plans and progress.
Over time, we'll also benefit from earning the rate increases we've taken on property coverages. On a written premium basis in recent quarters, those property rate increases have outpaced the increases taken on much of our non-property business.
Our total property casualty combined ratio for the first half of 2012 showed good improvement over 2011, on both a current accident year and calendar year basis. That improvement holds up however you analyze it, with or without the effects of catastrophes and the extra reinsurance costs in 2011.
We're continuing to see the benefits of ongoing efforts to improve pricing, underwriting and claims management. We are confident further benefits will manifest in our operating results. At the same time, we remain steadfast in our approach to service excellence, reserve adequacy, investment management and strong capital.
Now, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on several financial items."

Our investment portfolio continued its steady contribution to earnings in the second quarter. Investment income again matched the prior year's quarter and both major components, interest income and dividends were essentially flat.
Yields for our bond portfolio were slightly lower than last year. As we reported, the second quarter of 2012 was even with the first quarter at 5.2% on a pre-tax basis and 3.8% on an after-tax basis.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration edged down to 4.3 years from 4.4 years. In our common stock portfolio, we're seeing dividend increases over the past year for most of our holdings, but less funds were at work in that portfolio for much of the past 18 months. Its cost basis is just now approaching its yearend 2010 level, following a reduction in the first half of 2011 of almost 8%.
Our fixed maturity portfolio again experienced a valuation gain during the second quarter. For the equity portfolio, unrealized gains were 8% lower at the end of June compared with March. Still, that portfolio is pre-tax net unrealized gains of $891 million or 12% higher than at the end of 2011.
Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2012, continued at a healthy pace. That helps fuel our investment income and offset the effects of the low interest rate environment.
At $265 million, net cash flow already exceeded the full year 2011 by $18 million. It's on pace to exceed the full year 2010 and 2009, each at roughly $530 million since the second half of the year typically has lower catastrophe loss payments and the bulk of the agency profit sharing was already paid in the first quarter.
Moving to balance sheet highlights, a consistent approach to loss reserving is one of our hallmarks. And metrics for reserve development on prior accident years, demonstrate that consistency.
Through the first six months of this year we benefited from 10.8 percentage points of net favorable reserve development before catastrophe losses. That result came within one-half of a point of 2011's six-month development. Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first half, which totaled $201 million, including catastrophe losses.
Our six-month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years, including 19% for accident year 2011, 30% for accident year 2010, 16% for accident year 2009, and 35% for all older accident years. We also continue to maintain our consistently low debt leverage with a debt to total capital ratio of 14.8% at June 30.
As previously reported, we established a new $225 million line of credit in May. It replaced two credit facilities that totaled the same amount. Six banks participate and it's for a term of five years. Most of the major terms and conditions are similar to the former credit facilities, but we gained some flexibility in terms of borrowing capacity such as raising the debt to total capital covenant to 30% from 20%.
In addition to enhancing our already great financial flexibility with a new credit facility, we once again ended the quarter holding over $1 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level. Our capital will remain strong and is available to support additional premium growth in our Insurance segments.
I'll conclude my prepared comments as usual, by summarizing the contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. Property Casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.31. Life Insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than Life Insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.44.
The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.20. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.40. And we paid $0.4025 per share in dividends to shareholders.
The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.41 during the second quarter to $31.66 per share. That result is 2% above the yearend level contributing to the first half value creation ratio of 4.6%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Every single one of those accounts is going through a more rigorous review by our loss control division they're are scored, based on the review. That resulted in a lot more insight on the accounts that we write. I think really, and Marty might want to add to this, Marty Mullen, our Chief Claims Officer. But in the claims area, there's been a tremendous amount of specialization and both in terms of putting loss control specialists in the fields, but bill repricing has contributed significantly. We have call center now where we ask the policyholder to call directly into Cincinnati, which accelerates the lag between when the injury occurs and when we are able to triage the injury, and address how it's going to be handled. So all of those things have contributed. Pricing continues to be therefore a force in the comp area. That still remains consistent. I think in terms of the contribution that loss control and claims will give us, we think there's still some to be gained there."

We have accelerated a little bit this year our equity purchases. We've been net sellers of common stocks I think every year since just prior the crisis.

If you take our ex-cat net underwriting results for property through year-to-date, we're running at if we were to have average cats, at about 105 combined ratio for commercial property. It's not horrible, considering the kind of cats that we've had, but it's certainly not satisfactory. So we are expanding geographically, but honestly the population of Idaho and Utah and Oregon, that alone is not enough to balance out the kinds of concentrations, we have more in the Midwest. So we're trying to spend a lot more time here in the Midwest trying to identify ways in addition to rate and property rates are solidly getting into the upper single-digit ranges, and they're accelerating. But we've got a lot going on with deductible increases in property, a lot more discussion in the marketplace about percentage deductibles. There is a tolerance on that though. In coastal areas, people are used to 2% and 5% win deductibles, in the Midwest they are not, but there's a lot more discussion there. We're taking a lot closer look at habitational risks, apartments, condos, all type of things that have asphalt shingles, very much susceptible to hail types of claims. Those are areas where we're looking at much stronger deductibles. Less owner risk only property, you may hear a lot of other carriers talk about that, but in addition to rough exposures there, we've spend a lot more time verifying through inspections and loss control, who the tenants are, whether or not during these tougher economic times, maintenance might have deteriorated. Claim specialization is part of what we're doing in the property area, as well. And I mentioned loss control but specifically, in terms of inspections we're doing a lot more in that area and adding a lot more in loss control.
So the solution to property filling the Commercial Line side, it's not monumental. We want that combined ratio including tax to be in the 90 range. We think we are that kind of company, but there is a lot other moving parts to trigger it there."

It's a huge contributor to it, but there are lot of other things that you might call non-modeled attributes. So we take that down to the policy levels, and so actually, if you can do that we can take it down to the agency level, to the field territory level, to the state level. The fact of the matter is that in terms of all the new business we've written in 2012 to date, agencies appointed in 2010 and 2011, the business we've written from those folks has been most price adequate, of all the new business we've written throughout the year.

One way of the agency making that happen, is to consolidate the number of carriers they have in the agency. So we may be given an opportunity to look at business, simply because they want to cut down the number of carriers they have. Some carriers in the marketplace have announced that they're going to take a very, very tough pricing approach. That they are going to get a minimum rate increase on all of their renewals, translation, agency shops most of that business just to be on guard, so we see some business because of that. The three-year policy is a significant advantage, I guess, or certainly an important thing for an agency, right now.

What is the coverage A and all the characteristics of the houses that we write, so that we have both a current model and a current picture of our exposures. The model is run at numerous scenarios, thousands of scenarios are generated and we come up with an expected value for catastrophe losses, and that is what we build into our rate level. So it's not our last 20 years of history or our last 10 or any years of history, it's what does the most recent model show. And so then we're at a point where we're comparing, what actually happens versus what did we built into the models.

We",580,"Thank you, Dennis and good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our strong third quarter earnings and operating performance.
Looking first at Property Casualty Insurance, our 94.8% combined ratio was our best so far this year. We’ve now posted three consecutive quarters with the combined ratio before catastrophe losses below 90% and that followed 90.4% for the fourth quarter of last year.
Furthermore, our Property Casualty combined ratio for the first nine months of 2012 is a good indicator of progress on our strategic initiatives. On both a current accident year and calendar year basis before catastrophe losses, it improved by about 10 percentage points from a year ago.
As for premium growth, each of our Property Casualty segments experienced double-digit increases in third quarter net written premiums. Property Casualty underwriting results, both profitability and premium growth continued to benefit from higher and more precise pricing in the third quarter. Commercial lines renewal price increases on average were in the mid single digit range and were up slightly from the second quarter. Workers’ compensation in smaller commercial property policies again led the way.
Our excess and surplus lines segment had higher renewal prices for the 25th consecutive month. The increases were in the high single digit range, which was slightly higher than the second quarter.
Personal lines renewal written premiums were up 11% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 with rate increase and policy account growth each contributing about half. New business written premiums from the third quarter and nine month periods grew at a double digit pace for both our commercial and personal lines segments driven by higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools continue to indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools give us confidence to compete for good accounts and to avoid the underpriced ones. Also the increase in new business production over the last year’s third quarter was evenly split between more newly appointed agencies and more established agencies.
One area that needs our focus is underwriting for property oriented lines of business. We are working through several initiatives in addition to higher pricing to improve results. Those initiatives have several key components. We now have more specialization and enhanced expertise amongst our underwriting and loss control associates. We’re increasing the number of properties we inspect as part of new business and renewal underwriting and we’re making greater use of wind and hail deductibles in areas prone to convective storm losses.
Turning briefly to investment income, it has been fairly steady for the first nine months of this year with growth in the third quarter due to a spike in dividends from our equity portfolio. Similarly, our life insurance business including these investments generated a nine-month 2012 operating profit to match last year’s despite declining bond yields.
Term life insurance, our largest life insurance product line grew earned premiums at a high single digit rate for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012. We’re making good progress overall. Our associates are committed to providing the highest level of service to our agents and we all remain focused on creating value for shareholders. Our value creation ratio was strong in the third quarter.
I will turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to explain the components that drove that result.

Our third quarter value creation ratio was 5.4% including 1.3% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 4.1% from the change in book value per share. I will now review the components for the third quarter change in book value per share.
Property Casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.42. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value by $0.56 and we paid $0.4075 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.29 during the third quarter to $32.95 per share.
The third quarter was a good example of the benefits of our equity investing strategy in midst of a low interest rate environment. Our common stock portfolio experienced higher than usual dividend increases in the third quarter contributing to a 17% increase in dividend income. That growth pace is unlikely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2012 as timing differences in dividend payments from our current holdings will create a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparison. Yields for our bond portfolio continue to edge lower with the reported third quarter 2012 pre-tax yield of 5.10%, down 15 basis points from a year ago.
Our bond portfolio’s effective duration remained steady at 4.3 years. We continue to put money to work in both our bond and stock portfolios, but in recent months the allocation to the stock portfolio has been relatively higher. Strong cash flow is also helping our investment income. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2012, stands at $433 million. That total is already within a $100 million of full year 2009 and 2010 and it already exceeds the full year 2011 by $186 million. Both our stock and bond portfolios had nice valuation gains during the third quarter reflected in a fair value being up 7% and 1%, respectively. The stock portfolio’s unrealized gains now exceed $1 billion before taxes and its fair value represents just over one quarter of invested assets.
In terms of the liability side of the balance sheet, we continue to emphasize a consistent approach to loss reserving. Through the first nine months of this year, our combined ratio benefited from 10 percentage points of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses, very close to 9.9 points for the same period a year ago.
Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first nine months, which totaled $287 million including catastrophe losses. Our nine month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years including 33% for accident year 2011, 22% for accident year 2010, 20% for accident year 2009 and 25% for all older accident years.
Finally, financial strength and liquidity remained excellent. We ended the quarter holding over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level, up 19% from June 30.
In conclusion, our capital remained strong and is available to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments and other capital needs. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Steve.

For us, looking at the current accident year the forecast on a year-to-date basis were 72.2 which is about equal to where we were through nine months of last year. We did see some adverse development of 4.9 loss ratio points during the quarter, but as I look at it quarter-by-quarter, going back over the past two years as we show on the supplement, we’ve actually seen some quarters with considerable favorable development, a few with adverse development. So, I kind of try to look at the big picture there and I think that we’ve been very consistent in our approach of reserving.
I do think, in terms of a positive that we are getting rate in commercial auto and that that rate is in excess of what we’re seeing in terms of our loss cost trends, but we’re going to keep an awful close eye on it, continue to get rate where we think it’s needed and look for improvement in the future.

And then I’d also be curious of your thoughts maybe now initially, if as we work through the next few quarters, if we should expect because of the year-on-year compounding if renewal rate increases should maybe taper off in the next few quarters as you get rate on rate, or should the current run rate keep persisting on the commercial lines renewal.

In terms of our capital management it has been behind dividend in terms of our emphasis but we’ll look at all those measures in terms of ways to deploy the capital.
I think also we have a good investment strategy and I think this is the first year in a while that we’ve actually increased the amount of cash that we’ve deployed in terms of buying common stocks and I think that’s a positive.

It’s just in general, as we look at new business, we feel that the relative adequacy of the rate for the group, all of the new business relative to all the renewal business is better and I think it probably has to do with the renewal book which is most of the business. Having been through a soft market, having been driven down in terms of its price, with a new piece of business you look at it in a fresh light and you make a decision of, you know, will we write that piece of new business and at what price. And so, just as we look at overall, the total book of new business vis-à-vis the total book of renewal business, we see relatively better pricing on the new business.

In sum, more active agencies where we write a large share or the agencies themselves are large. They may call on us as few as six agencies in rural areas where the activity level per agency is smaller, they might call on as many as many 20 or 24 agencies.

So, I think it runs the game between regionals and nationals. One of the tractions that they use in Cincinnati Insurance Company is that we do use a three-year policy. We charge more for it, but right now we’re really in the middle of a period of time where rates are rising. No one knows for sure how long they will. So as a company, I think, that’s an attractive option. I think the biggest difference is that, relatively speaking, our field reps have relatively few agencies they call on. In higher activity agencies, they are in there once a week. They are visiting producers. They are going out and seeing the risk. It’s the same model we’ve had for years, it produces results for us. So we get perhaps more of our share of that, that’s a business that we’d like to write.
I think also particularly given the amount of claim activity we had with the weather, all of our field claim reps are assigned to agencies. They are in the agency’s office on a regular basis. The conscious decision an agency makes just in terms of momentum of where business goes in an agency, certainly price is an issue, but probably in my view and I think our - if you ask our agencies in their view, the way that they know their policyholders to be treated if they have a claim gives them a lot of confidence to put a significant portion of their business with us.
Finally, I guess I’d add that in every one of our field we have excess and surplus lines, property, personal lines field reps, machine and equipment, premium auditors, all assigned to agencies, all get to know the agencies pretty well. I know it sounds a bit corny but our agencies are doing business with the Cincinnati family and there is just a lot of confidence and consistency on that.

We",578,"Thank you, Dennis and good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our strong third quarter earnings and operating performance.
Looking first at property casualty Insurance, our 94.8% combined ratio was our best so far this year. We’ve now posted 3 consecutive quarters with the combined ratio before catastrophe losses below 90% and that followed 90.4% for the fourth quarter of last year.
Furthermore, our property casualty combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2012 is a good indicator of progress on our strategic initiatives. On both a current accident year and calendar year basis before catastrophe losses, it improved by about 10 percentage points from a year ago.
As for premium growth, each of our property casualty segments experienced double-digit increases in third quarter net written premiums. Property casualty underwriting results, both profitability and premium growth continued to benefit from higher and more precise pricing in the third quarter. Commercial lines renewal price increases on average were in the mid single digit range and were up slightly from the second quarter. Workers’ compensation in smaller commercial property policies again led the way.
Our excess and surplus lines segment had higher renewal prices for the 25th consecutive month. The increases were in the high single digit range, which was slightly higher than the second quarter.
Personal lines renewal written premiums were up 11% for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012 with rate increase and policy account growth each contributing about half. New business written premiums from the third quarter and 9-month periods grew at a double digit pace for both our commercial and personal lines segments driven by higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools continue to indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools give us confidence to compete for good accounts and to avoid the underpriced ones. Also the increase in new business production over the last year’s third quarter was evenly split between more newly appointed agencies and more established agencies.
One area that needs our focus is underwriting for property-oriented lines of business. We are working through several initiatives in addition to higher pricing to improve results. Those initiatives have several key components. We now have more specialization and enhanced expertise amongst our underwriting and loss control associates. We’re increasing the number of properties we inspect as part of new business and renewal underwriting and we’re making greater use of wind and hail deductibles in areas prone to convective storm losses.
Turning briefly to investment income, it has been fairly steady for the first 9 months of this year with growth in the third quarter due to a spike in dividends from our equity portfolio. Similarly, our life insurance business including these investments generated a 9-month 2012 operating profit to match last year’s despite declining bond yields.
Term life insurance, our largest life insurance product line grew earned premiums at a high single digit rate for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2012. We’re making good progress overall. Our associates are committed to providing the highest level of service to our agents and we all remain focused on creating value for shareholders. Our value creation ratio was strong in the third quarter.
I will turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to explain the components that drove that result."

Our third quarter value creation ratio was 5.4% including 1.3% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 4.1% from the change in book value per share. I will now review the components",577,"Thank you Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter value creation ratio was 5.4% including 1.3% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 4.1% from the change in book value per share. I will now review the components for the third quarter change in book value per share.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.42. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value by $0.56 and we paid $0.4075 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.29 during the third quarter to $32.95 per share.
The third quarter was a good example of the benefits of our equity investing strategy in midst of a low interest rate environment. Our common stock portfolio experienced higher than usual dividend increases in the third quarter contributing to a 17% increase in dividend income. That growth pace is unlikely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2012 as timing differences in dividend payments from our current holdings will create a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparison. Yields for our bond portfolio continue to edge lower with the reported third quarter 2012 pre-tax yield of 5.10%, down 15 basis points from a year ago.
Our bond portfolio’s effective duration remained steady at 4.3 years. We continue to put money to work in both our bond and stock portfolios, but in recent months the allocation to the stock portfolio has been relatively higher. Strong cash flow is also helping our investment income. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2012, stands at $433 million. That total is already within a $100 million of full year 2009 and 2010 and it already exceeds the full year 2011 by $186 million. Both our stock and bond portfolios had nice valuation gains during the third quarter reflected in a fair value being up 7% and 1%, respectively. The stock portfolio’s unrealized gains now exceed $1 billion before taxes and its fair value represents just over 1/4 of invested assets.
In terms of the liability side of the balance sheet, we continue to emphasize a consistent approach to loss reserving. Through the first 9 months of this year, our combined ratio benefited from 10 percentage points of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses, very close to 9.9 points for the same period a year ago.
Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first 9 months, which totaled $287 million including catastrophe losses. Our 9 month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years including 33% for accident year 2011, 22% for accident year 2010, 20% for accident year 2009 and 25% for all older accident years.
Finally, financial strength and liquidity remained excellent. We ended the quarter holding over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level, up 19% from June 30.
In conclusion, our capital remained strong and is available to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments and other capital needs. With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve."

This is Steve and I’ll take a stab at it and turn it over to J.F, if he has anything to add. I think what we’re seeing is, I think there was an impact from the recession or the economic downturn that we went through. We’re actually business insurance, the driving is more related to economic activity than maybe say personal auto. And so, as we went into the economic downturn, we actually saw improvement in commercial auto results. I think it was somewhat driven by or at least influenced by the downturn. I think as we come out of the downturn now, and we’re seeing somewhat of a recovery, it’s kind of a mild recovery, but we are seeing recovery. We’re seeing some deterioration in the results of the accident year subsequent to the downturn.
For us, looking at the current accident year the forecast on a year-to-date basis were 72.2% which is about equal to where we were through 9 months of last year. We did see some adverse development of 4.9 loss ratio points during the quarter, but as I look at it quarter-by-quarter, going back over the past 2 years as we show on the supplement, we’ve actually seen some quarters with considerable favorable development, a few with adverse development. So, I kind of try to look at the big picture there and I think that we’ve been very consistent in our approach of reserving.
I do think, in terms of a positive, that we are getting rate in commercial auto and that that rate is in excess of what we’re seeing in terms of our loss cost trend, but we’re going to keep an awful close eye on it, continue to get rate where we think it’s needed and look for improvement in the future."

The atmosphere that exists there in talking with agencies about their individual accounts and just pricing in general, is that there is an expectation that pricing increases will continue and there is very little pushback.

In terms of our capital management it has been behind dividend in terms of our emphasis but we’ll look at all those measures in terms of ways to deploy the capital.
I think also we have a good investment strategy and I think this is the first year in a while that we’ve actually increased the amount of cash that we’ve deployed in terms of buying common stocks and I think that’s a positive.

Our three-year policy, the way we handle claims, the fact that we don’t appoint many agencies in an area, all of that, no one thing is the winner, but all of that causes agencies to focus a little bit more intently on doing business with us.
I’d say one of the things that probably, as we report this type of a metric, will have an impact is that there is a lot of merger, acquisition activity in the independent agency system. We’re finding that fortunately that our agencies are in some cases merging with others. That creates a lot more critical mass within the agency and since we weren’t in the new part of that partnership, we may fall out of the #1 or #2 position. We do maintain our position of being a consequential partner for our agencies and that’s the important thing.
We want to be thought of as a company that contributes most significantly to our agencies’ success. So, that continues to be our goal. We think that’s important.

But as was mentioned we have had 25 straight months of rate increases in CSU that continues to go up. So it’s closing in on 10% average net rate increase. So we think we are doing a good job there.
So, no, I’d say we are very satisfied with how things are going, and I guess by way of more color nothing -- we are not writing anything differently this year than we did last. We still have a fairly conservative appetite in that class in the E&S company. So we’re feeling good about it."

The underwriting, the loss control, the inspection, the claims under Marty Mullen’s leadership and the things that we’ve done in workers’ compensation, in terms of the call center that we’ve put in place. The increased specialization that we’ve had in terms of our workers’ comp, whether it’d be from the claims handling, the medical, looking at every issue, turning over every stone, we had been working diligently to improve those results and so we see improvement.
Now, in terms of the exact number of points and so forth on an accident year loss ratio, I think again that is subject to some estimation that we feel certainly confident in the direction that we see, things going and it makes sense, makes good common sense that’s consistent with the initiatives that we’ve been employing."

On the claims side, we’ve mentioned this many times before, but we’ve just had so many initiatives that are yielding terrific results on the worker’s comp side in claims handling.

We have, as I mentioned, 27 territories. We have 1,711 I think it is -- those numbers are -- roughly 1,711 in 2011 or so locations, it averages about 14 locations per field rep.

So, I think it runs the gamut between regionals and nationals. One of the tractions that they use in Cincinnati Insurance Company is that we do use a three-year policy. We charge more for it, but right now we’re really in the middle of a period of time where rates are rising. No one knows for sure how long they will. So as a company, I think, that’s an attractive option. I think the biggest difference is that, relatively speaking, our field reps have relatively few agencies they call on. In higher activity agencies, they are in there once a week. They are visiting producers. They are going out and seeing the risk. It’s the same model we’ve had for years, it produces results for us. So we get perhaps more of our share of that, that’s a business that we’d like to write.
I think also particularly given the amount of claim activity we had with the weather, all of our field claim reps are assigned to agencies. They are in the agency’s office on a regular basis. The conscious decision an agency makes just in terms of momentum of where business goes in an agency, certainly price is an issue, but probably in my view and I think our -- if you ask our agencies in their view, the way that they know their policyholders would be treated if they have a claim gives them a lot of confidence to put a significant portion of their business with us.
Finally, I guess I’d add that in everyone of our field -- we have excess and surplus lines, property, personal lines field reps, machine and equipment, premium auditors, all assigned to agencies, all get to know the agencies pretty well. I know it sounds a bit corny but our agencies are doing business with the Cincinnati family and there is just a lot of confidence and consistency on that."

Looking first at property casualty Insurance, our 94.8% combined ratio was our best so far this year. We’ve now posted 3 consecutive quarters with the combined ratio before catastrophe losses below 90% and that followed 90.4% for the fourth quarter of last year.
Furthermore, our property casualty combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2012 is a good indicator of progress on our strategic initiatives. On both a current accident year and calendar year basis before catastrophe losses, it improved by about 10 percentage points from a year ago.
As for premium growth, each of our property casualty segments experienced double-digit increases in third quarter net written premiums. Property casualty underwriting results, both profitability and premium growth continued to benefit from higher and more precise pricing in the third quarter. Commercial lines renewal price increases on average were in the mid single digit range and were up slightly from the second quarter. Workers’ compensation in smaller commercial property policies again led the way.
Our excess and surplus lines segment had higher renewal prices for the 25th consecutive month. The increases were in the high single digit range, which was slightly higher than the second quarter.
Personal lines renewal written premiums were up 11% for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012 with rate increase and policy account growth each contributing about half. New business written premiums from the third quarter and 9-month periods grew at a double digit pace for both our commercial and personal lines segments driven by higher pricing and the cumulative effect of new agency appointments.
Our pricing analytics and modeling tools continue to indicate that our new business pricing is adequate and stronger overall than for our renewal business. These tools give us confidence to compete for good accounts and to avoid the underpriced ones. Also the increase in new business production over the last year’s third quarter was evenly split between more newly appointed agencies and more established agencies.
One area that needs our focus is underwriting for property-oriented lines of business. We are working through several initiatives in addition to higher pricing to improve results. Those initiatives have several key components. We now have more specialization and enhanced expertise amongst our underwriting and loss control associates. We’re increasing the number of properties we inspect as part of new business and renewal underwriting and we’re making greater use of wind and hail deductibles in areas prone to convective storm losses.
Turning briefly to investment income, it has been fairly steady for the first 9 months of this year with growth in the third quarter due to a spike in dividends from our equity portfolio. Similarly, our life insurance business including these investments generated a 9-month 2012 operating profit to match last year’s despite declining bond yields.
Term life insurance, our largest life insurance product line grew earned premiums at a high single digit rate for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2012. We’re making good progress overall. Our associates are committed to providing the highest level of service to our agents and we all remain focused on creating value for shareholders. Our value creation ratio was strong in the third quarter.
I will turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell to explain the components that drove that result."

Our third quarter value creation ratio was 5.4% including 1.3% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 4.1% from the change in book value per share. I will now review the components for the third quarter change in book value per share.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.42. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value per share by $0.48. The change in unrealized gains at September 30th, for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses raised book value by $0.56 and we paid $0.4075 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.29 during the third quarter to $32.95 per share.
The third quarter was a good example of the benefits of our equity investing strategy in midst of a low interest rate environment. Our common stock portfolio experienced higher than usual dividend increases in the third quarter contributing to a 17% increase in dividend income. That growth pace is unlikely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2012 as timing differences in dividend payments from our current holdings will create a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparison. Yields for our bond portfolio continue to edge lower with the reported third quarter 2012 pretax yield of 5.10%, down 15 basis points from a year ago.
Our bond portfolio’s effective duration remained steady at 4.3 years. We continue to put money to work in both our bond and stock portfolios, but in recent months the allocation to the stock portfolio has been relatively higher. Strong cash flow is also helping our investment income. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2012, stands at $433 million. That total is already within a $100 million of full year 2009 and 2010 and it already exceeds the full year 2011 by $186 million. Both our stock and bond portfolios had nice valuation gains during the third quarter reflected in a fair value being up 7% and 1%, respectively. The stock portfolio’s unrealized gains now exceed $1 billion before taxes and its fair value represents just over 1/4 of invested assets.
In terms of the liability side of the balance sheet, we continue to emphasize a consistent approach to loss reserving. Through the first 9 months of this year, our combined ratio benefited from 10 percentage points of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses, very close to 9.9 points for the same period a year ago.
Every major line of business contributed to the favorable development for the first 9 months, which totaled $287 million including catastrophe losses. Our 9 month net favorable development was again spread over several accident years including 33% for accident year 2011, 22% for accident year 2010, 20% for accident year 2009 and 25% for all older accident years.
Finally, financial strength and liquidity remained excellent. We ended the quarter holding over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level, up 19% from June 30.
In conclusion, our capital remained strong and is available to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments and other capital needs. With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve."

This is Steve and I’ll take a stab at it and turn it over to J.F, if he has anything to add. I think what we’re seeing is, I think there was an impact from the recession or the economic downturn that we went through. We’re actually business insurance, the driving is more related to economic activity than maybe say personal auto. And so, as we went into the economic downturn, we actually saw improvement in commercial auto results. I think it was somewhat driven by or at least influenced by the downturn. I think as we come out of the downturn now, and we’re seeing somewhat of a recovery, it’s kind of a mild recovery, but we are seeing recovery. We’re seeing some deterioration in the results of the accident year subsequent to the downturn. For us, looking at the current accident year the forecast on a year-to-date basis were 72.2% which is about equal to where we were through 9 months of last year. We did see some adverse development of 4.9 loss ratio points during the quarter, but as I look at it quarter-by-quarter, going back over the past 2 years as we show on the supplement, we’ve actually seen some quarters with considerable favorable development, a few with adverse development. So I kind of try to look at the big picture there and I think that we’ve been very consistent in our approach of reserving. I do think, in terms of a positive, that we are getting rate in commercial auto and that that rate is in excess of what we’re seeing in terms of our loss cost trend, but we’re going to keep an awful close eye on it, continue to get rate where we think it’s needed and look for improvement in the future."

I think we are also looking at repurchases. In terms of our capital management it has been behind dividend in terms of our emphasis but we’ll look at all those measures in terms of ways to deploy the capital.
I think also we have a good investment strategy and I think this is the first year in a while that we’ve actually increased the amount of cash that we’ve deployed in terms of buying common stocks and I think that’s a positive.

I tried again to look at -- we tried to look at in a big picture too, and with ex-cats we can’t invest ex-cat dollars and we can’t invest non-weather -- or ex-cat non-weather type dollars. We can only invest our overall net income. So we’re looking at it from the total of trying to do everything we can in terms of pricing, underwriting, inspection, managing our exposure so that we generate positive operating income, positive cash flow and positive net income."

I might add just a little bit to what Steve just said about what we are doing on the underwriting loss control and claims side. We are putting an awful lot of effort into increasing our loss control division of our company and ramping up the amount of physical inspections that we make of the property we insure both in homeowners and in commercial lines. Worker’s comp, we made a lot of progress in worker’s comp, specialization on the claims side, call center on the claim side and loss control, especially the loss control as well that’s contributed a lot of improvement. So I think pricing, as Steve already has described has been a good contributor.

Well, certainly in a softer market where you have quite a few carriers using the price lever to gain better shelf space in an agency that does impact things. There is a certain amount of inconsistency in the marketplace right now in terms of some companies driving rate maybe a little more strongly than some agencies would appreciate. Our 3-year policy, the way we handle claims, the fact that we don’t appoint many agencies in an area, all of that, no one thing is the winner, but all of that causes agencies to focus a little bit more intently on doing business with us. I’d say one of the things that probably, as we report this type of a metric, will have an impact is that there is a lot of merger, acquisition activity in the independent agency system. We’re finding that fortunately that our agencies are in some cases merging with others. That creates a lot more critical mass within the agency and since we weren’t in the new part of that partnership, we may fall out of the #1 or #2 position. We do maintain our position of being a consequential partner for our agencies and that’s the important thing. We want to be thought of as a company that contributes most significantly to our agencies’ success. So that continues to be our goal. We think that’s important. We’re not going to be a big player if you will in agencies and fortunately based on all of the contributions we can make, agencies give us an opportunity to do it."

We did have and I guess there was just a little bit of unusual number of larger claims in E&S. We continue to grow very quickly. We will finish the year somewhere around $105 million in our E&S book of business. So we are reserving as we do on other lines fairly conservatively. So it’s a bit hard to drive the combined ratio down below a 100% with the fast growth and the stronger reserving. So it’s disappointing to have the quarter that we had just from a standpoint of the losses that we had in that line. But as was mentioned we have had 25 straight months of rate increases in CSU that continues to go up. So it’s closing in on 10% average net rate increase. So we think we are doing a good job there. So no, I’d say we are very satisfied with how things are going, and I guess by way of more color nothing -- we are not writing anything differently this year than we did last.

From time to time a field rep will get involved in a renewal to help the home office underwriter. But the field rep’s role is to underwrite and price all the new commercial lines business that we write, promote all the other products we write, but most of the time is spent with the commercial lines. We have, as I mentioned, 27 territories. We have 1,711 I think it is -- those numbers are -- roughly 1,711 in 2011 or so locations, it averages about 14 locations per field rep. In sum, more active agencies where we write a large share or the agencies themselves are large. They may call on us as few as 6 agencies in rural areas where the activity level per agency is smaller, they might call on as many as many 20 or 24 agencies. So that would be how we would split it up. What was the rest of your question, I want to make sure I get to it."

So I think it runs the gamut between regionals and nationals. One of the tractions that they use in Cincinnati Insurance Company is that we do use a 3-year policy. We charge more for it, but right now we’re really in the middle of a period of time where rates are rising. No one knows for sure how long they will. So as a company, I think, that’s an attractive option. I think the biggest difference is that, relatively speaking, our field reps have relatively few agencies they call on. In higher activity agencies, they are in there once a week. They are visiting producers. They are going out and seeing the risk. It’s the same model we’ve had for years, it produces results for us. So we get perhaps more of our share of that, that’s a business that we’d like to write. I think also particularly given the amount of claim activity we had with the weather, all of our field claim reps are assigned to agencies. They are in the agency’s office on a regular basis. The conscious decision an agency makes just in terms of momentum of where business goes in an agency, certainly price is an issue, but probably in my view and I think our -- if you ask our agencies in their view, the way that they know their policyholders would be treated if they have a claim gives them a lot of confidence to put a significant portion of their business with us. Finally, I guess I’d add that in everyone of our field -- we have excess and surplus lines, property, personal lines field reps, machine and equipment, premium auditors, all assigned to agencies, all get to know the agencies pretty well. I know it sounds a bit corny but our agencies are doing business with the Cincinnati family and there is just a lot of confidence and consistency on that."

Commercial casualty is about 15 points better, commercial property about 10 points. So I guess, 2 parts, commercial property is it fair to assume that there was a non-cat weather or a large loss benefit? In commercial casualty I guess I’m a little bit more lacking in explanation, if you could give a little bit more color why there is such a dramatic improvement there? I understand directionally there should be improvement. It is just the magnitude I guess I’m trying to understand."

I think we have been, again sorry to kind of repeat the same issues, but we really have been addressing it holistically for all lines, very granularly every policy in terms rate of rate, precision of the rate, understanding the risk, doing what we can to modify the risk if we can to have a win-win for everybody if we can reduce risk. It’s just we feel the elements of blocking and tackling in doing the business and executing our model has resulted in improvement."
