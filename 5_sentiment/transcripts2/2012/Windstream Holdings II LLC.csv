We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Windstream's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Results. Today's conference call was preceded by our fourth quarter 2011 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language filed in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information, reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
To assist investors, we have provided pro forma results to include the PAETEC business for all periods shown. We will make references to these pro forma results from current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call we are currently developing a unified approach and plan to enhance our disclosures later this year. At this time, we've continued to provide the business operating metrics for legacy Windstream alone, and we have reclassified various integrated solution units to voice and high-speed Internet. Additionally, we have updated the pro forma schedules to reflect the impact of the voluntary change in accounting principle for recognizing the actuarial gains and losses within the pension plan. We've elected to reflect the change in actuarial gains and losses and operating results in the year in which they occur and this mostly affects the longer period of time in order to improve the transparency bit more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on the plan. The historical pro forma results have been adjusted to reflect these changes. We will make references to these pro forma results, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner."

I'm going to make a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2012 guidance.
2011 was an incredibly successful year for Windstream. Throughout the year, we integrated several key acquisitions made in 2010, which truly enhanced our business strategy and expanded our suite of business offering. In December, we add another key business to our portfolio with the acquisition of PAETEC making Windstream a leader in providing communication and technology services nationwide. We also made many success-based capital investment that will enhance future growth, and we made significant improvements to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile. Our pro forma financial results for the year reflect our progress in transforming this business. Our $6.2 billion revenue stream declined 0.3% on a year-over-year basis, and we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.2%, a remarkable accomplishment. We have significantly improved the financial trajectory of Windstream and reached a significant milestone of growing pro forma revenue and adjusted OIBDA during the fourth quarter giving us great momentum heading into 2012. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. We competed acquisition of PAETEC, and I'd like to again welcome to entire PAETEC team to Windstream. Together, we are much a stronger organization with more than 100,000 route miles of fiber, advanced enterprise class data centers and an outstanding business sales team with a nationwide presence, all of which make Windstream a leader in the enterprise space, and I'm very excited about the opportunities ahead for our combined company. 
On the regulatory front, late last year, the SEC issued its plan to modernize federal intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. The plan was largely consistent with our expectation. We expect the financial impact to be manageable and believe the steps we have taken to diversify our revenue stream and focus on growth opportunities will help us navigate through this transition. As we look forward, we will be squarely focused on integrating the newly acquired PAETEC business and executing on our growth strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity to build on the momentum of 2011 and to leverage our expanded market presence and network to deliver advanced communication and technology solution nationwide. 
We also have exciting prospects to continue investing for growth, including fiber-to-the-tower deployment, data center expansion and broadband stimulus projects, all of which offer attractive returns and improve Windstream's growth opportunities going forward. Over the past 6 years, we have pursued a path that we believe positions Windstream to be successful over the long run and allows us to maximize total shareholder returns. Through very targeted acquisitions and solid execution in our legacy business, we have indeed position Windstream for growth. Our goal has been and will continue to be achieving industry-leading shareholder return, and our dividend has played the major role in our return. That said, we are very committed to our dividend and with the set of assets that we have assembled and our improving financial performance, Windstream is well-positioned to easily maintain our dividend and consider other shareholder-friendly activities to enhance return in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to  Brent who will discuss our operating results."

In the fourth quarter, business service revenues",657,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was another very productive and better year for Windstream, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build upon the positive momentum we have coming into 2012. In the fourth quarter, business service revenues increased by 2.5% year-over-year, driven by growth in our strategic services, including special access, integrated solutions and advanced data services. The sales team is doing a fantastic job selling our suite of business products, including data, voice, network and cloud services. With our acquisitions, we have created a robust platform of services and continue to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. The PAETEC acquisition expanded our footprint, which is now nationwide, allowing Windstream to better serve multi-location enterprise customers with advanced technology and communication needs. In our consumer channel, we saw nice improvement in operating trends here in the fourth quarter driven by successful cable switcher promotion. We added 8,000 high-speed Internet customers, growing our broadband customer base by 4% year-over-year. Consumer broadband revenues increased 7% year-over-year as a result of the growth in customers combined with our success selling additional broadband services. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points. As we exit 2011, our consumer broadband penetration is 67% at primary lines, which positions us well to continue our focus on accelerating ARPU growth by selling incremental broadband services and faster speed. 
With respect to the PAETEC integration, we have completed the migration of the corporate systems, including the accounting, payroll and HR applications to the Windstream platform. We began operating as a combined sales team at the beginning of this year and are identifying the best practices within each organization to implement company-wide to ensure unified sales and marketing approach. PAETEC had a similar product set and sales culture to Windstream, which has helped our integration activities. I'm very pleased with our efforts to date, and we expect to realize approximately $50 million of synergies in 2012 and are right on track to achieve $100 million of synergies by 2014. 
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream successful track record of delivering these services, we've had great success winning 5 fiber-to-the-tower contracts from our wireless partners. During 2011, we spent approximately $130 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments, which are success-based and secured with long-term contract that provides attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. We also invested roughly $40 million in data center expansion and continued making investment to improve broadband capacity given the demand for video over our network. In total, we completed roughly $30 million of broadband stimulus projects of which Windstream's investment was $8 million. 
Looking forward in the business channel, we are leveraging our expanded network and service offering to drive new multi-location channels. In addition, we are focused on improving the cross-selling opportunities related to our cloud and managed services offering to target existing customers and drive incremental ARPU. For the small business customers, we're focusing on aggressive bundling, up-selling Windstream services and improving retention. In the residential channel, we are rebranding our consumer high-speed Internet bundle to differentiate our offering and the focus on consumers changing video consumption patterns to over-the-top alternatives. Specifically, we will provide an integrated Internet and entertainment bundle that will leverage Internet services where the road to box that aggregates various entertainment apps and enables customers to augment their Pay TV experience with on-demand TV and movie options. As broadband penetration grows, we will focus on increasing utility of our broadband connection to sell incremental services and applications and increase ARPU. 
In summary, we have exciting plans for both the business and consumer channels and very attractive investment opportunities in 2012, and I'm confident that these initiatives will continue advancing our growth strategy. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who is going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,145646286,261521,"Windstream Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash",1112,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash pension charge of $163 million or $103 million after tax, which we disclosed last month resulting from our pension accounting change. In addition, our GAAP results include approximately $23 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and an after-tax loss of roughly $7 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding all of these items, our adjusted EPS would've been $0.19 for the fourth quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results for the fourth quarter. Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.75 billion, up 0.7% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased $21 million or 2.5%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.5%. Our wholesale revenues declined $2 million or almost 1%, and total product sales were up by $10 million or 17%. Within the business channel, data and integrated services grew by $25 million driven by continued growth in IP, NexGen data and data center services. Carrier services, which is largely special access, was up $10 million year-over-year due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Our business, voice and long distance revenues declined by $15 million related to migration from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $16 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $7 million. In the wholesale channel, Voice and Data revenues, which represent refill services within the former PAETEC business declined by roughly $4 million through the use of the decline. This is offset partially by slight increase in Switched Access, carrier settlements and the higher end user surcharges. Product sales increased by $10 million primarily related to increased business GP and margin-neutral contractors sales. Cash expenses increased $8 million year-over-year or 0.9%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $13 million due to largely to higher cost, bad debt expense and higher salaries. Cost of parts sold increased by $10 million as a result of higher product sales, and SG&A expenses decreased $15 million due to incremental deal synergies. For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $612 million, an increase of 0.4% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. 
Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. Windstream generated total revenues of $6.2 billion, a decrease of 0.3% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $2.4 billion, which represented 1.2% growth year-over-year resulting from the realization of deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $892 million. On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $784 million for 2011, a decrease of roughly 4% year-over-year driven by higher capital expenditures and incremental interest related to PAETEC debt, which was partially offset by higher adjusted OIBDA and a net cash tax refund of $11 million. 
In terms of heritage Windstream 2011 results, I am very pleased with the significant improvements we achieved in our overall revenue trends. During the fourth quarter, heritage revenues declined by roughly $1 million year-over-year, and thus, we were very close to achieving our goal of growing the top line as we exit the year. For the full year, we met the guidance ranges from revenue, OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA. Free cash flow was below the range provided due to the acceleration of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. From our balance sheet perspective, 2011 was a very productive year. We refinanced over $2 billion in higher coupon debt and expanded our revolving line of credit, allowing us to significantly lower cash interest expense in the future. We ended the year within net leverage of 3.67x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to deleveraging back to our historic range of 3.2 to 3.4x and plan to achieve this through debt reduction and adjusted OIBDA growth. Since the first of the year, we have refinanced $300 million of PAETEC 2015 note and recently launched an amendment to our credit facility that will expand a large portion of our term loan and maturity for 2016, and at the same time, allow us to raise $280 million in additional Term Loan A proceeds that will be used to partially pay down our revolving line of credit for future refinancing capacity. In addition, we recently received SEC approval related to 2 spectrum sales, and as a result, expect $55 million of proceeds by the end of the first quarter, which will finance $55 million in integrating -- integration capital that we expand to expand in 2012. 
Turning to 2012, let me now discuss our guidance for the year. We expect revenue to be within the range of $6.18 billion to $6.305 billion. We expected adjusted OIBDA to be within the range of $2.43 billion to $2.5 billion. Given the timing of our expected synergies and the late start to intercarrier compensation recovery mechanisms, it is our expectation that we will show continued improvement in adjusted OIBDA throughout the year. For said differently, our year-over-year performance should improve as we move through the year. We expect to spend between $950 million and $1.05 billion of capital expenditures, which exclude integration capital of $55 million I mentioned previously. Our CapEx guidance range includes over $200 million and fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $45 million related to Windstream's portion of the broadband stimulus projects. We expect the cash tax refund of around $91 million, which reflect the benefit of 50% accelerated depreciation for capital investment and other tax savings initiatives we implemented last year. Our guidance also assumes net cash interest of $659 million, which includes a $29 million December 31, 2011, interest payment that was made in the calendar year of 2012. Even with this extra interest payment and excluding the integration capital I just mentioned, we expect to generate between $840 million to $950 million in adjusted free cash flow for an expected dividend payout ratio of 62% to 70%. 
Looking beyond 2012 from a free cash flow perspective, we are more confident than ever in our ability to continue achieving growth in adjusted OIBDA. This growth, along with significant reductions in capital spending and further declines of cash interest will position us well to easily maintain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future even with the expectation of cash taxes increasing. With that, we'll now take a few of your questions. Allie, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

I'll get started here and bring Jeff and Brent can add if they wished. When we look at our capital guidance for 2012 of $950 million to the $1.05 billion, as I mentioned, we've included over $200 million in investments in fiber to the tower and that compared with roughly a little over $100 million in 2011. And as you look forward, we expect to see significant reductions in that fiber-to-the-tower investment. We've talked about this a lot. This is the time that's been going on over the last 2 years, and we expect that fiber-to-the-tower investment to taper down materially in 2013 and almost be fully wrapped up by 2014. In addition, the other big item we talked about was broadband stimulus expecting to invest approximately $45 million in 2012. We invested approximately $8 million in 2011, and there might be a few reminiscence to spend in 2013 related to the stimulus projects. They'll very immaterial. And beyond that for our data center investment, we've invested approximately $40 million in 2011, and we do expect to spend some dollars in 2012, probably not quite up to $40 million as we look at other options to potentially obtained data center space not to mention the fact that PAETEC gave us a nice set of data center asset that we think we can leverage and be successful with the market, so we don't feel the need to put our capital to work necessarily in 2013 associated with data center space. And then we really don't give a lot of color between consumer and enterprise. I would tell you that we continue to make significant investments in the consumer broadband business. Brent alluded to this in his remarks. This over-the-top video continues to play a more important part in our broadband service. We continue to invest to support that. Last year, we've rolled out our technology that will enable higher speeds in our markets are roughly $40 million dedicated to that effort. Sometimes we refer that technology as a media sell. And we've invested approximately $80 million in strengthening our broadband consumer network in 2011, and we expect to spend at least that much in 2012. And the video sell money we do not necessarily expect to repeat in 2012 but really just be ongoing support and maintenance of our consumer broadband business. Does that help, Michael?"

But I'll tell you what, PAETEC also afforded us as a much broader kind of nationwide platform. And one of the things we talked about really focusing on owned is relocation customers that, yes, we can compete we an AT&T and Verizon and our typical size is more the $10,000 rate is more of an average with the type of deals that we're doing with the monthly recurring revenue standpoint, and that's really a sweet spot where those can focus in terms of what the personalized service asset I think the whole market in the way we're approaching the marketplace. That's really how we're focusing on the business side. I think we're having a lot of success. We just changed our business tagline kind of heading into 2012 as a result of PAETEC acquisition focused on smart solutions and personalized service. And we think those 2 things can really help us with a lot of success in marketplace, and we're seeing that really growing right now and that show would appear as you saw our financial results."

So our sales team is very well-positioned for this personal service approach. And as you think about our footprint, Scott, in the competitive opportunity, this many markets whether its ripe with opportunity where we have relatively low shares. So we're really bullish with what PAETEC and other acquisition have done. When you think about Windstream now in the position to provide great data services, voice services the customers will always need with the network with our fiber optic assets in the cloud with our hosted solution assets. We've never felt better about our ability to sell those competitive markets. And on capital intensity, again, what we expect in 2013 and Tony can add some detail for this I you like, but in 2013, if you back out the decreased the Tony mentioned earlier as it relates to our fiber-to-the-tower division, which will be down significantly and the fact that it can be essentially done with our stimulus spending, we expect our capital intensity are kind of about back to our normalized intensity in this business. So I don't think PAETEC changed that dramatically at all. As we look at it, we've made great progress. Our network is much more robust today. We're anxious to win business. We will make success-based capital investments, but we do fully expect that capital intensity decline in 2013 significantly."

I think when you look at our various components of our business revenues, we now have to break it down to 4 components externally: business, consumer, wholesale and other service revenues. Importantly, when you look at our business revenue trends, we're excited to continue to see growth and planning for acceleration of growth in service revenues. And we think our consumer revenue performance of a decline in 2.5% is very, very solid and especially when you consider leveraging a Dish relationship from a TV perspective, so we don't have the facility-based TV product. But importantly, the wholesale revenues will continue to be a drag on the top line and more so this year because of intercarrier compensation. While the net impact to OIBDA intercarrier compensation is not that material, but you do have reductions to revenue and reductions to expenses. And that's really what's laying down our top line revenue growth and not to  be lost in the other service revenue market that we now have. And that really represents the legacy PAETEC Cavalier consumers CLEC business, very low-margin business. We decided to no longer to actively sell into that market, and we expect to see that business will jump off for number of years and see revenue decline for roughly 20% but importantly, not a lot of impact to OIBDA."

ILEC going to perform as an enterprise carrier. And this has not been a gradual transition. In 2005, when we were even named Windstream at that time, we were named Spinco, we were already conflicting a 5-year strategy to focus more on the enterprise space. So very tactically, over the last 5 years, we put people in place. On the sales side, we hired what they think is one of the most aggressive sales executives and industry over 3 years ago to run our sales organization. You may recall that 2 years ago, we bought New Box, so we bought competitive businesses before. We're in that business today. We've totally we focused our marketing, and it really goes across the whole organization on this enterprise focus. So I feel very well-prepared. The last 3 months, the senior team here has been going around to the various markets talking to our sales team. I'll tell you we've got a very professional sales force and a very unique selling proposition. And when you look at the products and services that we have and the work that our engineers have done to really to transform our network into a real enterprise capable network, there's really nothing that's biggest carriers in the country can offer that we can't today. So because of our experience, the fact that we have retained a lot of management as you look back from New Box, several of their key executives are playing very prominent roles. The leader of the Hosted Solutions business continues to run our data center strategy. We kept 8 senior executives from PAETEC. So with every acquisition, we've supplemented that with in improving our talent. And on the side, we've been improving our talent internally to prepare for this focus, so we've made many changes, and I feel very well-prepared to meet the challenge of growing in the enterprise space."

I think it's very important acquisition for us is it really to multi-location. Brent talked about this in his remarks. We feel like we're more of a national player today, and we can go in and get the customers that's previously we couldn't. And we really have assembled a set of assets. When you think about the cloud computing business and the fiber optic businesses we have acquired, we do have is that the facets today that we believe we can grow. PAETEC deal positions win to go in the business base and was an absolute great strategic fit with our largest acquisition. And in the near-term, we are going to be very focused. And near-term, I'm saying 9 to 12 months on closing and integrating PAETEC. In the future, I will continue to be mindful strategic opportunities that advance our capabilities in strategic growth period. The danger here has always been about -- the strategy has always been about positioning our business more for growth. We will set those within the framework of our plan because this is also very important to  us as well to reduce our total leverage from current levels to our historical range of 3.2% to 3.4. So what that means in terms of acquisition criteria, when we look at transactions, we looked for things that advance strategy to improve revenue trends. They're free cash flow accretive. They generate meaningful synergies, located in attractive markets with a favorable competitive position, great network assets, and importantly, maintain leverage in the same range or better. So this filter obviously reduces the number of deals that would be available to us and right, so that's very important to us. And we do feel like we do have is that the assets that we can grow going forward. So to summarize, as we think about the next 9 to 12 months, we're going to be very focused on integration of PAETEC, which we've made great progress to date on, and we're very focused on getting a lot of that heavy lifting done in the next 12 months. And I would say during that timeframe, digital transactions are unlikely."

Today's conference call was preceded by our earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
To assist investors, we have provided supplemental pro forma financial results to include the PAETEC business for all periods shown. Given that Windstream and PAETEC had different operating metric disclosures, we are currently developing a unified approach and plan to enhance our disclosures later this year. At this time, we've continued to provide the business operating metrics for legacy Windstream alone, and we have reclassified various integrated solution units to voice and high-speed Internet. 
Additionally, we have updated the pro forma schedules to reflect the impact of the voluntary change in accounting principle for recognizing the actuarial gains and losses within the pension plan. We've elected to reflect the change in actuarial gains and losses and operating results in the year in which they occur and not to smooth the effects over a longer period of time, in order to improve transparency by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on the plan. The historical pro forma results have been adjusted to reflect these changes. We will make references to these pro forma results, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. 
Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions.

I'm going to make a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2012 guidance.
2011 was an incredibly successful year for Windstream. Throughout the year, we integrated several key acquisitions made in 2010, which truly enhanced our business strategy and expanded our suite of business offering. In December, we add another key business to our portfolio with the acquisition of PAETEC, making Windstream a leader in providing communications and technology services nationwide. We also made many success-based capital investments that will enhance future growth, and we made significant improvements to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile. 
Our pro forma financial results for the year reflect our progress in transforming this business. Our $6.2 billion revenue stream declined 0.3% on a year-over-year basis, and we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.2%, a remarkable accomplishment. We have significantly improved the financial trajectory of Windstream and reached a significant milestone of growing pro forma revenue and adjusted OIBDA during the fourth quarter, giving us great momentum heading into 2012. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. We competed the acquisition of PAETEC. Now I'd like to, again, welcome the entire PAETEC team to Windstream. Together, we are a much a stronger organization with more than 100,000 route miles of fiber, advanced enterprise-class data centers and an outstanding business sales team with a nationwide presence, all of which make Windstream a leader in the enterprise space, and I'm very excited about the opportunities ahead for our combined company. 
On the regulatory front, late last year, the SEC issued its plan to modernize federal intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. The plan was largely consistent with our expectation. We expect the financial impact to be manageable and believe the steps we have taken to diversify our revenue stream and focus on growth opportunities will help us navigate through this transition. 
As we look forward, we will be squarely focused on integrating the newly acquired PAETEC business and executing on our growth strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity to build on the momentum of 2011 and to leverage our expanded market presence and network to deliver advanced communications and technology solutions nationwide. We also have exciting prospects to continue investing for growth, including fiber-to-the-tower deployment, data center expansion and broadband stimulus projects, all of which offer attractive returns and improve Windstream's growth opportunities going forward. 
Over the past 6 years, we have pursued a path that we believe positions Windstream to be successful over the long run and allows us to maximize total shareholder returns. Through very targeted acquisitions and solid execution in our legacy business, we have indeed positioned Windstream for growth. Our goal has been and will continue to be achieving industry-leading shareholder return, and our dividend has played a major role in our return. 
That said, we are very committed to our dividend. And with a set of assets that we have assembled and our improving financial performance, Windstream is well positioned to easily maintain our dividend and consider other shareholder-friendly activities to enhance returns in the future.  
With that, let me turn the call over to  Brent who will discuss our operating results."

In the fourth quarter, business service revenue",660,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was another very productive and pivotal year for Windstream, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build upon the positive momentum we have coming into 2012. In the fourth quarter, business service revenues increased by 2.5% year-over-year driven by growth in our strategic services, including special access, integrated solutions and advanced data services. 
The sales team is doing a fantastic job selling our enhanced suite of business products, including data, voice, network and cloud services. With our acquisitions, we have created a robust platform of services and continue to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. The PAETEC acquisition expanded our footprint, which is now nationwide, allowing Windstream to better serve multi-location enterprise customers with advanced technology and communication needs. 
In the consumer channel, we saw nice improvements in operating trends here in the fourth quarter, driven by successful cable switcher promotion. We added 8,000 high-speed Internet customers, growing our broadband customer base by 4% year-over-year. Consumer broadband revenues increased 7% year-over-year as a result of the growth in customers, combined with our success selling additional broadband services. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points. As we exit 2011, our consumer broadband penetration is 67% of primary lines, which positions us well to continue our focus on accelerating ARPU growth by selling incremental broadband services and faster speed. 
With respect to the PAETEC integration, we have completed the migration of the corporate systems, including the accounting, payroll and HR applications to the Windstream platform. We began operating as a combined sales team at the beginning of this year and are identifying the best practices within each organization to implement company-wide to ensure unified sales and marketing approach. PAETEC had a very similar product set and sales culture to Windstream, which has helped in our integration activities. I'm very pleased with our efforts to date, and we expect to realize approximately $50 million of synergies in 2012 and are right on track to achieve $100 million of synergies by 2014. 
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream successful track record of delivering these services, we have had great success winning fiber-to-the-tower contracts from our wireless partners. During 2011, we spent approximately $130 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments, which are success based and secured with long-term contracts that provide attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. We also invested roughly $40 million in data center expansion and continued making investment to improve broadband capacity, given the demand for video over our network. In total, we completed roughly $30 million of broadband stimulus projects, of which Windstream's investment was $8 million. 
Looking forward, in the business channel, we are leveraging our expanded network and service offerings to drive new multi-location sales. In addition, we are focused on improving the cross-selling opportunities related to our cloud and managed services offerings to target existing customers and drive incremental ARPU. For the small business customers, we're focusing on aggressive bundling, up-selling Windstream services and improving retention. 
In the residential channel, we are rebranding our consumer high-speed Internet bundle to differentiate our offering and focus on consumers' changing video consumption patterns to over-the-top alternatives. Specifically, we will provide an integrated Internet and entertainment bundle that will leverage Internet services with a Roku box that aggregates various entertainment apps and enables customers to augment their pay TV experience with on-demand TV and movie options. 
As broadband penetration grows, we will focus on increasing the utility of our broadband connections to sell incremental services and applications and increase ARPU. In summary, we have exciting plans for both the business and consumer channels and very attractive investment opportunities in 2012, and I'm confident that these initiatives will continue advancing our growth strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,145646286,261704,"Windstream Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2012",2012-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash",1118,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash pension charge of $163 million or $103 million after tax, which we disclosed last month resulting from our pension accounting change. In addition, our GAAP results include approximately $23 million in after tax merger and integration expense and an after tax loss of roughly $7 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding all of these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19 for the fourth quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results for the fourth quarter. Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.75 billion, up 0.7% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased $21 million or 2.5%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.5%. Our wholesale revenues declined $2 million or almost 1%, and total product sales were up by $10 million or 17%. Within the business channel, data and integrated services grew by $25 million, driven by continued growth in IP next-gen data and data center services. 
Carrier services, which is largely special access, was up $10 million year-over-year due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Business voice and long distance revenues declined by $15 million, related to migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $16 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $7 million. In the wholesale channel, voice and data revenues, which represent refill services within the former PAETEC business, declined by roughly $4 million due to usage decline. This was offset partially by slight increase in Switched Access, carrier settlements and the higher end USF and user surcharges. 
Product sales increased by $10 million, primarily related to increased business CPE and margin-neutral contractor sales. Cash expenses increased $8 million year-over-year or 0.9%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $13 million due largely to higher interconnect costs, bad debt expense and higher salaries. Cost of products sold increased by $10 million as a result of higher product sales, and SG&A expenses decreased $15 million due to incremental deal synergies. For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $612 million, an increase of 0.4% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. 
Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. Windstream generated total revenues of $6.2 billion, a decrease of 0.3% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $2.4 billion, which represented 1.2% growth year-over-year, resulting from the realization of deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $892 million. On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $784 million in 2011, a decrease of roughly 4% year-over-year, driven by higher capital expenditures and incremental interest related to PAETEC debt, which was partially offset by higher adjusted OIBDA and a net cash tax refund of $11 million. 
In terms of heritage Windstream 2011 results, I am very pleased with the significant improvements we achieved in our overall revenue trends. During the fourth quarter, heritage revenues declined by roughly $1 million year-over-year, and thus, we were very close to achieving our goal of growing the top line as we exited the year. For the full year, we met the guidance ranges for revenue, OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA. Free cash flow was below the range provided due to the acceleration of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
From a balance sheet perspective, 2011 was a very productive year. We refinanced over $2 billion in higher coupon debt and expanded our revolving line of credit, allowing us to significantly lower cash interest expense in the future. We ended the year with net leverage of 3.67x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to deleveraging back to our historic range of 3.2 to 3.4x and plan to achieve this through debt reduction and adjusted OIBDA growth. 
Since the first of the year, we have refinanced $300 million of PAETEC 2015 note and recently launched an amendment to our credit facility that will extend a large portion of our term loan A maturity to 2016 and, at the same time, allow us to raise $280 million in additional term loan A proceeds that will be used to partially pay down our revolving line of credit, creating future refinancing capacity. In addition, we recently received FCC approval related to 2 spectrum sales and, as a result, expect $55 million of proceeds by the end of the first quarter, which will finance the $55 million in integrating -- integration capital that we expect to expand in 2012. 
Turning to 2012, let me now discuss our guidance for the year. We expect revenue to be within the range of $6.18 billion to $6.305 billion. We expected adjusted OIBDA to be within the range of $2.43 billion to $2.5 billion. Given the timing of our expected synergies and the late start of the intercarrier compensation recovery mechanism, it is our expectation that we will show continued improvement in adjusted OIBDA throughout the year, or said differently, our year-over-year performance should improve as we move through the year. 
We expect to spend between $950 million and $1.05 billion of capital expenditures, which exclude the integration capital of $55 million I mentioned previously. Our CapEx guidance range includes over $200 million in fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $45 million related to Windstream's portion of the broadband stimulus projects. We expect the cash tax refund of around $91 million, which reflects the benefit of 50% accelerated depreciation for capital investment and other tax savings initiatives we implemented last year. 
Our guidance also assumes net cash interest of $659 million, which includes a $29 million December 31, 2011, interest payment that was made in the calendar year of 2012. Even with this extra interest payment and excluding the integration capital I just mentioned, we expect to generate between $840 million to $950 million in adjusted free cash flow or an expected dividend payout ratio of 62% to 70%. 
Looking beyond 2012 from a free cash flow perspective, we are more confident than ever in our ability to continue achieving growth in adjusted OIBDA. This growth, along with significant reductions in capital spending and further declines of cash interest will position us well to easily maintain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future, even with the expectation of cash taxes increasing. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Allie, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

I'll get it started here and Brent and Jeff can add in as they wish. But -- when you look at our capital guidance for 2012 of $950 million to the $1.05 billion, as I mentioned, we've included over $200 million in investments in fiber to the tower and that compares with roughly a little over $100 million in 2011. And as you look forward, we expect to see significant reductions in that fiber-to-the-tower investment. We've talked about this a lot, but this is kind of a land grab that's been going on for the last 2 years, and we expect that fiber-to-the-tower investment to taper down materially in 2013 and almost be fully wrapped up by 2014. In addition, the other big item we talked about was broadband stimulus expecting to invest approximately $45 million in 2012. We invested approximately $8 million in 2011, and there might be a few remnants of spend in 2013 related to the stimulus projects. They'll be very immaterial. And then beyond that for our data center investment, we've invested approximately $40 million in 2011, and we do expect to spend some dollars in 2012, probably not quite up to $40 million, as we look at other options to potentially obtain data center space, not to mention the fact that PAETEC gave us a nice set of data center assets that we think we can leverage and be successful at the market. So we don't feel the need to put our capital to work necessarily in 2013 associated with data center space. And then we really don't give a lot of color between consumer and enterprise. I would tell you that we continue to make significant investments in the consumer broadband business. Brent alluded to this in his remarks. As over-the-top video continues to play a more important part in our broadband service, we continue to invest to support that. Last year, we've rolled out a technology that enabled higher speeds in our markets of roughly $40 million dedicated to that effort, sometimes we refer to that technology as VDSL. And we invested approximately $80 million in strengthening our broadband consumer network in 2011, and we expect to spend at least that much in 2012. And the VDSL monies, we do not necessarily expect to repeat in 2012, but really just the ongoing support and maintenance of our consumer broadband business. Does that help, Michael?"

And who -- are you out there competing with AT&T and Verizon on these, now that you have a more of a national footprint, or is it more on the CLEC side? And then I guess if I could just piggyback off of the last question, maybe to look a little bit further out because I think the details you gave for '12 is really good.

Kind of growing momentum in the marketplace in terms of need for incremental bandwidth is helping. But I'll tell you what, PAETEC also afforded us is a much broader kind of nationwide platform. And one of the things we talked about really focusing on is multi-location customers. That yes, we can compete with an AT&T and Verizon, but I'll tell you, our typical size is more in the $2,000 to $10,000 range, is more on average with the type of deals we're doing from a monthly recurring revenue standpoint. And that's not really a sweet spot where those folks can focus in terms of with the personalized service aspect. That's the hallmark of the way we're approaching the marketplace. So that's really how we're focusing on the business side, and I think we're having a lot of success. We just changed our business tagline, kind of heading into 2012 as a result of PAETEC acquisition, focused on smart solutions and personalized service. And we think those 2 things can really help us with a lot of success in the marketplace, and we're seeing that really growing right now.

That is complementary to a very aggressive sales team that we inherited from NuVox and complementary to our own internal refocus.

And as you think about our footprint, Scott, in the competitive opportunity, there's many, many markets where there -- that's ripe with opportunity, where we have relatively low shares. So we're really bullish on what PAETEC and other acquisitions have done. When you think about Windstream, now in a position to provide great data services, voice services that customers will always need with the network, with our fiber optic assets, in the cloud with our hosted solution assets. So we've never felt better about our ability to sell in those competitive markets. And on capital intensity, again, what we expect in 2013, and Tony can add some detail to this if you'd like, but in 2013, if you back out the decrease that Tony mentioned earlier as it relates to our fiber-to-the-tower initiative, which will be down significantly, and the fact that we're going to be essentially done with our stimulus spending, we expect our capital intensity to kind of revert back to kind of our normalized intensity in this business. And so I don't think PAETEC changed that dramatically at all. As we look at it, we've made great progress. Our network is much more robust today. We're anxious to win business. We will make success-based capital investments, but we do fully expect that capital intensity to decline in 2013 significantly."

So we don't have a facility-based TV product. But importantly, the wholesale revenues will continue to be a drag on the top line, and more so this year because of intercarrier compensation. While the net impact to OIBDA from intercarrier compensation is not that material, but you do have reductions to revenues and reductions to expenses. And that's really what's laying down our top line revenue growth. And not to be lost in the other service revenue bucket market that we now have out there, that's really represents the legacy PAETEC Cavalier consumers CLEC business, very low-margin business.

Also, with respect to the pension accounting change that you are making this year, could you talk about what impact that's going to have in terms of thinking about apples-and-apples comparisons year-over-year, although I think you did make that change in the pro formas. And then if I could -- just lastly, Jeff. Just -- could you elaborate a little bit on kind of how, with the increasing transition and focus on more of the CLEC and business services entity, you're thinking about management focus in the organization? How are you -- how would you address concerns that may exist in the market, that this was a well run world kind of consumer-focused business and now it's really trying to make this large leap into business services and it's a big change for management? How do you kind of address those concerns?"

I'll take your first questions, then I turn it over to Jeff. In terms of intercarrier comp, I would probably size that as roughly 30 to 40 basis points of pressure on the top line, obviously not nearly that significant, as I alluded to, on adjusted OIBDA because there's expense reductions. And in terms of USF, the big open item is the -- a $300 million fund that the FCC has established, that is meant to help deploy broadband in unserved parts of rural America. And right now, we're still waiting on the final rules to be developed, and it's important opportunity for us. We think Windstream is one of the carriers that's positioned to deliver broadband services to rural America. We have not specifically included anything in our guidance with respect to receiving any of the $300 million. There's some important aspects to it, including how much money you can spend per household in that investment. And we continue to work with the FCC to ensure we can capture as much of that money as possible, because we think we're in the best position to deliver those broadband services to rural America. And then in terms of the pension accounting change, I think as you alluded, we try to be very transparent in our investors supplement that we publish, and we actually have shown the pension expense separately for both cost of services and SG&A. So hopefully, that'll provide the transparency, if you need. But if not, please reach back out to Rob and I, and we can help  to clarify that."

And then just to add on the USF, I think that when you look at what Windstream's done in terms of getting to our rural customers today and how the FCC is thinking about this incremental $300 million, in our view, there's no better place to -- no company better prepared to use that money wisely and get the most bang for the buck. And so that's exactly what we're talking about with the FCC. There are net -- many parties involved in that. But as Tony said, there's nothing incremental, but we're optimistic that the goal of this was to reach more rural customers and we can help with that. So we're optimistic and up there working hard, helping them to better understand our network and what we can do with that money. You asked a great question, David, about one that get asked often, it's about how is this well-run rule ILEC going to perform as an enterprise carrier. And this has not been a gradual transition. In 2005, when we were -- we weren't even named Windstream, at the time, we were named Spinco, we were already contemplating a 5-year strategy to focus more on the enterprise space. So very tactically, over the last 5 years, we put people in place. On the sales side, we hired what I think is one of the most aggressive sales executives in the industry over 3 years ago to run our sales organization. You may recall that, 2 years ago, we bought NuVox. So we bought competitive LEC businesses before. We're in that business today. We've totally refocused our marketing, and it really goes across the whole organization on this enterprise focus. So I feel very well prepared. The last 3 months, the senior team here has been going around to the various markets talking to our sales team, and I'll tell you we've got a very professional sales force and a very unique selling proposition. And when you look at the products and services that we have and the work that our engineers have done to -- really to transform our network into a real enterprise capable network, there's really nothing that's biggest carriers in the country can offer that we can't today. So because of our experience, the fact that we've retained a lot of management -- if you look back from NuVox, several of their key executives are playing very prominent roles. The leader of the Hosted Solutions business continues to run our data center strategy. We kept 8 senior executives from PAETEC. So with every acquisition, we've supplemented that in -- with -- in improving our talent. And on the side, we've been improving our talent internally to prepare for this focus. So we've made many changes, and I feel very well prepared to meet the challenge of growing in the enterprise space."

And I think that's been demonstrated with our fiber-to-the-tower investments that we are willing to put our capital to work to generate these returns, and we think they're unique. Now we don't see anything right now in 2013 that changes this from our view, that we think the benchmark capital of 12% to 13% is appropriate. But if we identified opportunities I think you would expect that we increase the capital intensity, you should also expect us to increase the revenue adjusted OIBDA accordingly. But right now, our view is that we believe the 12% to 13% benchmark is about right."

PAETEC was a very important acquisition for us as it really -- it's brought us into position to sell multi-location. Brent talked about this in his remarks. We really feel like we have more -- we're more of a national player today, and we can go in and get the customers that previously we couldn't. And we really have assembled a set of assets. When you think about the cloud computing business and the fiber optic businesses that we have acquired, we do have a set of asset today that we believe we can grow. PAETEC deal positions Wind to grow in the business space and was an absolute great strategic fit. It was our largest acquisition. And in the near term, we are going to be very focused. And near term, I'm saying 9 to 12 months, on closing and integrating PAETEC. In the future, I will continue to be mindful of strategic opportunities that advance our capabilities in strategic growth areas. The game here has always been about -- the strategy has always been about positioning our business more for growth. We will set those within the framework of our plan, because this is also very important to us as well, to reduce our total leverage from current levels to our historical range of 3.2 to 3.4. So what that means in terms of acquisition criteria, when we look at transactions, we look for things that advance strategy to improve revenue trends. They're free cash flow accretive. They generate meaningful synergies, located in attractive markets with a favorable competitive position, great network assets and, importantly, maintain leverage in the same range or better. So this filter, obviously, reduces the number of deals that would be available to us, and as I said, that's very important to us. And we do feel like we do have a set of assets that we can grow going forward. So to summarize, as we think about the next 9 to 12 months, we're going to be very focused on integration of PAETEC, with -- which we've made great progress to-date on, and are very focused on getting a lot of that heavy lifting done in the next 12 months. And I would say, during that timeframe, additional transactions are unlikely."

Generally, we kind of call those spurs off of an existing fiber infrastructure in close proximity, and Tony kind of referenced the need to continue looking for success-based opportunity.

Today's conference call was preceded by our earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website.

Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
To assist investors, we have provided supplemental pro forma financial results to include the PAETEC business for all periods shown. Given that Windstream and PAETEC had different operating metric disclosures, we are currently developing a unified approach and plan to enhance our disclosures later this year. At this time, we've continued to provide the business operating metrics for legacy Windstream alone, and we have reclassified various integrated solution units to voice and high-speed Internet. 
Additionally, we have updated the pro forma schedules to reflect the impact of the voluntary change in accounting principle for recognizing the actuarial gains and losses within the pension plan. We've elected to reflect the change in actuarial gains and losses and operating results in the year in which they occur and not to smooth the effects over a longer period of time, in order to improve transparency by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on the plan. The historical pro forma results have been adjusted to reflect these changes. We will make references to these pro forma results, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call.

I'm going to make a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2012 guidance.
2011 was an incredibly successful year for Windstream. Throughout the year, we integrated several key acquisitions made in 2010, which truly enhanced our business strategy and expanded our suite of business offerings. In December, we add another key business to our portfolio with the acquisition of PAETEC, making Windstream a leader in providing communications and technology services nationwide. We also made many success-based capital investments that will enhance future growth, and we made significant improvements to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile. 
Our pro forma financial results for the year reflect our progress in transforming this business. Our $6.2 billion revenue stream declined 0.3% on a year-over-year basis, and we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.2%, a remarkable accomplishment. We have significantly improved the financial trajectory of Windstream and reached a significant milestone of growing pro forma revenue and adjusted OIBDA during the fourth quarter, giving us great momentum heading into 2012. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. We completed the acquisition of PAETEC. Now I'd like to, again, welcome the entire PAETEC team to Windstream. Together, we are a much stronger organization with more than 100,000 route miles of fiber, advanced enterprise-class data centers and an outstanding business sales team with a nationwide presence, all of which make Windstream a leader in the enterprise space, and I'm very excited about the opportunities ahead for our combined company. 
On the regulatory front, late last year, the SEC issued its plan to modernize federal intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. The plan was largely consistent with our expectations. We expect the financial impact to be manageable and believe the steps we have taken to diversify our revenue streams and focus on growth opportunities will help us navigate through this transition. 
As we look forward, we will be squarely focused on integrating the newly acquired PAETEC business and executing on our growth strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity to build on the momentum of 2011 and to leverage our expanded market presence and network to deliver advanced communications and technology solutions nationwide. We also have exciting prospects to continue investing for growth, including fiber-to-the-tower deployment, data center expansion and broadband stimulus projects, all of which offer attractive returns and improve Windstream's growth opportunities going forward. 
Over the past 6 years, we have pursued a path that we believe positions Windstream to be successful over the long run and allows us to maximize total shareholder returns. Through very targeted acquisitions and solid execution in our legacy business, we have indeed positioned Windstream for growth. Our goal has been and will continue to be achieving industry-leading shareholder returns, and our dividend has played a major role in our returns. 
That said, we are very committed to our dividend. And with a set of assets that we have assembled and our improving financial performance, Windstream is well positioned to easily maintain our dividend and consider other shareholder-friendly activities to enhance returns in the future.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

In the fourth quarter, business service revenue",662,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was another very productive and pivotal year for Windstream, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build upon the positive momentum we have coming into 2012. In the fourth quarter, business service revenues increased by 2.5% year-over-year driven by growth in our strategic services, including special access, integrated solutions and advanced data services. 
The sales team is doing a fantastic job selling our enhanced suite of business products, including data, voice, network and cloud services. With our acquisitions, we have created a robust platform of services and continue to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. The PAETEC acquisition expanded our footprint, which is now nationwide, allowing Windstream to better serve multi-location enterprise customers with advanced technology and communication needs. 
In the consumer channel, we saw nice improvements in operating trends here in the fourth quarter, driven by a successful cable switcher promotion. We added 8,000 high-speed Internet customers, growing our broadband customer base by 4% year-over-year. Consumer broadband revenues increased 7% year-over-year as a result of the growth in customers, combined with our success selling additional broadband services. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points. As we exit 2011, our consumer broadband penetration is 67% of primary lines, which positions us well to continue our focus on accelerating ARPU growth by selling incremental broadband services and faster speed. 
With respect to the PAETEC integration, we have completed the migration of the corporate systems, including the accounting, payroll and HR applications to the Windstream platform. We began operating as a combined sales team at the beginning of this year and are identifying the best practices within each organization to implement company-wide to ensure unified sales and marketing approach. PAETEC had a very similar product set and sales culture to Windstream, which has helped in our integration activities. I'm very pleased with our efforts to date, and we expect to realize approximately $50 million of synergies in 2012 and are right on track to achieve $100 million of synergies by 2014. 
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream's successful track record of delivering these services, we have had great success winning fiber-to-the-tower contracts from our wireless partners. During 2011, we spent approximately $130 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments, which are success based and secured with long-term contracts that provide attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. We also invested roughly $40 million in data center expansion and continued making investment to improve broadband capacity, given the demand for video over our network. In total, we completed roughly $30 million of broadband stimulus projects, of which Windstream's investment was $8 million. 
Looking forward, in the business channel, we are leveraging our expanded network and service offerings to drive new multi-location sales. In addition, we are focused on improving the cross-selling opportunities related to our cloud and managed services offerings to target existing customers and drive incremental ARPU. For the small business customers, we are focusing on aggressive bundling, up-selling Windstream services and improving retention. 
In the residential channel, we are rebranding our consumer high-speed Internet bundle to differentiate our offering and focus on consumers' changing video consumption patterns to over-the-top alternatives. Specifically, we will provide an integrated Internet and entertainment bundle that will leverage Internet services with the Roku box that aggregates various entertainment apps and enables customers to augment their pay TV experience with on-demand TV and movie options. 
As broadband penetration grows, we will focus on increasing the utility of our broadband connections to sell incremental services and applications and increase ARPU. In summary, we have exciting plans for both the business and consumer channels and very attractive investment opportunities in 2012, and I'm confident that these initiatives will continue advancing our growth strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."

For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash",1115,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash pension charge of $163 million or $103 million after tax, which we disclosed last month resulting from our pension accounting change. In addition, our GAAP results include approximately $23 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and an after-tax loss of roughly $7 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding all of these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19 for the fourth quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results for the fourth quarter. Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.75 billion, up 0.7% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased $21 million or 2.5%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.5%. Our wholesale revenues declined $2 million or almost 1%, and total product sales were up by $10 million or 17%. Within the business channel, data and integrated services grew by $25 million, driven by continued growth in IP next-gen data and data center services.  Carrier services, which is largely special access, was up $10 million year-over-year due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Business voice and long distance revenues declined by $15 million, related to migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $16 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $7 million. In the wholesale channel, voice and data revenues, which represent resale services within the former PAETEC business, declined by roughly $4 million due to usage declines. This was offset partially by slight increase in Switched Access, carrier settlements and the higher end USF and user surcharges. 
Product sales increased by $10 million, primarily related to increased business CPE and margin-neutral contractor sales. Cash expenses increased $8 million year-over-year or 0.9%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $13 million due largely to higher interconnect costs, bad debt expense and higher salaries. Cost of products sold increased by $10 million as a result of higher product sales, and SG&A expenses decreased $15 million due to incremental deal synergies. For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $612 million, an increase of 0.4% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. 
Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. Windstream generated total revenues of $6.2 billion, a decrease of 0.3% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $2.4 billion, which represented 1.2% growth year-over-year, resulting from the realization of deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $892 million. On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $784 million in 2011, a decrease of roughly 4% year-over-year, driven by higher capital expenditures and incremental interest related to PAETEC debt, which was partially offset by higher adjusted OIBDA and a net cash tax refund of $11 million. 
In terms of heritage Windstream 2011 results, I am very pleased with the significant improvements we achieved in our overall revenue trends. During the fourth quarter, heritage revenues declined by roughly $1 million year-over-year, and thus, we were very close to achieving our goal of growing the top line as we exited the year. For the full year, we met the guidance ranges for revenue, OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA. Free cash flow was below the range provided due to the acceleration of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
From a balance sheet perspective, 2011 was a very productive year. We refinanced over $2 billion in higher coupon debt and expanded our revolving line of credit, allowing us to significantly lower cash interest expense in the future. We ended the year with net leverage of 3.67x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to deleveraging back to our historic range of 3.2x to 3.4x and plan to achieve this through debt reduction and adjusted OIBDA growth. 
Since the first of the year, we have refinanced $300 million of PAETEC 2015 notes and recently launched an amendment to our credit facility that will extend a large portion of our term loan A maturity to 2016 and, at the same time, allow us to raise $280 million in additional term loan A proceeds that will be used to partially pay down our revolving line of credit, creating future refinancing capacity. In addition, we recently received FCC approval related to 2 spectrum sales and, as a result, expect $55 million of proceeds by the end of the first quarter, which will finance the $55 million in integrating -- integration capital that we expect to spend in 2012. 
Turning to 2012, let me now discuss our guidance for the year. We expect revenue to be within a range of $6.18 billion to $6.305 billion. We expected adjusted OIBDA to be within the range of $2.43 billion to $2.5 billion. Given the timing of our expected synergies and the delayed start to the intercarrier compensation recovery mechanism, it is our expectation that we will show continued improvement in adjusted OIBDA throughout the year, or said differently, our year-over-year performance should improve as we move through the year. 
We expect to spend between $950 million and $1.05 billion of capital expenditures, which excludes the integration capital of $55 million I mentioned previously. Our CapEx guidance range includes over $200 million in fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $45 million related to Windstream's portion of the broadband stimulus projects. We expect a cash tax refund of around $91 million, which reflects the benefit of 50% accelerated appreciation for capital investments and other tax savings initiatives we implemented last year. 
Our guidance also assumes net cash interest of $659 million, which includes a $29 million December 31, 2011, interest payment that was made in the calendar year 2012. Even with this extra interest payment and excluding the integration capital I just mentioned, we expect to generate between $840 million to $950 million in adjusted free cash flow or an expected dividend payout ratio of 62% to 70%. 
Looking beyond 2012 from a free cash flow perspective, we are more confident than ever in our ability to continue achieving growth in adjusted OIBDA. This growth, along with significant reductions in capital spending and further declines in cash interest will position us well to easily maintain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future, even with the expectation of cash taxes increasing. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Ali, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

I'll get us started here and Brent and Jeff can add in as they wish. But when you look at our capital guidance for 2012 of $950 million to the $1.05 billion, as I mentioned, we've included over $200 million in investments in fiber-to-the-tower and that compares with roughly a little over $100 million in 2011. And as you look forward, we expect to see significant reductions in that fiber-to-the-tower investment. We've talked about this a lot, but this is kind of a land grab that's been going on for the last 2 years, and we expect that fiber-to-the-tower investment to taper down materially in 2013 and almost be fully wrapped up by 2014. In addition, the other big item we talked about was broadband stimulus, expecting to invest approximately $45 million in 2012. We invested approximately $8 million in 2011, and there might be a few remnants of spend in 2013 related to the stimulus projects. They'll be very immaterial. And then beyond that for our data center investment, we've invested approximately $40 million in 2011, and we do expect to spend some dollars in 2012, probably not quite up to $40 million, as we look at other options to potentially obtain data center space, not to mention the fact that PAETEC gave us a nice set of data center assets that we think we can leverage and be successful with the market. So we don't feel the need to put our capital to work necessarily in 2013 associated with data center space. And then we really don't give a lot of color between consumer and enterprise. But I would tell you that we continue to make significant investments in the consumer broadband business. Brent alluded to this in his remarks. As over-the-top video continues to play a more important part in our broadband service, we continue to invest to support that. Last year, we rolled out a technology that enabled higher speeds in our markets of roughly $40 million dedicated to that effort. We sometimes we refer to that technology as VDSL. And we invested approximately $80 million in strengthening our broadband consumer network in 2011, and we expect to spend at least that much in 2012. And the VDSL monies, we do not necessarily expect to repeat in 2012, but really just the ongoing support and maintenance of our consumer broadband business."

And who -- are you out there competing with AT&T and Verizon on these, now that you have a more of a national footprint, or is it more on the CLEC side? And then I guess if I could just piggyback off of the last question, maybe look a little bit further out because I think the details you guys gave for '12 is really good. But as you think about the asset mix that you have in place now and the customers that you're going after, what do you think may be a reasonable long-term capital intensity of this business now?"

I'll take the first part of your question. In terms of the type of customers we're going for and what we're selling, I mean, a lot of what we're selling is really kind of VoIP product, MPLS product, allowing customers to really buy a data pipe that meets their needs and manage their voice and data traffic. Kind of growing momentum in the marketplace in terms of need for incremental bandwidth is helping. But I'll tell you what PAETEC also afforded us is a much broader kind of nationwide platform. And one of the things we talked about really focusing on is multi-location customers. That yes, we can compete with an AT&T and Verizon, but I'll tell you, our typical size is more in the $2,000 to $10,000 range, is more on average what the type of deals we're doing from a monthly recurring revenue standpoint. And that's not really a sweet spot where those folks can focus in terms of with the personalized service aspect that's a hallmark of the way we're approaching the marketplace. So that's really how we're focusing on the business side, and I think we're having a lot of success. We just changed our business tagline, kind of heading into 2012 as a result of PAETEC acquisition, focused on smart solutions and personalized service. And we think those 2 things can really help us with a lot of success in the marketplace, and we're seeing that really growing right now. And that's showing up, as you saw, in our financial results."

That is complementary to a very aggressive sales team that we inherited from NuVox and complementary to our own internal refocus. So our sales team is very well positioned for this personal service approach. And as you think about our footprint, Scott, and the competitive opportunity, there's many, many markets where there -- that's ripe with opportunity, where we have relatively low share. So we're really bullish on what PAETEC and our other acquisitions have done. When you think about Windstream, now in a position to provide great data services, voice services that customers will always need with the network, with our fiber optic asset, in the cloud with our hosted solution asset. So we've never felt better about our ability to sell in those competitive markets. And on capital intensity, again, what we expect in 2013, and Tony can add some detail to this if he'd like, but in 2013, if you back out the decrease that Tony mentioned earlier as it relates to our fiber-to-the-tower initiative, which will be down significantly, and the fact that we're going to be essentially done with our stimulus spending, we expect our capital intensity to kind of revert back to kind of our normalized intensity in this business. And so I don't think PAETEC changed that dramatically at all. As we look at it, we've made great progress. Our network is much more robust today. We're anxious to win business. We will make success-based capital investments, but we do fully expect that capital intensity to decline in 2013 significantly."

And we think our consumer revenue performance of declines of 2.5% are very, very solid, especially when you consider leveraging a DISH relationship from a TV perspective. So we don't have a facility-based TV product. But importantly, the wholesale revenues will continue to be a drag on the top line, and more so this year because of intercarrier compensation. While the net impact to OIBDA from intercarrier compensation is not that material, but you do have reductions to revenues and reductions to expenses. And that's really what's weighing down our top line revenue growth. And not to be lost in the other service revenue buckets that we now have out there, that really represents the legacy PAETEC Cavalier consumer CLEC business, very low-margin business. We decided to no longer be -- actively sell into that market. And we expect to see that business to trip off over a number of years and see revenue declines at roughly 20%, but importantly, not a lot of impact to OIBDA."

And right now, we're still waiting on the final rules to be developed, and it's an important opportunity for us. We think Windstream is one of the carriers that's positioned to deliver broadband services to rural America. We have not specifically included anything in our guidance with respect to receiving any of the $300 million. There are some important aspects to it, including how much money you can spend per household in that investment. And we continue to work with the FCC to ensure we can capture as much of that money as possible, because we think we're in the best position to deliver those broadband services to rural America.

And so that's exactly what we're talking about with the FCC. There are net -- many parties involved in that. But as Tony said, there's nothing incremental, but we're optimistic that the goal of this was to reach more rural customers and we can help with that. So we're optimistic and up there working hard, helping them to better understand our network and what we can do with that money. You asked a great question, David, about -- one that got asked often, it's about how is this well-run rural ILEC going to perform as an enterprise carrier. And this has not been a gradual transition. In 2005, when we were -- we weren't even named Windstream at the time, we were named Spinco, we were already contemplating a 5-year strategy to focus more on the enterprise space. So very tactically, over the last 5 years, we've put people in place. On the sales side, we hired what I think is one of the most aggressive sales executives in the industry over 3 years ago to run our sales organization. You may recall that, 2 years ago, we bought NuVox. So we bought competitive LEC businesses before. We're in that business today. We've totally refocused our marketing, and it really goes across the whole organization on this enterprise focus. So I feel very well prepared. The last 3 months, the senior team here has been going around to the various markets talking to our sales teams, and I'll tell you, we've got a very professional sales force and a very unique selling proposition. And when you look at the products and services that we have and the work that our engineers have done to really to transform our network into a real enterprise capable network, there's really nothing the biggest carriers in the country can offer that we can't today. So because of our experience, the fact that we've retained a lot of management, if you look back for NuVox, several of their key executives are playing very prominent roles. The leader of the Hosted Solutions business continues to run our data center strategy. We kept 8 senior executives from PAETEC. So with every acquisition, we've supplemented that in -- with -- in improving our talent. And on the side, we've been improving our talent internally to prepare for this focus. So we've made many changes, and I feel very well prepared to meet the challenge of growing in the enterprise space."

Now we don't see anything right now in 2013 that changes this from our view, that we think the benchmark capital of 12% to 13% is appropriate. But if we identified opportunities, I think you would expect if we increase the capital intensity, you should also expect us to increase the revenue adjusted OIBDA accordingly.

PAETEC was a very important acquisition for us as it really, it dropped us into a position to sell multi-location. Brent talked about this in his remarks. We really feel like we have more -- we're more of a national player today, and we can go in and get to customers that previously we couldn't. And we really have assembled a set of assets. When you think about the cloud computing business and the fiber optic businesses that we have acquired, we do have a set of assets today that we believe we can grow. PAETEC deal positions Wind to grow in the business space and was an absolute great strategic fit. It was our largest acquisition. And in the near term, we are going to be very focused. And near term, I'm saying 9 to 12 months, on closing and integrating PAETEC. In the future, we'll continue to be mindful of strategic opportunities that advance our capabilities in strategic growth areas. The game here has always been about -- the strategy has always been about positioning our business more for growth. We will assess those within the framework of our plan, because this is also very important to us as well, to reduce our total leverage from current levels to our historical range of 3.2 to 3.4. So what that means in terms of acquisition criteria, when we look at transactions, we look for things that advance strategy, improve revenue trends. They're free cash flow accretive. They generate meaningful synergies, located in attractive markets with a favorable competitive position, great network assets and, importantly, maintain leverage in the same range or better. So this filter, obviously, reduces the number of deals that would be available to us, and as I said, that's very important to us. And we do feel like we do have a set of assets that we can grow going forward. So to summarize, as we think about the next 9 to 12 months, we're going to be very focused on integration of PAETEC, with -- which we've made great progress to-date on, and are very focused on getting a lot of that heavy lifting done in the next 12 months. And I would say, during that timeframe, additional transactions are unlikely."

That's really where our focus resides in 2012. Outside of that, where we'll extend the network is on success-based initiatives, where our business team has a great opportunity to go into a large account and provide our own network. Generally, we kind of call those spurs off of an existing fiber infrastructure in close proximity, and Tony kind of referenced the need to continue looking for success-based opportunities. That's the kind of stuff our business team is working to find in the marketplace, and that's really where I see the bulk of our footprint extensions occurring beyond fiber-to-the-tower in both 2012 and then continued focus on that, honestly, in 2013 to beyond.

We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Windstream's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Results. Today's conference call was preceded by our earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
To assist investors, we have provided supplemental pro forma financial results to include the PAETEC business for all periods shown. Given that Windstream and PAETEC had different operating metric disclosures, we are currently developing a unified approach and plan to enhance our disclosures later this year. At this time, we've continued to provide the business operating metrics for legacy Windstream alone, and we have reclassified various integrated solution units to voice and high-speed Internet. 
Additionally, we have updated the pro forma schedules to reflect the impact of the voluntary change in accounting principle for recognizing the actuarial gains and losses within the pension plan. We've elected to reflect the change in actuarial gains and losses and operating results in the year in which they occur and not to smooth the effects over a longer period of time, in order to improve transparency by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on the plan. The historical pro forma results have been adjusted to reflect these changes. We will make references to these pro forma results, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. 
Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions.

I'm going to make a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance and 2012 guidance.
2011 was an incredibly successful year for Windstream. Throughout the year, we integrated several key acquisitions made in 2010, which truly enhanced our business strategy and expanded our suite of business offerings. In December, we add another key business to our portfolio with the acquisition of PAETEC, making Windstream a leader in providing communications and technology services nationwide. We also made many success-based capital investments that will enhance future growth, and we made significant improvements to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile. 
Our pro forma financial results for the year reflect our progress in transforming this business. Our $6.2 billion revenue stream declined 0.3% on a year-over-year basis, and we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.2%, a remarkable accomplishment. We have significantly improved the financial trajectory of Windstream and reached a significant milestone of growing pro forma revenue and adjusted OIBDA during the fourth quarter, giving us great momentum heading into 2012. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives. We completed the acquisition of PAETEC. Now I'd like to, again, welcome the entire PAETEC team to Windstream. Together, we are a much stronger organization with more than 100,000 route miles of fiber, advanced enterprise-class data centers and an outstanding business sales team with a nationwide presence, all of which make Windstream a leader in the enterprise space, and I'm very excited about the opportunities ahead for our combined company. 
On the regulatory front, late last year, the SEC issued its plan to modernize federal intercarrier compensation and universal service policies. The plan was largely consistent with our expectations. We expect the financial impact to be manageable and believe the steps we have taken to diversify our revenue streams and focus on growth opportunities will help us navigate through this transition. 
As we look forward, we will be squarely focused on integrating the newly acquired PAETEC business and executing on our growth strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity to build on the momentum of 2011 and to leverage our expanded market presence and network to deliver advanced communications and technology solutions nationwide. We also have exciting prospects to continue investing for growth, including fiber-to-the-tower deployment, data center expansion and broadband stimulus projects, all of which offer attractive returns and improve Windstream's growth opportunities going forward. 
Over the past 6 years, we have pursued a path that we believe positions Windstream to be successful over the long run and allows us to maximize total shareholder returns. Through very targeted acquisitions and solid execution in our legacy business, we have indeed positioned Windstream for growth. Our goal has been and will continue to be achieving industry-leading shareholder returns, and our dividend has played a major role in our returns. 
That said, we are very committed to our dividend. And with a set of assets that we have assembled and our improving financial performance, Windstream is well positioned to easily maintain our dividend and consider other shareholder-friendly activities to enhance returns in the future.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."

In the fourth quarter, business service revenues increased by 2.5% year-over-year driven by growth in our strategic services, including special access, integrated solutions and advanced data services. 
The sales team is doing a fantastic job selling our enhanced suite of business products, including data, voice, network and cloud services. With our acquisitions, we have created a robust platform of services and continue to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise space. The PAETEC acquisition expanded our footprint, which is now nationwide, allowing Windstream to better serve multi-location enterprise customers with advanced technology and communication needs. 
In the consumer channel, we saw nice improvements in operating trends here in the fourth quarter, driven by a successful cable switcher promotion. We added 8,000 high-speed Internet customers, growing our broadband customer base by 4% year-over-year. Consumer broadband revenues increased 7% year-over-year as a result of the growth in customers, combined with our success selling additional broadband services. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points. As we exit 2011, our consumer broadband penetration is 67% of primary lines, which positions us well to continue our focus on accelerating ARPU growth by selling incremental broadband services and faster speed. 
With respect to the PAETEC integration, we have completed the migration of the corporate systems, including the accounting, payroll and HR applications to the Windstream platform. We began operating as a combined sales team at the beginning of this year and are identifying the best practices within each organization to implement company-wide to ensure unified sales and marketing approach. PAETEC had a very similar product set and sales culture to Windstream, which has helped in our integration activities. I'm very pleased with our efforts to date, and we expect to realize approximately $50 million of synergies in 2012 and are right on track to achieve $100 million of synergies by 2014. 
As Jeff mentioned, we have made tremendous progress on our capital initiatives this year. Given the demand for wireless backhaul and Windstream's successful track record of delivering these services, we have had great success winning fiber-to-the-tower contracts from our wireless partners. During 2011, we spent approximately $130 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments, which are success based and secured with long-term contracts that provide attractive returns in excess of our cost of capital. We also invested roughly $40 million in data center expansion and continued making investment to improve broadband capacity, given the demand for video over our network. In total, we completed roughly $30 million of broadband stimulus projects, of which Windstream's investment was $8 million. 
Looking forward, in the business channel, we are leveraging our expanded network and service offerings to drive new multi-location sales. In addition, we are focused on improving the cross-selling opportunities related to our cloud and managed services offerings to target existing customers and drive incremental ARPU. For the small business customers, we are focusing on aggressive bundling, up-selling Windstream services and improving retention. 
In the residential channel, we are rebranding our consumer high-speed Internet bundle to differentiate our offering and focus on consumers' changing video consumption patterns to over-the-top alternatives. Specifically, we will provide an integrated Internet and entertainment bundle that will leverage Internet services with the Roku box that aggregates various entertainment apps and enables customers to augment their pay TV experience with on-demand TV and movie options. 
As broadband penetration grows, we will focus on increasing the utility of our broadband connections to sell incremental services and applications and increase ARPU. In summary, we have exciting plans for both the business and consumer channels and very attractive investment opportunities in 2012, and I'm confident that these initiatives will continue advancing our growth strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."

For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $1.21 billion, operating income of $100 million and a net loss of $0.06 per share. Our GAAP results include a pretax noncash pension charge of $163 million or $103 million after tax, which we disclosed last month resulting from our pension accounting change. In addition, our GAAP results include approximately $23 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and an after-tax loss of roughly $7 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding all of these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.19 for the fourth quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results for the fourth quarter. Windstream achieved total revenues of $1.75 billion, up 0.7% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased $21 million or 2.5%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.5%. Our wholesale revenues declined $2 million or almost 1%, and total product sales were up by $10 million or 17%. Within the business channel, data and integrated services grew by $25 million, driven by continued growth in IP next-gen data and data center services.  Carrier services, which is largely special access, was up $10 million year-over-year due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Business voice and long distance revenues declined by $15 million, related to migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $16 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $7 million. In the wholesale channel, voice and data revenues, which represent resale services within the former PAETEC business, declined by roughly $4 million due to usage declines. This was offset partially by slight increase in Switched Access, carrier settlements and the higher end USF and user surcharges. 
Product sales increased by $10 million, primarily related to increased business CPE and margin-neutral contractor sales. Cash expenses increased $8 million year-over-year or 0.9%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $13 million due largely to higher interconnect costs, bad debt expense and higher salaries. Cost of products sold increased by $10 million as a result of higher product sales, and SG&A expenses decreased $15 million due to incremental deal synergies. For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $612 million, an increase of 0.4% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. 
Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. Windstream generated total revenues of $6.2 billion, a decrease of 0.3% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA was $2.4 billion, which represented 1.2% growth year-over-year, resulting from the realization of deal synergies and solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, capital expenditures totaled $892 million. On a GAAP basis, adjusted free cash flow was $784 million in 2011, a decrease of roughly 4% year-over-year, driven by higher capital expenditures and incremental interest related to PAETEC debt, which was partially offset by higher adjusted OIBDA and a net cash tax refund of $11 million. 
In terms of heritage Windstream 2011 results, I am very pleased with the significant improvements we achieved in our overall revenue trends. During the fourth quarter, heritage revenues declined by roughly $1 million year-over-year, and thus, we were very close to achieving our goal of growing the top line as we exited the year. For the full year, we met the guidance ranges for revenue, OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA. Free cash flow was below the range provided due to the acceleration of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. 
From a balance sheet perspective, 2011 was a very productive year. We refinanced over $2 billion in higher coupon debt and expanded our revolving line of credit, allowing us to significantly lower cash interest expense in the future. We ended the year with net leverage of 3.67x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to deleveraging back to our historic range of 3.2 to 3.4x and plan to achieve this through debt reduction and adjusted OIBDA growth. 
Since the first of the year, we have refinanced $300 million of PAETEC 2015 notes and recently launched an amendment to our credit facility that will extend a large portion of our term loan A maturity to 2016 and, at the same time, allow us to raise $280 million in additional term loan A proceeds that will be used to partially pay down our revolving line of credit, creating future refinancing capacity. In addition, we recently received FCC approval related to 2 spectrum sales and, as a result, expect $55 million of proceeds by the end of the first quarter, which will finance the $55 million in integrating -- integration capital that we expect to spend in 2012. 
Turning to 2012, let me now discuss our guidance for the year. We expect revenue to be within a range of $6.18 billion to $6.305 billion. We expected adjusted OIBDA to be within the range of $2.43 billion to $2.5 billion. Given the timing of our expected synergies and the delayed start to the intercarrier compensation recovery mechanism, it is our expectation that we will show continued improvement in adjusted OIBDA throughout the year, or said differently, our year-over-year performance should improve as we move through the year. 
We expect to spend between $950 million and $1.05 billion of capital expenditures, which excludes the integration capital of $55 million I mentioned previously. Our CapEx guidance range includes over $200 million in fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $45 million related to Windstream's portion of the broadband stimulus projects. We expect a cash tax refund of around $91 million, which reflects the benefit of 50% accelerated appreciation for capital investments and other tax savings initiatives we implemented last year. 
Our guidance also assumes net cash interest of $659 million, which includes a $29 million December 31, 2011, interest payment that was made in the calendar year 2012. Even with this extra interest payment and excluding the integration capital I just mentioned, we expect to generate between $840 million to $950 million in adjusted free cash flow or an expected dividend payout ratio of 62% to 70%. 
Looking beyond 2012 from a free cash flow perspective, we are more confident than ever in our ability to continue achieving growth in adjusted OIBDA. This growth, along with significant reductions in capital spending and further declines in cash interest will position us well to easily maintain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future, even with the expectation of cash taxes increasing. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Ali, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

I'll get us started here and Brent and Jeff can add in as they wish. But when you look at our capital guidance for 2012 of $950 million to the $1.05 billion, as I mentioned, we've included over $200 million in investments in fiber-to-the-tower and that compares with roughly a little over $100 million in 2011. And as you look forward, we expect to see significant reductions in that fiber-to-the-tower investment. We've talked about this a lot, but this is kind of a land grab that's been going on for the last 2 years, and we expect that fiber-to-the-tower investment to taper down materially in 2013 and almost be fully wrapped up by 2014. In addition, the other big item we talked about was broadband stimulus, expecting to invest approximately $45 million in 2012. We invested approximately $8 million in 2011, and there might be a few remnants of spend in 2013 related to the stimulus projects. They'll be very immaterial. And then beyond that for our data center investment, we've invested approximately $40 million in 2011, and we do expect to spend some dollars in 2012, probably not quite up to $40 million, as we look at other options to potentially obtain data center space, not to mention the fact that PAETEC gave us a nice set of data center assets that we think we can leverage and be successful with the market. So we don't feel the need to put our capital to work necessarily in 2013 associated with data center space. And then we really don't give a lot of color between consumer and enterprise. But I would tell you that we continue to make significant investments in the consumer broadband business. Brent alluded to this in his remarks. As over-the-top video continues to play a more important part in our broadband service, we continue to invest to support that. Last year, we rolled out a technology that enabled higher speeds in our markets of roughly $40 million dedicated to that effort. We sometimes we refer to that technology as VDSL. And we invested approximately $80 million in strengthening our broadband consumer network in 2011, and we expect to spend at least that much in 2012. And the VDSL monies, we do not necessarily expect to repeat in 2012, but really just the ongoing support and maintenance of our consumer broadband business. Does that help, Michael?"

And who -- are you out there competing with AT&T and Verizon on these, now that you have a more of a national footprint, or is it more on the CLEC side? And then I guess if I could just piggyback off of the last question, maybe look a little bit further out because I think the details you guys gave for '12 is really good. But as you think about the asset mix that you have in place now and the customers that you're going after, what do you think may be a reasonable long-term capital intensity of this business now?"

In terms of the type of customers we're going for and what we're selling, I mean, a lot of what we're selling is really kind of VoIP product, MPLS product, allowing customers to really buy a data pipe that meets their needs and manage their voice and data traffic. Kind of growing momentum in the marketplace in terms of need for incremental bandwidth is helping. But I'll tell you what PAETEC also afforded us is a much broader kind of nationwide platform. And one of the things we talked about really focusing on is multi-location customers. That yes, we can compete with an AT&T and Verizon, but I'll tell you, our typical size is more in the $2,000 to $10,000 range, is more on average what the type of deals we're doing from a monthly recurring revenue standpoint. And that's not really a sweet spot where those folks can focus in terms of with the personalized service aspect that's a hallmark of the way we're approaching the marketplace. So that's really how we're focusing on the business side, and I think we're having a lot of success. We just changed our business tagline, kind of heading into 2012 as a result of PAETEC acquisition, focused on smart solutions and personalized service. And we think those 2 things can really help us with a lot of success in the marketplace, and we're seeing that really growing right now. And that's showing up, as you saw, in our financial results."

That is complementary to a very aggressive sales team that we inherited from NuVox and complementary to our own internal refocus. So our sales team is very well positioned for this personal service approach. And as you think about our footprint, Scott, and the competitive opportunity, there's many, many markets where there -- that's ripe with opportunity, where we have relatively low share. So we're really bullish on what PAETEC and our other acquisitions have done. When you think about Windstream, now in a position to provide great data services, voice services that customers will always need with the network, with our fiber optic asset, in the cloud with our hosted solution asset. So we've never felt better about our ability to sell in those competitive markets. And on capital intensity, again, what we expect in 2013, and Tony can add some detail to this if he'd like, but in 2013, if you back out the decrease that Tony mentioned earlier as it relates to our fiber-to-the-tower initiative, which will be down significantly, and the fact that we're going to be essentially done with our stimulus spending, we expect our capital intensity to kind of revert back to kind of our normalized intensity in this business. And so I don't think PAETEC changed that dramatically at all. As we look at it, we've made great progress. Our network is much more robust today. We're anxious to win business. We will make success-based capital investments, but we do fully expect that capital intensity to decline in 2013 significantly."

And we think our consumer revenue performance of declines of 2.5% are very, very solid, especially when you consider leveraging a DISH relationship from a TV perspective. So we don't have a facility-based TV product. But importantly, the wholesale revenues will continue to be a drag on the top line, and more so this year because of intercarrier compensation. While the net impact to OIBDA from intercarrier compensation is not that material, but you do have reductions to revenues and reductions to expenses. And that's really what's weighing down our top line revenue growth. And not to be lost in the other service revenue buckets that we now have out there, that really represents the legacy PAETEC Cavalier consumer CLEC business, very low-margin business. We decided to no longer be -- actively sell into that market. And we expect to see that business to trip off over a number of years and see revenue declines at roughly 20%, but importantly, not a lot of impact to OIBDA."

And right now, we're still waiting on the final rules to be developed, and it's an important opportunity for us. We think Windstream is one of the carriers that's positioned to deliver broadband services to rural America. We have not specifically included anything in our guidance with respect to receiving any of the $300 million. There are some important aspects to it, including how much money you can spend per household in that investment. And we continue to work with the FCC to ensure we can capture as much of that money as possible, because we think we're in the best position to deliver those broadband services to rural America. And then in terms of the pension accounting change, I think as you alluded, we try to be very transparent in our investor supplement that we publish, and we actually have shown the pension expense separately for both cost of services and SG&A.

But as Tony said, there's nothing incremental, but we're optimistic that the goal of this was to reach more rural customers and we can help with that. So we're optimistic and up there working hard, helping them to better understand our network and what we can do with that money. You asked a great question, David, about -- one that got asked often, it's about how is this well-run rural ILEC going to perform as an enterprise carrier. And this has not been a gradual transition. In 2005, when we were -- we weren't even named Windstream at the time, we were named Spinco, we were already contemplating a 5-year strategy to focus more on the enterprise space. So very tactically, over the last 5 years, we've put people in place. On the sales side, we hired what I think is one of the most aggressive sales executives in the industry over 3 years ago to run our sales organization. You may recall that, 2 years ago, we bought NuVox. So we bought competitive LEC businesses before. We're in that business today. We've totally refocused our marketing, and it really goes across the whole organization on this enterprise focus. So I feel very well prepared. The last 3 months, the senior team here has been going around to the various markets talking to our sales teams, and I'll tell you, we've got a very professional sales force and a very unique selling proposition. And when you look at the products and services that we have and the work that our engineers have done to really to transform our network into a real enterprise capable network, there's really nothing the biggest carriers in the country can offer that we can't today. So because of our experience, the fact that we've retained a lot of management, if you look back for NuVox, several of their key executives are playing very prominent roles. The leader of the Hosted Solutions business continues to run our data center strategy. We kept 8 senior executives from PAETEC. So with every acquisition, we've supplemented that in -- with -- in improving our talent. And on the side, we've been improving our talent internally to prepare for this focus. So we've made many changes, and I feel very well prepared to meet the challenge of growing in the enterprise space."

But I would also tell you that we were also mindful of using our capital to generate revenue. I think most importantly to our investors is we want to make sure if we invest capital, we're getting returns well in excess of our cost of capital. And I think that's been demonstrated with our fiber-to-the-tower investments that we are willing to put our capital to work to generate these returns, and we think they're unique. Now we don't see anything right now in 2013 that changes this from our view, that we think the benchmark capital of 12% to 13% is appropriate. But if we identified opportunities, I think you would expect if we increase the capital intensity, you should also expect us to increase the revenue adjusted OIBDA accordingly. But right now, our view is that we believe the 12% to 13% benchmark is about right."

PAETEC was a very important acquisition for us as it really, it’s brought us into a position to sell multi-location. Brent talked about this in his remarks. We really feel like we have more -- we're more of a national player today, and we can go in and get to customers that previously we couldn't. And we really have assembled a set of assets. When you think about the cloud computing business and the fiber optic businesses that we have acquired, we do have a set of assets today that we believe we can grow. PAETEC deal positions Wind to grow in the business space and was an absolute great strategic fit. It was our largest acquisition. And in the near term, we are going to be very focused. And near term, I'm saying 9 to 12 months, on closing and integrating PAETEC. In the future, we'll continue to be mindful of strategic opportunities that advance our capabilities in strategic growth areas. The game here has always been about -- the strategy has always been about positioning our business more for growth. We will assess those within the framework of our plan, because this is also very important to us as well, to reduce our total leverage from current levels to our historical range of 3.2 to 3.4. So what that means in terms of acquisition criteria, when we look at transactions, we look for things that advance strategy, improve revenue trends. They're free cash flow accretive. They generate meaningful synergies, located in attractive markets with a favorable competitive position, great network assets and, importantly, maintain leverage in the same range or better. So this filter, obviously, reduces the number of deals that would be available to us, and as I said, that's very important to us. And we do feel like we do have a set of assets that we can grow going forward. So to summarize, as we think about the next 9 to 12 months, we're going to be very focused on integration of PAETEC, with -- which we've made great progress to-date on, and are very focused on getting a lot of that heavy lifting done in the next 12 months. And I would say, during that timeframe, additional transactions are unlikely."

I will begin be making a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
Turning to Slide 4, I am credibly pleased with the outstanding performance in our core business. The business channel has gained significant traction with the acquisition of PAETEC, and our combined team is having tremendous success driving new sales opportunities. Business service revenue, which is our most important strategic growth area grew 3.2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, an acceleration of 80 basis points sequentially. These outstanding results are a testament to the entire business sales team and to the value proposition Windstream offers business customers. 
The consumer channel also had a very solid quarter driven by 5.9% year-over-year growth in broadband service revenues and continued success with our bundling strategy. Our wholesale revenue declined more than we expected due largely to our decision to suspend and modify certain wholesale products that were a part of the PAETEC portfolio, which Tony will discuss in more detail.
Turning to our strategic initiatives. I'm very pleased with how quickly the PAETEC team has assimilated into Windstream. The acquisition brought tremendous enterprise-level expertise and product offerings which has strengthened Windstream's already robust business division. We now have a nationwide fiber network capable of delivering advanced communications solutions to multi-location enterprises, which has opened many new doors. In fact, we are already seeing increased sales opportunity as a result of our enhanced capabilities and national footprint, and we're executing on our plan to offer smart solutions with personalized service, which we believe is a brand attribute that improves our competitive position. 
On the regulatory front, the SEC is conducting a process to develop and adopt final rules for universal service funding which will be based on forward-looking cost models to expand broadband to high-cost areas. The initial November 2011 order provided for $300 million of interim support to price cap carriers to deploy broadband to unserved locations. Windstream is eligible for up to $60 million of this incremental support. Although we are not certain at this time how much we can accept under the SEC's requirements, we will continue our analysis over the next few months with the goal of accepting the maximum amount that meets our investment criteria. 
As we look forward, I'm extremely confident in the business that we have built. Through targeted acquisitions and our strategic growth initiatives, we have assembled an attractive set of assets capable of generating consistent cash flows over time. I am very encouraged with the longer-term prospects given the accelerated growth rates in our business channel and the continued stability in our consumer business. 2012 is all about execution, integrating PAETEC and positioning this business for long-term success. As I have said before, our goal is to deliver consistent industry-leading shareholder returns, and our strategy will allow us to support our dividend over a long period of time and provide other opportunities in the future to increase shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent who will discuss our operating results."

Let me begin with an overview of the business channel on Slide 8. In the first quarter, pro forma business service revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year, representing a very nice acceleration in the growth rate both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our success in selling strategic business services. 
Business data and integrated services increased $29 million or 8.4% year-over-year. Our result of strong growth in our VoIP and data bundles, data center services and next-generation data. In addition, we are seeing increased demand for data center co-location, cloud and managed services, which combined with our voice and data services, provide complete solutions for our business customers. 
Carrier revenue increased $9 million year-over-year or 6.2% driven by continued demand for additional circuits to meet growing bandwidth needs. Sequentially, carrier revenue was flat as carriers' demand for new TDM circuits slowed in advance of the transition to fiber. Importantly, we have a very robust funnel for fiber circuits, both ILEC and non-ILEC territory, which we expect to be reflected in revenues throughout the year as we complete this fiber builds. 
For the sites we have placed in service, we are already seeing demand for additional bandwidth resulting in incremental revenue as the circuits are priced on a per meg basis. Business product sales was down $7 million year-over-year or 16%, but we do expect these revenues to improve in the second quarter and remainder of the year as we've been successful selling equipment to many large business customers, and we are gaining nice momentum in this group. 
Turning to the consumer channel on Slide 9. We saw continued stabilization in the overall trends as growth for broadband services offset some of the pressure from voice declines. We added 7,500 residential high-speed Internet customers growing our broadband customer base by 2.4% year-over-year, while consumer broadband revenues grew 5.9%. Our consumer broadband penetration is now at 68% of primary residential lines, positioning us very well as we place more emphasis on growing ARPU by selling faster Internet speeds and value-added broadband features and services. 
During the quarter, we rebranded our consumer offerings to provide an integrated high-speed Internet and entertainment bundle that leverages our Internet services with the Roku box that aggregates numerous entertainment apps allowing customers to enhance their pay TV experience. Although still early, we've been encouraged with the initial results, which is driving better customer ARPU due to the higher price point and increased sales of faster broadband speeds. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our team is doing a great job integrating PAETEC on an aggressive timeline. We've integrated virtually every functional discipline, including sales, service delivery, operations, engineering and all corporate staff areas. Our combined business sales organization, which has over 2,000 associates is seeing many benefits of this combination as we can now offer a full suite of advanced products and services across a much larger customer base and a nationwide footprint. In fact, we're participating in more proposals for multi-location enterprise companies given our enhanced service offerings and broad coverage. 
We have rolled out our data center referral program and have integrated all product sales under one organization providing dedicated teams with specific product expertise to differentiate Windstream when selling complex offerings. In terms of systems, PAETEC and the Windstream CLEC business already operate in the same billing platform, and we're planning to migrate the former McLeod business that PAETEC had acquired to the system in early 2013. We're very pleased with the progress we're making thus far and remain confident in our ability to manage this integration. 
Turning to Slide 11, we are making great progress in our capital initiatives targeted for this year. During the quarter, we spent approximately $60 million in fiber to the tower investments. Today, we completed roughly 1,200 towers and have an additional 2,300 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. In addition, we opened the state-of-the-art data center in Little Rock designed to support the demand for this growing product and provide a secure and reliable environment for our cloud computing and managed services offerings. In terms of our broadband network, we are making investments to improve capacity given the demand for video over our network, and work is also underway on several of our broadband stimulus projects. While the success-based capital investment opportunities are elevating our total spend this year, beginning next year, we do expect our CapEx to decline over time to a more normalized level of 11% to 13% of revenues as the fiber to the tower and stimulus projects wind down. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with the results in both the business and consumer channels. Our team is doing a great job integrating PAETEC, investing in very attractive capital opportunities and focusing on our strategic growth initiatives, all of which position Windstream for long-term success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, he's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,183846063,302865,"Windstream Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 10, 2012",2012-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 12, with first quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.55 billion, operating income of $253 million and earnings per share of $0.11. Our GAAP results include approximat",948,"Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 12, with first quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.55 billion, operating income of $253 million and earnings per share of $0.11. Our GAAP results include approximately $14 million in after-tax and merger and integration expense and an after-tax gain of roughly $1 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would've been $0.13 for the first quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the first quarter. Windstream generated total revenue of $1.55 billion, a decrease of 0.5% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased an impressive $28 million or 3.2%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.6%. Wholesale revenues declined $15 million or 6.3% year-over-year, and total product sales declined $4 million or 6.6%. Within the business channel on Slide 14, data and integrated services grew by $29 million year-over-year driven by growth in IP, NexGen data and data center services. Carrier services was up $9 million due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Business voice long-distance revenues declined by $13million related to migrations from traditional voice services and integrated voice and data services. In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $15 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $6 million. In the wholesale channel, revenues declined $15 million or 6.3% year-over-year due to several factors. First, we continue to experience decline to Switched Access related to declining access lines and usage. Second, as per the ICC reform that went into effect on January 1, certain IP traffic is now being charged at lower rates. Third, and most significant, it became clear to us that certain PAETEC wholesale products were no longer viable in the marketplace. In particular, as part of the appeal of a prior court ruling in PAETEC's favor, the SEC made a court filing in March that provided clarification on billing practices for certain wholesale products. In addition, we've experienced an increase in a number of carrier disputes involving these products. Based on these developments and the importance of our strategic relationship with these carriers, we decide to suspend and modify certain wholesale products to minimize our financial exposure for the balance of the year and beyond. 
Now turning to expenses. Cash expenses increased $2 million year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services increased by $24 million due largely to network growth and higher interconnect costs, higher data center costs related to growth and expansion and higher pass-through federal USF charges. Cost of products sold decreased by $2 million as a result of fewer product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $20 million due to incremental deal synergies and lower advertising and marketing expenses. For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA is $594 million, a decrease of 1.6% year-over-year and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 38.5%. The wholesale development put pressure of roughly $12 million on revenue and $5 million on adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter. We spent $223 million on capital expenditures, excluding $3 million in integration capital. Adjusted free cash flow was $352 million, which was aided by $120 million federal tax refund we received in February. 
During the first quarter, working capital was a significant use of cash driven by couple of factors. First, prepaid was generally high in the first quarter and were higher than normal as these secured and paid for multiyear contracts to lower future operating expenses. Second, we experienced routine seasonal payroll and benefit payments, as well as one additional payroll cycle. We expect much of this to reverse course over the remainder of the year. We also completed 2 spectrum sales that's generated $57 million in proceeds during the quarter. For from a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $300 million on 2015 notes and amended our facility to extend a large portion of our term loan and maturity to 2016 and raise $280 million for additional proceeds to repay revolver borrowings and create future refinancing capacity. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.63x adjusted OIBDA, down slightly from the end of the year, and we remain committed to reducing net leverage to 3.2x to 3.4x. 
On Slide 17, for the remaining 3 quarters of this year, the development and our wholesale parts could put roughly $52 million and $32 million of pressure on revenue and adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Specifically, we expect the year-over-year declined to wholesale revenues of 12% in the second quarter and coupled with the intercarrier compensation reform effective July 1, we should see wholesale revenue to kind of 16% in the back half of this year. We expect consumer revenue trends in the back half of this year to improve given that we will increase end user surcharges as part of this reform. In addition, given our enterprise sales success today and our robust fiber installation pipeline, we expect our business service revenue growth rate to accelerate. Despite the wholesale revenue decline, we still expect to achieve the low-end of our revenue and adjusted OIBDA guidance range given the strength of our core business. 
As we look to 2013 and beyond on Slide 18, we expect continued strong performance in our business and consumer channel, which has lead to adjusted OIBDA growth. This, combined with significant reductions in capital spending and lower cash interest, will position us very well to pay our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future even with the expectation of higher cash taxes. With that, we'll now take a few of your questions. Kevin, if you could please review the instructions and open the call for questions?"

I'll get it started this morning. First, to provide some clarity, these wholesale Switched Access products are simply providing access to the PAETEC network, facilitating the origination and termination of voice traffic just to get some definitions out of the way. But when the PAETEC deal closed, I'm going to give you some more color on the timing, there were some carrier disputes related to some wholesale products. But PAETEC had a prior lower court ruling that supported their billing practices. And that ruling was appealed, and the appellant court asked the SEC to provide some guidance. And the SEC made a court filing in mid-March, which attempted to clarify certain billing practice that form the basis of those disputes. And obviously, that court filing by the SEC was unfavorable to Windstream and it is one we do not agree with. But in light of these disputes, and moreover in light of the larger strategic relationships that Windstream has with these carriers, we thought it prudent to suspend and modify these products. And based on the ongoing negotiations with these disputes, we've got to limit our comments specifically on this issue to that. But to kind of get to your next question, which I think is an important one, we do believe we've capped the P&L exposure related to this issue. And to your point, we've done a thorough vetting and review of the remaining products and see little risk. I would describe these as primarily just routine, resell products that PAETEC is providing. And those are products which Windstream have a deep level of experience and expertise."

As it relates to PAETEC, the transaction is so important for Windstream, and I'm so pleased with the results that the combined business channel is generating. PAETEC brought tremendous enterprise-level expertise and product offerings. We're seeing that. The benefits of our national footprint, it's really introduced Windstream to  a whole new sets of sales opportunities. With these capabilities, we are having tremendous success selling to larger, multi-location customers, as I said earlier. So with  PAETEC, we have the unique ability to offer sophisticated business solutions combined with our strategy, which we really believe and really have seen evidence in the marketplace that is differentiating by delivering us with a personal service that larger companies aren't able to execute on. And so overall, we are very pleased with the PAETEC transaction. The employees are playing a significant role in our company. If you look at our core business results, which is what that transaction was about, on that first slide that we included in our Investor Presentation, every quarter we've seen increasing sequential business sales. And so as it relates to that, we're very pleased with how the core business is performing.

And as a reminder, we do include cash tax refunds in our guidance. So as you look forward, we've talked a little bit about this into 2013. We do expect an increase in cash taxes. We're expecting an absolute number, roughly $250 million in cash tax payments in 2013. But given the reductions we expect in capital and as well as the anomaly whereas we have some incremental cash interest in 2012, we think we're well-positioned in 2013 as the CapEx ramps down, and we get more favorable cash interest. Furthermore, in 2014, with the fiber-to-the-tower stimulus bills are vastly complete, and we'll be a full cash taxpayer will be in a very good position from an overall dividend payout perspective.

I will begin be making a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
Turning to Slide 4, I am incredibly pleased with the outstanding performance in our core business. The business channel has gained significant traction with the acquisition of PAETEC, and our combined team is having tremendous success driving new sales opportunities. Business service revenue, which is our most important strategic growth area, grew 3.2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, an acceleration of 80 basis points sequentially. These outstanding results are a testament to the entire business sales team and to the value proposition Windstream offers business customers. 
The consumer channel also had a very solid quarter, driven by 5.9% year-over-year growth in broadband service revenues and continued success with our bundling strategy. Our wholesale revenue declined more than we expected due largely to our decision to suspend and modify certain wholesale products that were a part of the PAETEC portfolio, which Tony will discuss in more detail.
Turning to our strategic initiatives. I'm very pleased with how quickly the PAETEC team has assimilated into Windstream. The acquisition brought tremendous enterprise-level expertise and product offerings which have strengthened Windstream's already robust business division. We now have a nationwide fiber network capable of delivering advanced communications solutions to multi-location enterprises, which has opened many new doors. In fact, we are already seeing increased sales opportunity as a result of our enhanced capabilities and national footprint, and we're executing on our plan to offer smart solutions with personalized service, which we believe is a brand attribute that improves our competitive position. 
On the regulatory front, the SEC is conducting a process to develop and adopt final rules for universal service funding, which will be based on forward-looking cost models to expand broadband to high-cost areas. The initial November 2001 -- 2011 order provided for $300 million of interim support to price cap carriers to deploy broadband to unserved locations. Windstream is eligible for up to $60 million of this incremental support. Although we are not certain at this time how much we can accept under the SEC's requirements, we will continue our analysis over the next few months with the goal of accepting the maximum amount that meets our investment criteria. 
As we look forward, I'm extremely confident in the business that we have built. Through targeted acquisitions and our strategic growth initiatives, we have assembled an attractive set of assets capable of generating consistent cash flows over time. I am very encouraged with the longer-term prospects, given the accelerated growth rates in our business channel and the continued stability in our consumer business. 2012 is all about execution, integrating PAETEC and positioning this business for long-term success. As I have said before, our goal is to deliver consistent industry-leading shareholder returns, and our strategy will allow us to support our dividend over a long period of time and provide other opportunities in the future to increase shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent who will discuss our operating results."

Let me begin with an overview of the business channel on Slide 8. In the first quarter, pro forma business service revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year, representing a very nice acceleration in the growth rate both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our success in selling strategic business services. 
Business data and integrated services increased $29 million or 8.4% year-over-year, a result of strong growth in our VoIP and data bundles, data center services and next-generation data. In addition, we are seeing increased demand for data center co-location, cloud and managed services, which combined with our voice and data services, provide complete solutions for our business customers. 
Carrier revenue increased $9 million year-over-year or 6.2% driven by continued demand for additional circuits to meet growing bandwidth needs. Sequentially, carrier revenue was flat as carriers' demand for new TDM circuits slowed in advance of the transition to fiber. Importantly, we have a very robust funnel for fiber circuits, both in our ILEC  and non-ILEC territory, which we expect to be reflected in revenues throughout the year as we complete these fiber builds. 
For the sites we have placed in service, we are already seeing demand for additional bandwidth, resulting in incremental revenue as the circuits are priced on a per-meg basis. Business product sales was down $7 million year-over-year or 16%, but we do expect these revenues to improve in the second quarter and remainder of the year as we've been successful selling equipment to many large business customers, and we are gaining nice momentum in this group. 
Turning to the consumer channel on Slide 9. We saw continued stabilization in the overall trends as growth from broadband services offset some of the pressure from voice declines. We added 7,500 residential high-speed Internet customers growing our broadband customer base by 2.4% year-over-year, while consumer broadband revenues grew 5.9%. Our consumer broadband penetration is now at 68% of primary residential lines, positioning us very well as we place more emphasis on growing ARPU by selling faster Internet speeds and value-added broadband features and services. 
During the quarter, we rebranded our consumer offerings to provide an integrated high-speed Internet and entertainment bundle that leverages our Internet services with the Roku box that aggregates numerous entertainment apps, allowing customers to enhance their pay TV experience. Although still early, we've been encouraged with the initial results, which is driving better customer ARPU due to the higher price point and increased sales of faster broadband speeds. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our team is doing a great job integrating PAETEC on an aggressive timeline. We've integrated virtually every functional discipline, including sales, service delivery, operations, engineering and all corporate staff areas. Our combined business sales organization, which has over 2,000 associates is seeing many benefits of this combination as we can now offer a full suite of advanced products and services across a much larger customer base and a nationwide footprint. In fact, we are participating in more proposals for multi-location enterprise companies, given our enhanced service offerings and broad coverage. 
We have rolled out our data center referral program and have integrated all product sales under one organization, providing dedicated teams with specific product expertise to differentiate Windstream when selling complex offerings. In terms of systems, PAETEC and the Windstream CLEC business already operate on the same billing platform, and we are planning to migrate the former MCLoud business that PAETEC had acquired to this system in early 2013. We're very pleased with the progress we are making thus far and remain confident in our ability to manage this integration. 
Turning to Slide 11, we're making great progress on our capital initiatives targeted for this year. During the quarter, we spent approximately $60 million in fiber-to-the-tower investments. Today, we completed roughly 1,200 towers and have an additional 2,300 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. In addition, we opened the state-of-the-art data center in Little Rock designed to support the demand for this growing product and provide a secure and reliable environment for our cloud computing and managed services offerings. In terms of our broadband network, we are making investments to improve capacity, given the demand for video over our network, and work is also underway on several of our broadband stimulus projects. While the success-based capital investment opportunities are elevating our total spend this year, beginning next year, we do expect our CapEx intensity to decline over time to a more normalized level of 11% to 13% of revenues as the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with the results in both the business and consumer channels. Our team is doing a great job integrating PAETEC, investing in very attractive capital opportunities and focusing on our strategic growth initiatives, all of which position Windstream for long-term success. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,183846063,303119,"Windstream Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 10, 2012",2012-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.

Beginning on Slide 12, with first quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.55 billion, operating income of $253 million and earnings per share of $0.11. Our GAAP results include approximately $14 million in after-tax merger integration expense and an after-tax gain of roughly $1 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.13 for the first quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the first quarter. Windstream generated total revenue of $1.55 billion, a decrease of 0.5% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased an impressive $28 million or 3.2%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.6%. Wholesale revenues declined $15 million or 6.3% year-over-year, and total product sales declined $4 million or 6.6%. 
Within the business channel on Slide 14, data and integrated services grew by $29 million year-over-year, driven by growth in IP, next-gen data and data center services. Carrier services was up $9 million due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Business voice long-distance revenues declined by $13 million related to migrations from traditional voice services and integrated voice and data services. In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $15 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $6 million. In the wholesale channel, revenues declined $15 million or 6.3% year-over-year due to several factors. First, we continue to experience decline in Switched Access related to declining access lines and usage. Second, as per the ICC reform that went into effect on January 1, certain IP traffic is now being charged at lower rates. Third, and most significant, it became clear to us that certain PAETEC wholesale products were no longer viable in the marketplace. In particular, as part of the appeal of a prior lower court ruling in PAETEC's favor, the FCC made a court filing in March that provided clarification on billing practices for certain wholesale products. In addition, we've experienced an increase in a number of carrier disputes involving these products. Based on these developments and the importance of our strategic relationship with these carriers, we decided to suspend and modify certain wholesale products to minimize our financial exposure for the balance of the year and beyond. 
Now turning to expenses. Cash expenses increased $2 million year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services increased by $24 million due largely to network growth and higher interconnect costs, higher data center costs related to growth and expansion and higher pass-through federal USF surcharges. Cost of products sold decreased by $2 million as a result of fewer product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $20 million due to incremental deal synergies and lower advertising and marketing expenses. 
For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $594 million, a decrease of 1.6% year-over-year and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 38.5%. The wholesale developments put pressure of roughly $12 million on revenue and $5 million on adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter. We spent $223 million on capital expenditures, excluding $3 million in integration capital. Adjusted free cash flow was $352 million, which was aided by $120 million federal tax refund we received in February. 
During the first quarter, working capital was a significant use of cash, driven by a couple of factors. First, prepaid are generally high in the first quarter and were higher than normal, as these secured and paid for multiyear contracts to lower future operating expenses. Second, we experienced routine seasonal payroll and benefit payments, as well as one additional payroll cycle. We expect much of this to reverse course over the remainder of the year. We also completed 2 spectrum sales that's generated $57 million in proceeds during the quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $300 million on 2015 notes, and amended our credit facility to extend a large portion of our Term Loan A maturity to 2016, and raise $280 million for additional proceeds to repay revolver borrowings and create future refinancing capacity. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.63x adjusted OIBDA, down slightly from the end of the year, and we remain committed to reducing net leverage to 3.2x to 3.4x. 
On Slide 17, for the remaining 3 quarters of this year, the development of our wholesale parts could put roughly $52 million and $32 million of pressure on revenue and adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Specifically, we expect year-over-year declines in wholesale revenues of 12% in the second quarter, and coupled with the intercarrier compensation reform, effective July 1, we should see wholesale revenue declines of 16% in the back half of this year. We expect consumer revenue trends in the back half of this year to improve, given that we will increase end user surcharges as part of this reform. In addition, given our enterprise sales success today and our robust fiber installation pipeline, we expect our business service revenue growth rate to accelerate. Despite the wholesale revenue decline, we still expect to achieve the low-end of our revenue and adjusted OIBDA guidance range given the strength of our core business. 
As we look to 2013 and beyond on Slide 18, we expect continued strong performance in our business and consumer channel, which should lead to adjusted OIBDA growth. This, combined with significant reductions in capital spending and lower cash interest, will position us very well to pay our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future even with the expectation of higher cash taxes. With that, we'll now take a few of your questions. Kevin, if you could please review the instructions and open the call for questions?"

I'll get it started this morning. First, to provide some clarity, these wholesale Switched Access products are simply providing access to the PAETEC network, it's facilitating the origination and termination of voice traffic just to get some definitions out of the way. But when the PAETEC deal closed, I'm going to give you some more color on the timing, there were some carrier disputes related to certain wholesale products, but PAETEC had a prior lower court ruling that supported their billing practices. And that ruling was appealed and the appellate court asked the FCC to provide some guidance, and the FCC made a court filing in mid-March, which attempted to clarify certain billing practice that form the basis of those disputes. And obviously, that court filing by the FCC was unfavorable to Windstream, and it's one which we do not agree with. But in light of these disputes and moreover, in light of the larger strategic relationships that Windstream has with these carriers, we thought it prudent to suspend and modify these products. And based on the ongoing negotiations with these disputes, we've got to limit our comments specifically on this issue to that. But to kind of get to your next question, which I think is an important one, we do believe we capped the P&L exposure related to this issue. And to your point, we've done a thorough vetting and review of the remaining products and see little risk. I would describe these as primarily just routine, resell products that PAETEC was providing, and those are products which Windstream have a deep level of experience and expertise."

So with  PAETEC, we have the unique ability to offer sophisticated business solutions combined with our strategy, which we really believe and really have seen evidence in the marketplace that is differentiating by delivering this with a personal service that larger companies aren't able to execute on. And so overall, we are very pleased with the PAETEC transaction. The employees are playing a significant role in our company.

And as a reminder, we do include cash tax refunds in our guidance. So as you look forward, we've talked a little bit about this into 2013. We do expect an increase in cash taxes. We're expecting an absolute number, roughly $250 million in cash tax payments in 2013. But given the reductions we expect in capital and as well as the anomaly that led us to have some incremental cash interest in 2012, we think we're well-positioned in 2013 as the CapEx ramps down and we get more favorable cash interest.

We try to stay out of that. I'm really proud because the team's stayed focus during the quarter, driving results. And our nationwide footprint really has value, and where we see this showing up is reps in one specific market. When they were in a deal before, now they're competitive with a larger percent of the revenue that's out there as an opportunity as part of that proposal. And simply because we can win a bigger chunk of that revenue proposal, we're seeing a lot of momentum, and this nationwide footprint really have some value. That's definitely one of the reasons we saw an increase in sales this quarter. And much of that did help with the results we saw in revenue this quarter.

And from a customer standpoint, that's really where they saw the added value, including that entertainment bundle as part of that offer as well. After we -- and again, I'll reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks. That, for us, is all about trying to convince people to switch from cable to Windstream for their broadband product, focusing again on the entertainment that comes along with that high-speed Internet connection, and that's increasingly important for us. I mean, as I mentioned, we've got incredible penetration and so for us, the key growth in that franchise is all about a switcher proposition, and we think Merge is indeed that for us.

It's less than $100 million growing in double-digits, and I might say in the 10% to 15% range, and we like to see that accelerate. We, in last year, invested just around $40 million bringing up 4 new centers and continue to push really in filling that up with customers just as fast as possible. So a lot of excitement and momentum there. Around tower, what I'm talking about is really as we start bringing these fiber sites, these are priced on a per-meg basis, typically starting at a 50-meg assumption as kind of the base rate where those billings begin, and they tend to tick-up every 50-meg. And we're seeing about half of those towers come in right around 100-meg versus our original assumption which was 50, and that's incrementally more revenue. It's not double what it is, I mean, because those price increments began to really decline like you typically expect in a purchasing contract. But nonetheless, it's revenue accretive in a trend we like to see. And our view has always been and remains if you got conviction and growth, as it pertains to wireless data, you got to love these investments in fiber-to-the-tower, and that's why we've been so bullish on them and remained so based on the data we're seeing. Now it's still early, of course, and the later part of this year is really where we start to deliver the vast majority of our fiber sites."

Well, thank you all for listening to us today and for your continued support of Windstream. In closing, I have a few comments. Our business in consumer channels delivered outstanding performance during the first quarter, and I am very excited about the opportunities ahead. The PAETEC integration is going as planned and we are already seeing tremendous momentum as we've said many times on this call from this combination.

I will begin be making a few comments about our results and strategic activities. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
Turning to Slide 4, I am incredibly pleased with the outstanding performance in our core business. The business channel has gained significant traction with the acquisition of PAETEC, and our combined team is having tremendous success driving new sales opportunities. Business service revenue, which is our most important strategic growth area, grew 3.2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, an acceleration of 80 basis points sequentially. These outstanding results are a testament to the entire business sales team and to the value proposition Windstream offers business customers. 
The consumer channel also had a very solid quarter, driven by 5.9% year-over-year growth in broadband service revenues and continued success with our bundling strategy. Our wholesale revenue declined more than we expected, due largely to our decision to suspend and modify certain wholesale products that were a part of the PAETEC portfolio, which Tony will discuss in more detail.
Turning to our strategic initiatives. I'm very pleased with how quickly the PAETEC team has assimilated into Windstream. The acquisition brought tremendous enterprise-level expertise and product offerings, which have strengthened Windstream's already robust business division. We now have a nationwide fiber network capable of delivering advanced communications solutions to multi-location enterprises, which has opened many new doors. In fact, we are already seeing increased sales opportunity as a result of our enhanced capabilities and national footprint, and we're executing on our plan to offer smart solutions with personalized service, which we believe is a brand attribute that improves our competitive position. 
On the regulatory front, the SEC is conducting a process to develop and adopt final rules for universal service funding, which will be based on forward-looking cost models to extend broadband to high-cost areas. The initial November 2001 -- 2011 order provided for $300 million of interim support to price cap carriers [ph] to deploy broadband to unserved locations. Windstream is eligible for up to $60 million of this incremental support. Although we are not certain at this time how much we can accept under the SEC's requirements, we will continue our analysis over the next few months with the goal of accepting the maximum amount that meets our investment criteria. 
As we look forward, I'm extremely confident in the business that we have built. Through targeted acquisitions and our strategic growth initiatives, we have assembled an attractive set of assets capable of generating consistent cash flows over time. I am very encouraged with the longer-term prospects given the accelerated growth rates in our business channel and the continued stability in our consumer business. 2012 is all about execution, integrating PAETEC and positioning this business for long-term success. As I have said before, our goal is to deliver consistent, industry-leading shareholder returns, and our strategy will allow us to support our dividend over a long period of time and provide other opportunities in the future to increase shareholder value. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent, who will discuss our operating results."
25090458,183846063,303413,"Windstream Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 10, 2012",2012-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.

Let me begin with an overview of the business channel on Slide 8. In the first quarter, pro forma business service revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year, representing a very nice acceleration in the growth rate, both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our success in selling strategic business services. 
Business data and integrated services increased $29 million or 8.4% year-over-year, a result of strong growth in our VoIP and data bundles, data center services and next-generation data. In addition, we are seeing increased demand for data center colocation, cloud and managed services, which, combined with our voice and data services, provide complete solutions for our business customers. 
Carrier revenue increased $9 million year-over-year or 6.2% driven by continued demand for additional circuits to meet growing bandwidth needs. Sequentially, carrier revenue was flat as carriers' demand for new TDM circuits slowed in advance of the transition to fiber. Importantly, we have a very robust funnel for fiber circuits, both in our ILEC  territory and non-ILEC territory, which we expect to be reflected in revenues throughout the year as we complete these fiber builds. 
For the sites we have placed in service, we are already seeing demand for additional bandwidth, resulting in incremental revenue as the circuits are priced on a per-meg basis. Business product sales was down $7 million year-over-year or 16%, but we do expect these revenues to improve in the second quarter and remainder of the year as we've been successful selling equipment to many large business customers, and we are gaining nice momentum in this group. 
Turning to the consumer channel on Slide 9. We saw continued stabilization in the overall trends as growth from broadband services offset some of the pressure from voice declines. We added 7,500 residential high-speed Internet customers, growing our broadband customer base by 2.4% year-over-year, while consumer broadband revenues grew 5.9%. Our consumer broadband penetration is now at 68% of primary residential lines, positioning us very well as we place more emphasis on growing ARPU by selling faster Internet speeds and value-added broadband features and services. 
During the quarter, we rebranded our consumer offerings to provide an integrated high-speed Internet and entertainment bundle that leverages our Internet services with a Roku box that aggregates numerous entertainment apps, allowing customers to enhance their pay TV experience. Although still early, we've been encouraged with the initial results, which is driving better customer ARPU due to the higher price point and increased sales of faster broadband speeds. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our team is doing a great job integrating PAETEC on an aggressive timeline. We've integrated virtually every functional discipline, including sales, service delivery, operations, engineering and all corporate staff areas. Our combined business sales organization, which has over 2,000 associates, is seeing many benefits of this combination as we can now offer a full suite of advanced products and services across a much larger customer base and a nationwide footprint. In fact, we are participating in more proposals for multi-location enterprise companies, given our enhanced service offerings and broad coverage. 
We have rolled out our data center referral program and have integrated all product sales under one organization, providing dedicated teams with specific product expertise to differentiate Windstream when selling complex offerings. In terms of systems, PAETEC and the Windstream CLEC business already operate on the same billing platform, and we are planning to migrate the former MCLoud business that PAETEC had acquired to this system in early 2013. We're very pleased with the progress we are making thus far and remain confident in our ability to manage this integration. 
Turning to Slide 11, we're making great progress on our capital initiatives targeted for this year. During the quarter, we spent approximately $60 million in fiber-to-the-tower investments. Today, we've completed roughly 1,200 towers and have an additional 2,300 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. In addition, we opened a state-of-the-art data center in Little Rock designed to support the demand for this growing product and provide a secure and reliable environment for our cloud computing and managed services offerings. In terms of our broadband network, we are making investments to improve capacity, given the demand for video over our network, and work is also under way on several of our broadband stimulus projects. While the success-based capital investment opportunities are elevating our total spend this year, beginning next year, we do expect our CapEx intensity to decline over time to a more normalized level of 11% to 13% of revenues as the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with the results in both the business and consumer channels. Our team is doing a great job integrating PAETEC, investing in very attractive capital opportunities and focusing on our strategic growth initiatives, all of which position Windstream for long-term success. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,183846063,303413,"Windstream Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 10, 2012",2012-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone.

Beginning on Slide 12, with first quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.55 billion, operating income of $253 million and earnings per share of $0.11. Our GAAP results include approximately $14 million in after-tax merger integration expense and an after-tax gain of roughly $1 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.13 for the first quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results for the first quarter. Windstream generated total revenue of $1.55 billion, a decrease of 0.5% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues increased an impressive $28 million or 3.2%, while consumer service revenues declined by $9 million or 2.6%. Wholesale revenues declined $15 million or 6.3% year-over-year, and total product sales declined $4 million or 6.6%. 
Within the business channel on Slide 14, data and integrated services grew by $29 million year-over-year, driven by growth in IP, next-gen data and data center services. Carrier services was up $9 million due to strong demand for wireless backhaul services. Business voice long-distance revenues declined by $13 million related to migrations from traditional voice services and integrated voice and data services. In the consumer channel, voice and long distance declined $15 million due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which was offset partially by growth in broadband revenues of $6 million. In the wholesale channel, revenues declined $15 million or 6.3% year-over-year due to several factors. First, we continue to experience decline in Switched Access related to declining access lines and usage. Second, as per the ICC reform that went into effect on January 1, certain IP traffic is now being charged at lower rates. Third, and most significant, it became clear to us that certain PAETEC wholesale products were no longer viable in the marketplace. In particular, as part of the appeal of a prior lower court ruling in PAETEC's favor, the FCC made a court filing in March that provided clarification on billing practices for certain wholesale products. In addition, we've experienced an increase in the number of carrier disputes involving these products. Based on these developments and the importance of our strategic relationship with these carriers, we decided to suspend and modify certain wholesale products to minimize our financial exposure for the balance of the year and beyond. 
Now turning to expenses. Cash expenses increased $2 million year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services increased by $24 million, due largely to network growth and higher interconnect costs, higher data center costs related to growth and expansion and higher pass-through federal USF surcharges. Cost of products sold decreased by $2 million as a result of fewer product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $20 million due to incremental deal synergies and lower advertising and marketing expenses. 
For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $594 million, a decrease of 1.6% year-over-year, and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 38.5%. The wholesale developments put pressure of roughly $12 million on revenue and $5 million on adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter. We spent $223 million on capital expenditures, excluding $3 million in integration capital. Adjusted free cash flow was $352 million, which was aided by a $120 million federal tax refund we received in February. 
During the first quarter, working capital was a significant use of cash, driven by a couple of factors. First, prepaids are generally high in the first quarter and were higher than normal, as these secured and paid for multiyear contracts to lower future operating expenses. Second, we experienced routine seasonal payroll and benefit payments as well as one additional payroll cycle. We expect much of this to reverse course over the remainder of the year. We also completed 2 spectrum sales which generated $57 million in proceeds during the quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, we refinanced $300 million on 2015 notes and amended our credit facility to extend a large portion of our Term Loan A maturity to 2016 and raise $280 million of additional proceeds to repay revolver borrowings and create future refinancing capacity. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.63x adjusted OIBDA, down slightly from the end of the year, and we remain committed to reducing net leverage to 3.2x to 3.4x. 
On Slide 17, for the remaining 3 quarters of this year, the development in our wholesale products could put roughly $52 million and $32 million of pressure on revenue and adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Specifically, we expect year-over-year declines in wholesale revenues of 12% in the second quarter, and coupled with the intercarrier compensation reform, effective July 1, we should see wholesale revenue declines of 16% in the back half of this year. We expect consumer revenue trends in the back half of this year to improve, given that we will increase end user surcharges as part of this reform. In addition, given our enterprise sales success today and our robust fiber installation pipeline, we expect our business service revenue growth rate to accelerate. Despite the wholesale revenue decline, we still expect to achieve the low end of our revenue and adjusted OIBDA guidance range, given the strength of our core business. 
As we look to 2013 and beyond on Slide 18, we expect continued strong performance in our business and consumer channels, which should lead to adjusted OIBDA growth. This, combined with significant reductions in capital spending and lower cash interest, will position us very well to pay our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional returns of capital in the future even with the expectation of higher cash taxes. 
With that, we'll now take a few of your questions. Kevin, if you could please review the instructions and open the call to questions?"

First, to provide some clarity, these wholesale Switched Access products are simply providing access to the PAETEC network.  It's facilitating the origination and termination of voice traffic, just to get some definitions out of the way. But when the PAETEC deal closed, I'm going to give you some more color on the timing, there were some carrier disputes related to certain wholesale products, but PAETEC had a prior lower-court ruling that supported their billing practices. And that ruling was appealed, and the appellate court asked the FCC to provide some guidance.  And the FCC made a court filing in mid-March, which attempted to clarify certain billing practice that formed the basis of those disputes. And obviously, that court filing by the FCC was unfavorable to Windstream, and it's one which we do not agree with. But in light of these disputes and, moreover, in light of the larger strategic relationships that Windstream has with these carriers, we thought it prudent to suspend and modify these products. And based on the ongoing negotiations with these disputes, we've got to limit our comments specifically on this issue to that. But to kind of get to your next question, which I think is an important one, we do believe we capped the P&L exposure related to this issue. And to your point, we've done a thorough vetting and review of the remaining products and see little risk. I would describe these as primarily just routine resell products that PAETEC was providing, and those are products with which Windstream has a deep level of experience and expertise."

So with  PAETEC, we have the unique ability to offer sophisticated business solutions combined with our strategy, which we really believe and really have seen evidence in the marketplace that it is differentiating by delivering this with a personal service that larger companies aren't able to execute on. And so overall, we are very pleased with the PAETEC transaction. Their employees are playing a significant role in our company.

But more specifically to your question, that left roughly $10 million of remaining revenue in the first quarter. So when you step back and look at the year as a whole, we've really removed from our plans $64 million of revenue and $37 million of adjusted OIBDA related to these wholesale products.

We believe we have a reasonable and appropriate reserve associated with these items and from an AR perspective, and it should not be an issue from a P&L perspective moving forward."

And as a reminder, we do include cash tax refunds in our guidance. So as you look forward, we've talked a little bit about this into 2013. We do expect an increase in cash taxes. We're expecting an absolute number, roughly $250 million, in cash tax payments in 2013. But given the reductions we expect in capital and as well as the anomaly that led us to have some incremental cash interest in 2012, we think we're well-positioned in 2013 as the CapEx ramps down and we get more favorable cash interest.

We try to stay out of that. I'm really proud because the team's stayed focused during the quarter, driving results. And our nationwide footprint really has value, and where we see this showing up is reps in one specific market, when they were in a deal before, now they're competitive with a larger percent of the revenue that's out there as an opportunity as part of that proposal. And simply because we can win a bigger chunk of that revenue proposal, we're seeing a lot of momentum, and this nationwide footprint really have some value.

And from a customer standpoint, that's really where they saw the added value, including that entertainment bundle as part of that offer as well. After we -- and again, I'll reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks. That, for us, is all about trying to convince people to switch from cable to Windstream for their broadband product, focusing again on the entertainment that comes along with that high-speed Internet connection, and that's increasingly important for us. I mean, as I mentioned, we've got incredible penetration, and so for us to keep growing that franchise, it's all about a switcher proposition, and we think Merge is indeed that for us.

And we're seeing about half of those towers come in right around 100-meg versus our original assumption, which was 50, and that's incrementally more revenue. It's not double what it is, I mean, because those price increments began to really decline, like you typically expect in a purchasing contract.

We've long passed that kind of -- we've built out most customers that would require that little additional cash. So what we're working on is a way to work with the commission, because we think there's a lot we can do to improve broadband service and rule America to get to more customers to be creative around that. And so that's what we're spending all of our time on, talking to the FCC, looking at our own opportunities to see how we can use as much of that money as possible, because I think, generally, that will just improve what I think is already one of the highest addressability of businesses in the country. 
Well, thank you all for listening to us today and for your continued support of Windstream. In closing, I have a few comments. Our business in consumer channels delivered outstanding performance during the first quarter, and I am very excited about the opportunities ahead. The PAETEC integration is going as planned, and we are already seeing tremendous momentum, as we've said many times on this call, from this combination. Overall, Windstream's core business is performing very well, and I'm very confident in our ability to deliver strong, stable free cash flows capable of supporting our dividend well into the future and increasing shareholder value.

I'm going to begin by discussing the progress we are making in our strategic goals, tony will review our financial performance and then Brent will discuss our operating results. Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaw",599,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by discussing the progress we are making in our strategic goals, tony will review our financial performance and then Brent will discuss our operating results. 
Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaways that I would like to emphasize today are: First, we are confident in our strategy and our businesses is performing well, our second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our 2012 plan. Next, we are driving profitable growth in our strategic areas of business and broadband through a combination of targeted acquisitions, our operational focus and success-based capital investments. At the same time, we continue to improve our cost structure. 
2012 is a peak CapEx year, driven by unique opportunities to grow organically with success-based capital investments. And coincidentally, these investments occur in a year with very favorable tax treatment. As we move into 2013 and beyond, capital will decline and we expect to also benefit from lower cash interest and growth in adjusted OIBDA. As a result, Windstream is positioned to deliver sustainable and growing free cash flow. 
The dividend is a key component of our strategy. Yesterday, we declared our 25th consecutive dividend of $0.25 per quarter, and the cash generation capabilities of this business allow us to adequately invest in our network to support growth opportunities while paying the dividend well into the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. Windstream's long-term strategy is straightforward. Improved revenue, aggressively manage expenses and pursue targeted acquisitions, all with the goal of increasing free cash flow per share and in turn, creating shareholder value. We have made substantial improvements in our revenue mix and financial trends over the past 6 years by executing this strategy and we continue to make progress during the quarter. 
Specifically, turning to Slide 6, our strategic growth areas account for 68% of Windstream's total revenue, and collectively, grew 2.5% year-over-year during second quarter. Business service revenue grew by 2%. Our business sales team is participating in many new sales opportunities as a result of our expanded network, robust product lineup and our personalized service which has improved our competitive position. Consumer broadband service revenue grew by 4% year-over-year. The result of our focus on monetizing our industry-leading penetration by selling incremental broadband features and faster speed. Additionally, we are investing capital in growth initiatives that further improve our financial profile and offer attractive returns. Cost management is a core competency for Windstream and we took steps in the second quarter to further improve our cost structure. We announced that we are restructuring our management organization to increase the efficiency of our decision-making and serve our customers more effectively. The reorganization is expected to yield $30 million to $40 million in annualized cost savings, primarily benefiting the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to achieve $50 million in synergies in 2012 related to the PAETEC acquisition. 
Our targeted acquisition strategy has strengthened Windstream. The power of a nationwide network is significantly enhancing our ability to win larger, multi-location enterprise deals and our sophisticated offerings and brand promise of personalized service are resonating very well. The PAETEC integration activities are on track and we are making solid progress as a combined organization. 
In summary, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our plan. We see a clear path of growing free cash flow per share which will support our dividend well into the future. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our second quarter financial results."

Turning to Slide 7 where the second quarter Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.54 billion, operating income of $239 million and earnings per share of $0.09. Our results included approximately $12 million in after-tax merger integration expense and $6 million in restructuring costs. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would've been $0.12 for the second quarter. 
On Slide 8, Windstream generated pro forma revenue of $1.54 billion during the second quarter, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues grew by $18 million or 2%, consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Wholesale revenues declined $29 million or 12% year-over-year, and total product sales increased by $14 million or 26%. 
Within the business channel on Slide 9, data and integrated services grew by $28 million year-over-year or 8%, due to growth in IP, next-generation data and data center services. Carrier revenue was up $7 million or 5% related to strong demand for increased capacity in wireless backhaul services. Business voice long-distance revenues decreased by $20 million due to ongoing migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services.  Importantly, our business team has been achieving their sales targets and we are well positioned to deliver on our plan for the remainder of the year.  Business product sales increased by $3 million or 8% as we saw an increase in enterprise-related product sales. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long distance revenue declined by $14 million or 7% due to pure voice lines and declining feature packages. Business partially offset by growth in broadband revenues which increased $4 million or 4%. With broadband penetration reaching 69% of primary customer lines, we are focusing on improving customer ARPU by upselling features, add-on services and faster broadband speed. Wholesale revenue declined by $12 million year-over-year which was in line with our expectations. First, Switched Access revenues decreased by $28 million, due to the clients related to pure access line and the modifications we made to certain PAETEC wholesale products last quarter. USF revenues increased by $4 million year-over-year driven by higher energy surpass through surcharges. Wholesale voice and data revenue, which includes over traditional resell business, declined by $5 million due to pure access line and lower usage. 
Sequentially, total service revenues decreased by $18 million or 1.2%, this was largely due to declines in wholesale revenue related to changes to the PAETEC Switched Access products I just mentioned. As a reminder, we have $10 million revenues related to these products in the first quarter. We also had a sequential decline in business, voice and long distance revenue due to migration integrated voice and data services. In addition, retail long-distance usage was higher in the first quarter and returned to a more consistent run rate during the second quarter. 
In the consumer channel, revenue declined by $1 million sequentially, which was an improvement from the roughly $4 million trend we have experienced over the last few quarters. 
On Slide 10, cash expenses improved by approximately $7 million or 1% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services increased by $9 million due to network growth and air connection costs, increased data center costs due to growth and expansion, and higher pass-through the U.S. as surcharges which were partially offset by seasonal decline in payroll taxes and other benefit costs. Cost of products sold increased by $13 million, consistent with better product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $29 million or 11% due $12 million incremental deal synergies and other cost management initiatives. Sequentially, cash expenses declined by $9 million or 1%, related to incremental PAETEC synergies declines in seasonal payroll taxes and other cost management initiatives which were offset partially by an increase in seasonal operating expenses and higher product sales. For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $596 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. Sequentially, adjusted OIBDA increased by $2 million and the margin improved by 30 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter we spent $267 million on capital expenditures, which included $70 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $7 million on broadband deployment related to stimulus projects. In addition, we spent $9 million of integration capital related to network optimization opportunities as a part of our PAETEC integration plans. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the SDC established an interim $300 million based on Connect America fund to further assist price cap carriers in deploying broadband in unserved locations of which Windstream is eligible for up to $60 million. Given the framework to accept this forward, combined with our already higher broadband visibility, very few opportunities met our investment criteria. We accepted roughly 700,000 for this quarter [ph] under the current framework and also filed a waiver seeking to modify certain requirements which will enable us to accept all of the funds and expand our broadband footprint. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $135 million during the second quarter which was down $91 million year-over-year, while actual adjusted OIBDA grew by $86 million with the addition of PAETEC. This was offset by higher CapEx of $96 million and an increase in cash interest to $79 million which was largely due to a shift in the timing of our interest payments due to our refinancing activities. Now, a majority of our interest payment fall within the second and fourth quarters whereas last year, the bulk of those payments were in the first and third quarters. For the first 6 months of 2012, we generated $487 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid out $294 million in dividends. During the second quarter, working capital was a $15 million source of cash. 
Turning to Slide 12, we strengthened the balance sheet by amending our credit agreement in order to raise $900 million of additional proceeds which we used to fully repay our outstanding revolver balance and create sufficient liquidity to refinance the 2013 debt maturities. This transaction did not change our net leverage ratio and allows us to repay the 2013 debt maturities without further need to access the debt markets. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.66x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to reducing net leverage to 3.2 to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA and we will make significant progress toward this goal next year as we permanently pay down a portion of 2013 maturities, which will allow us to reach the top end of our targeted leverage ratio by the end of 2013. 
Turning to Slide 13, our plan for 2012 remains on track. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see sequential improvement in revenue and adjusted OIBDA, particularly in the fourth quarter related to enterprise sales success to date, incremental fiber installations, additional PAETEC synergies and the cost savings related to our ongoing reorganization efforts. Importantly, improvements that we expect in the back half of the year are based on activities that are well underway, and we are comfortable that we will achieve the low-end -- the lower end of the revenue adjusted OIBDA guidance rate that we provided in February. 
As we look to 2013 and beyond on Slide 14, we expect strong performance to drive growth in the business channel and continued stability in the consumer channel which, combined with the cost savings initiatives, should lead to adjusted OIBDA growth. This together with significant reductions in capital spending and lower cash interest positions us very well to sustain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional shareholder friendly activities even with the expectations of higher cash taxes. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to provide more color on our operating results."

During in the second quarter, business sales momentum remained strong and our core services performed very well. We completed the rebranding efforts in the PAETEC markets and are seeing many benefits to operating as a combined company. We were successfully competing for large enterprise business customers and seeing positive results from our advanced service capabilities and personalized service. We are different to Windstream by providing on integrated sales approach which includes the collaboration of network engineers and dedicated product and data center specialists to customize solutions for business customers. We are equally focused on small business customers and are differentiate differentiating Windstream by offering innovative bundles that combine web hosting, design and maintenance with a full suite of voice and broadband services. We're seeing increased demand for data center co-location, cloud, and managed services from both large and small business customers. The carrier business continues to grow nicely driven growing customer bandwidth needs and wireless backhaul. 
On Slide 16, consumer voice lines declined by approximately $24,000 in the second quarter and represented a 4.4% decline in total customers year-over-year. We had a net loss of high-speed internet customers of 4,600, in part due to our high penetration of 69% of primary residential customers. We rebranded our consumer offerings in March to provide an innovative, entertainment bundle with our voice and high-speed Internet service and the Roku device, allowing customers to enhance their pay TV experience by streaming video content over the Internet. While this promotion draws better customer ARPU and enhance the utility of the broadband connection, the higher price point and traditional second quarter seasonality pressures contributed to slower sales. In the third quarter, we introduced revised pricing in order to increase sales trends. 
Turning to Slide 17, the PAETEC integration is proceeding in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we have integrated all functional workgroups and corporate systems and are operating as a combined sales and operations organization. The team is leveraging our full suite of products and services across a much larger customer base and our nationwide network is providing increased sales opportunities, particularly to multi-location enterprises. The PAETEC building commercial activities are underway and remain on track. We are very pleased with the milestones we have reached thus far and remain confident in our ability to achieve the targeted synergies and successfully integrate PAETEC. 
On Slide 18, we are making great progress on our capital initiatives plan for this year. To date, we completed fiber to over 1,500 towers and have around 2,100 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. As a reminder, we expect to reach between 4,000 and 5,000 towers both in and out of our ILEC footprint by the end of 2013 which will include the maturity of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. We are also making investments in our broadband network to improve capacity and work is continuing on the broadband stimulus projects which should add roughly $75,000 of new addressable lights upon completion and provide a nice opportunity to further increase our broadband penetration. While our capital spend has elevated this year, beginning next year, we expect CapEx intensity to decline to a more normalized level of 11% to 13% of revenues as our fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down.

We kind of talked about it in the call because in Q1, what we really saw at that point was accelerated usage revenues that frankly just didn't continue into Q2. We saw Q2 trends revert back to what we have seen really in the Q3, Q4 timeframe of last year, not totally surprising but that's really the biggest driver there.

In the second quarter, there is a couple of things that are going on are worth explaining. First, seasonally, you tend to see slower sales in Q2 versus Q1 and that certainly was true for us. That slow down was actually less on the growth ad side than we saw a year ago but the overall volume was down which put as much is and I think is a function of our penetration. The ratio lower sales target to our existing customers. So for us merge was all about increasing our prospects and really changing the dynamics the discussion away from speed to the value of the entertainment package. That's was merge was really about. We started momentum slowed, the timing of that launch coincided with what I would define as more aggressive pricing action by our competition, and that definitely had an impact, that coupled with seasonality and just decides of our base is really what caused us to be slightly negative there. But we kind of talked for a while. First given our penetration it's not just about customer account comments also about revenue growth and so we've had and continue to have such a huge focus around that value-added services tied to that broadband product. That's really where we are anchoring kind of the future growth of that franchise to not just customer growth. I did talk about the customer growth opportunity that we'll see which is largely tied to this in his projects we have underway whereby whenever ultimately we will have passed 75,000 incremental new prospects we can kind of add to our list, Scott."

So Tony, I think that when you are reading the state you are seeing or reiterating the low-end of your guidance and record yourself you said the lower end we're in the middle of third quarter you guys are kind of reiterating a number for EBITDA that would be $2.43 billion or better, the consensus on the street is actually tens of million below that and it seems like if you're going to get to just very low end of the guidance number, you have to show up with kind of $620 million of EBITDA per quarter for the next 2 quarters in order to get there from where we were in the first half. So it's not just a slight acceleration, it's a pretty monumental acceleration and obviously the street is skeptical if it can really be accomplished. So if you can kind of walk through the mechanics of where your conviction comes from that, that kind of acceleration is possible numerically will be really helpful. And then the second question is going to you if I think you're a rich person is probably does not understand adjusted free cash flow, right, there going to look in the free cash flow statement and see that in the first half give had operating cash flow of x, it was slightly higher than your CapEx and your dividends and so the payout ratio looks like it's very, very high right now. Can you talk about how that is going to change in the second half? How does that dividend get more comfortable for you guys relative to the first half if I ignore the adjustments and just look at the cash flow statement?"

And let me start with your guidance. As I alluded to, sequential improvements we need to see and the back half of the year I really being driven by the increase in business service revenue, as well as the cost-saving initiatives. So",552,"Great question, David. And let me start with your guidance. As I alluded to, sequential improvements we need to see and the back half of the year I really being driven by the increase in business service revenue, as well as the cost-saving initiatives. So when you look at the business service revenue, we would look into the funnel, we see what we have, as Brent alluded to, we know we is all here now, we have that better visibility throughout the third quarter, as well as on the carrier business, our fiber-to-the-tower pipeline we also get better visibility into what that is going to yield in the third quarter and beyond. So it's really just looking into our sales funnel and the conviction we have around our sales organization in terms of being able to the results in the back half of the year. And then on the cost management side, we've already taken the actions necessary to achieve a lot of our cost savings. We've already identified specific expense reductions we expect to make with regards to PAETEC in the back half of the year, and we've also -- we are also ramping up our management reorganization efforts into third quarter. So we've taken those actions, we have clear visibility into those cost savings and that's really where we obtain our conviction is based on what we see today and but obviously we need to execute and we need to continue to execute well in the back half of the year for us to achieve the lower end of our guidance range. And then your question on cash flow. We do use the adjusted free cash flow model because it excludes certainly, really just a few things, the few things that excludes are merger and integration expense which are cost we incurred simply to integrate our acquisitions and mostly our cost than the second quarter, as well as the first half of the year are related to PAETEC. And we do expect to continue to incur some M&I expenses in the back half of the year. And also, we also exclude restructuring charges and given the management organization that we're going through, we do expect incur some onetime structuring charges associated with that effort. And other item we exclude is working capital. But as we look to the back half of the year, I think there will be some pressure from M&I in the totality of the cash flow and we look beyond 2012 and it's 2013, them M&I expense is significantly last and we did not anticipate any significant restructuring expenses. So those are really discrete onetime items that are non-recurring in nature. So I think ultimately, that's what gives us the confidence associated with the dividend payout ratio plus just when we look at the 2013, we were at this meeting adjusted OIBDA growth as we have talked a lot about expect that fiber-to-the-tower investment to start weigh in '13 and we have taken some actions to improve our interest payments. I think, taken into account, we are very comfortable with that -- the cash flow generation capabilities of this company and I think that'll be more easily seen in 2013 than it is in 2012 simply due to the merger integration expenses we are occurring this year."

I think we took the approach of going to the term loan A market because, one, it is readily available and it's much more cost effective than the unsecured debt market. So when you look at the unsecured debt market, Windstream's yields are between 6% and 7% today, but in the terminal market that we were able to reduce money at LIBOR plus 2 in a quarter and LIBOR plus 300. So those are very attractive rates. And by as you alluded to by raising this money, we completely freed up our revolver sod and we have $1.25 billion on our revolver with no withdrawals on it, so as we look into our 2013 maturities, we are in a great position without having to go to the that market to date to completely pay off those that maturities. So we are in a great spot. As we look into 2013, as we always do, we remain active in the capital market and it our times. The real reason that I think we look to the term loan market is really we are looking for our race tickets into lower our cash interest, as well as be able to find very attractive capital, and I think that's what we accomplished."

We do believe we'll complete with the stimulus projects this year and then certainly make a major progress in terms of our fiber-to-the-tower construction efforts this year as well. Those 2 things alone could frankly reduce our CapEx next year by almost $200 million. Those are 2 big things that are happening next year that will make CapEx look different than 2012. And as we've talked about fiber-to-the-tower before I mean, 60% to 70% of that effort is within our ILEC footprint. That effort was about retention pretension, as well as growing that revenue stream because those deals are priced on user based basis. The remaining part of that effort was all outside of our territory which was a network expansion and 100% of those revenues are incremental. And the commendation of those 2 kind of parallel pass for us was about keeping that revenue trend in that mid-single-digit range we have expensed over the past 18 or so months at 5% to 7%, and that's really what we are targeting to make happen."

Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements. Please review the Safe Harbor language found on our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us on our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable  GAAP measure are also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. We have provided supplemental pro forma financial results, including the PAETEC business for all periods shown. Given that Windstream and PAETEC had different operating metric disclosures, we are continuing to develop a unified approach and plan to introduce additional disclosures later this year. 
At this time, we have continued to provide the business operating metrics for Legacy Windstream. In addition, we reclassified some minor revenue and expense items and adjusted the prior periods accordingly. We will make references to these pro forma results, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call.

25090458,212273147,342047,"Windstream Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by discussing the progress we are making on our strategic goals, Tony will review our financial performance and then Brent will discuss our operating results. Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaw",600,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by discussing the progress we are making on our strategic goals, Tony will review our financial performance and then Brent will discuss our operating results. 
Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaways that I would like to emphasize today are: First, we are confident in our strategy and our business is performing well, our second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our 2012 plan. Next, we are driving profitable growth in our strategic areas of business and broadband through a combination of targeted acquisitions, our operational focus and success-based capital investments. At the same time, we continue to improve our cost structure. 
2012 is a peak CapEx year, driven by unique opportunities to grow organically with success-based capital investments. And coincidentally, these investments occur in a year with very favorable tax treatment. As we move into 2013 and beyond, capital will decline, and we expect to also benefit from lower cash interest and growth in adjusted OIBDA. As a result, Windstream is positioned to deliver sustainable and growing free cash flow. 
The dividend is a key component of our strategy. Yesterday, we declared our 25th consecutive dividend of $0.25 per quarter, and the cash generation capabilities of this business allow us to adequately invest in our network to support growth opportunities while paying the dividend well into the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. Windstream's long-term strategy is straightforward: Improve revenue, aggressively manage expenses and pursue targeted acquisitions, all with the goal of increasing free cash flow per share and in turn, creating shareholder value. We have made substantial improvements in our revenue mix and financial trends over the past 6 years by executing this strategy, and we continue to make progress during the quarter. 
Specifically, turning to Slide 6, our strategic growth areas account for 68% of Windstream's total revenue, and collectively, grew 2.5% year-over-year during second quarter. Business service revenue grew by 2%. Our business sales team is participating in many new sales opportunities as a result of our expanded network, robust product lineup and our personalized service, which has improved our competitive position. Consumer broadband service revenue grew by 4% year-over-year, a result of our focus on monetizing our industry-leading penetration by selling incremental broadband features and faster speed. Additionally, we are investing capital in growth initiatives that further improve our financial profile and offer attractive returns. 
Cost management is a core competency for Windstream, and we took steps in the second quarter to further improve our cost structure. We announced that we are restructuring our management organization to increase the efficiency of our decision-making and serve our customers more effectively. The reorganization is expected to yield $30 million to $40 million in annualized cost savings, primarily benefiting the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to achieve $50 million in synergies in 2012 related to the PAETEC acquisition. 
Our targeted acquisition strategy has strengthened Windstream. The power of a nationwide network is significantly enhancing our ability to win larger, multi-location enterprise deals, and our sophisticated product offerings and brand promise of personalized service are resonating very well. The PAETEC integration activities are on track, and we are making solid progress as a combined organization. 
In summary, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our plans. We see a clear path of growing free cash flow per share which will support our dividend well into the future. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our second quarter financial results."

Turning to Slide 7 where the second quarter Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.54 billion, operating income of $239 million and earnings per share of $0.09. Our results include approximately $12 million in after-tax",1277,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Turning to Slide 7 where the second quarter Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.54 billion, operating income of $239 million and earnings per share of $0.09. Our results include approximately $12 million in after-tax merger integration expense and $6 million in restructuring costs. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.12 in the second quarter. 
On Slide 8, Windstream generated pro forma revenue of $1.54 billion during the second quarter, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues grew by $18 million or 2%, consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Wholesale revenues declined $29 million or 12% year-over-year, and total product sales increased by $14 million or 26%. 
Within the business channel on Slide 9, data and integrated services grew by $28 million year-over-year or 8% due to growth in IP, next-generation data and data center services. Carrier revenue was up $7 million or 5% related to strong demand for increased capacity in wireless backhaul services. Business voice and long-distance revenues decreased by $20 million due to ongoing migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services.  Importantly, our business team has been achieving their sales targets, and we are well positioned to deliver on our plan for the remainder of the year.  Business product sales increased by $3 million or 8% as we saw an increase in enterprise-related product sales. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long-distance revenue declined by $14 million or 7% due to pure voice lines and declining feature packages. This is partially offset by growth in broadband revenues, which increased $4 million or 4%. With broadband penetration reaching 69% of primary consumer lines, we are focusing on improving customer ARPU by up-selling features, add-on services and faster broadband speed. 
Wholesale revenues declined by $12 million year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. First, Switched Access revenues decreased by $28 million due to traditional declines related to fewer access line and the modifications we made to certain PAETEC wholesale products last quarter. 
USF revenues increased by $4 million year-over-year driven by higher end-user pass-through surcharges. Wholesale voice and data revenue, which includes our traditional resell business, declined by $5 million due to fewer access line and lower usage. 
Sequentially, total service revenues decreased by $18 million or 1.2%. This was largely due to declines in the wholesale revenue related to changes to the PAETEC Switched Access products I just mentioned. As a reminder, we had $10 million revenues related to these products in the first quarter. We also had a sequential decline in business voice and long-distance revenue due to migration to integrated voice and data services. In addition, retail long-distance usage was higher in the first quarter and returned to a more consistent run rate during the second quarter. 
In the consumer channel, revenue declined by $1 million sequentially, which was an improvement from the roughly $4 million trend we have experienced over the last few quarters. 
On Slide 10, cash expenses improved by approximately $7 million or 1% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services increased by $9 million due to network growth and interconnection costs; increased data center costs due to growth and expansion; and higher pass-through federal USF surcharges, which were partially offset by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and other benefit costs. Cost of products sold increased by $13 million, consistent with better product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $29 million or 11% due to $12 million in incremental deal synergies and other cost management initiatives. 
Sequentially, cash expenses declined by $9 million or 1% related to incremental PAETEC synergies, declines in seasonal payroll taxes and other cost management initiatives, which were offset partially by an increase in seasonal operating expenses and higher product sales. 
For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $596 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. Sequentially, adjusted OIBDA increased by $2 million and the margin improved by 30 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we spent $267 million on capital expenditures, which included $70 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $7 million on broadband deployment related to stimulus projects. In addition, we spent $9 million of integration capital related to network optimization opportunities, which are part of our PAETEC integration plans. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the FCC established an interim $300 million Phase 1 Connect America Fund to further assist price cap carriers in deploying broadband to unserved locations of which Windstream was eligible for up to $60 million. Given the framework to accept this forward, combined with our already high broadband addressability, very few opportunities met our investment criteria. We accepted roughly $700,000 of the support under the current framework and also filed a waiver seeking to modify certain requirements, which would enable us to accept all of the funds and expand our broadband footprint. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $135 million during the second quarter, which was down $91 million year-over-year, while actual adjusted OIBDA grew by $86 million with the addition of PAETEC. This was offset by higher CapEx of $96 million and an increase in cash interest of $79 million, which was largely due to a shift in the timing of our interest payments due to our refinancing activities. Now, the majority of our interest payments fall within the second and fourth quarters whereas last year, the bulk of those payments were in the first and third quarters. For the first 6 months of 2012, we generated $487 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid out $294 million in dividends. During the second quarter, our working capital was a $15 million source of cash. 
Turning to Slide 12, we strengthened the balance sheet by amending our credit agreement in order to raise $900 million of additional proceeds, which we used to fully repay our outstanding revolver balance and create sufficient liquidity to refinance 2013 debt maturities. This transaction did not change our net leverage ratio and allows us to repay the 2013 debt maturities without further need to access the debt markets. 
We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.66x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to reducing net leverage to 3.2 to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA, and we'll make significant progress toward this goal next year as we permanently pay down a portion of the 2013 maturities, which will allow us to reach the top end of our targeted leverage ratio by the end of 2013. 
Turning to Slide 13, our plan for 2012 remains on track. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see sequential improvement in revenue and adjusted OIBDA, particularly in the fourth quarter related to enterprise sales success to date, incremental fiber installations, additional PAETEC synergies and the cost savings related to our ongoing reorganization efforts. Importantly, improvements that we expect in the back half of the year are based on activities that are well underway, and we are comfortable that we will achieve the low end -- the lower end of the revenue adjusted OIBDA guidance range that we provided in February. 
As we look to 2013 and beyond on Slide 14, we expect strong performance to drive growth in the business channel and continued stability in the consumer channel which, combined with the cost saving initiatives, should lead to adjusted OIBDA growth. These, together with significant reductions in capital spending and lower cash interest, position us very well to sustain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional shareholder friendly activities even with the expectation of higher cash taxes. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to provide more color on our operating results."

During the second quarter, business sales momentum remained strong, and our core services performed very well. We completed the rebranding efforts in the PAETEC markets and are seeing many benefits to operating as a combined company. We were successfully competing for large enterprise business customers and seeing positive results from our advanced service capabilities and personalized service.
We are differentiating Windstream by providing an integrated sales approach, which includes the collaboration of network engineers and dedicated product and data center specialists to customize solutions for business customers. We're equally focused on small business customers and are differentiating Windstream by offering innovative bundles that combine web hosting, design and maintenance with a full suite of voice and broadband services. We're seeing increased demand for data center co-location, cloud, and managed services from both large and small business customers. The carrier business continues to grow nicely driven by growing customer bandwidth needs and wireless backhaul. 
On Slide 16, consumer voice lines declined by approximately 24,000 in the second quarter and represented a 4.4% decline in total customers year-over-year. We had a net loss of high-speed Internet customers of 4,600, in part due to our high penetration of 69% of primary residential customers. We rebranded our consumer offerings in March to provide an innovative, entertainment bundle with our voice and high-speed Internet service and the Roku device, allowing customers to enhance their pay TV experience by streaming video content over the Internet. While this promotion draws better customer ARPU and enhances the utility of the broadband connection, the higher price point and traditional second quarter seasonality pressures contributed to slower sales. In the third quarter, we introduced revised pricing in order to increase sales trends. 
Turning to Slide 17, the PAETEC integration is proceeding in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we have integrated all functional workgroups and corporate systems and are operating as a combined sales and operations organization. The team is leveraging our full suite of products and services across a much larger customer base, and our nationwide network is providing increased sales opportunities, particularly to multi-location enterprises. 
The PAETEC billing conversion activities are underway and remain on track. We are very pleased with the milestones we have reached thus far and remain confident in our ability to achieve the targeted synergies and successfully integrate PAETEC. 
On Slide 18, we are making great progress on our capital initiatives planned for this year. To date, we completed fiber to over 1,500 towers and have around 2,100 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. As a reminder, we expect to reach between 4,000 and 5,000 towers both in and out of our ILEC footprint by the end of 2013, which will conclude the majority of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. We are also making investments in our broadband network to improve capacity and work is continuing on the broadband stimulus projects, which should add roughly 75,000 new addressable lines upon completion and provide a nice opportunity to further increase our broadband penetration. 
While our capital spend has elevated this year, beginning next year, we expect CapEx intensity to decline to a more normalized level of 11% to 13% of revenues as our fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. 
Thanks for your time this morning. We'll now take a few of your questions. Ali, please review the instructions and open the call up to questions. Thank you."

That 2% increase in business revenues year-over-year was lower sequentially than what we saw in Q1. When you start really looking through the details of that, most all the revenue trends look consistent with what you'd expect, but voice and LD is really where we saw a sequential decline of about $10 million in the second quarter. We kind of talked about it in the call because in Q1, what we really saw at that point was accelerated usage revenues that frankly just didn't continue in Q2. We saw Q2 trends revert back to what we had seen really in the Q3, Q4 time frame of last year. Not totally surprising, but that's really the biggest driver there. When you're talking about the difference between a 2% and a 3% growth, it's those little $3 million and $5 million swings that make a difference. And that's the big driver there, Michael."

And as you -- and as I alluded to my prepared remarks, we do expect that to ramp in the back half. We expect adjusted OIBDA to grow in 3Q and improve upon that into 4Q."

In the second quarter, there's a couple of things that are going on are worth explaining. First, seasonally, you tend to see slower sales in Q2 versus Q1, and that certainly was true for us. That slowdown was actually less on the gross ad side than we saw a year ago, but the overall volume was down which, as much as anything, is a function of our penetration, where we're seeing the lower sales to our existing customers. So for us, merge was all about increasing our prospects and really changing the dynamics of the discussion away from speed to the value of the entertainment package. That's what merge really was about. We saw early momentum, it slowed. The timing of that launch coincided with what I would define as more aggressive pricing action by our competition, and that definitely had an impact. That, coupled with seasonality and just the size of our base, is really what caused us to be slightly negative there. But we've kind of thought for a while for us given our penetration, it's not just about customer count, it's also about revenue growth. And so we've had and continue to have such a huge focus around those value-added services tied to that broadband product. And that's really what we're anchoring kind of the future growth of that franchise, too, not just customer growth. I did talk about the customer growth opportunity that we'll see which is largely tied to the stimulus projects we have underway whereby whenever we're ultimately completed and we will have passed 75,000 incremental new prospects we can kind of add to our list, Scott."

So Tony, I think that you -- when you're reading the script, you're saying or reiterating the low end of guidance, then you corrected yourself and said the lower end. We're in the middle of third quarter. You guys are kind of reiterating a number for EBITDA, that would be $2.43 billion or better. The consensus on the Street is actually tens of million below that, and it seems like if you're going to get to just very low end of the guidance number, you'd have to show up with kind of $620 million of EBITDA per quarter for the next 2 quarters in order to get there from where we were in the first half. So it's not just a slight acceleration, it's a pretty monumental acceleration, and obviously, the Street is skeptical that it can really be accomplished. So if you can kind of walk through the mechanics of where your conviction comes from that, that kind of acceleration is possible numerically would be really helpful. And then the second issue is going to be, as I think your average person probably doesn't understand the adjusted free cash flow, right, they're going to look at the cash flow statement and see that in the first half, you had operating cash flow of x, it was slightly higher than your CapEx and your dividends, and so the payout ratio looks like it's very, very high right now. Can you talk about how that is going to change in the second half? How does that dividend get more comfortable for you guys relative to the first half if I ignore the adjustments and just look at the cash flow statement?"

And let me start with your guidance question. As I alluded to, the sequential improvements we need to see in the back half of the year are really being driven by the increase in business service revenue, as well as the cost saving",558,"Great questions, David. And let me start with your guidance question. As I alluded to, the sequential improvements we need to see in the back half of the year are really being driven by the increase in business service revenue, as well as the cost saving initiatives. So when you look at the business service revenues, we looked into the funnel, we see what we have, as Brent alluded to, we know we're going to install here now, we have that better visibility into that in the third quarter, as well as the -- on the carrier business, our fiber-to-the-tower pipeline, we also get better visibility into what that is going to yield in the third quarter and beyond. So it's really just looking into our sales funnel and the conviction we have around our sales organization in terms of being able to deliver results in the back half of the year. And then on the cost management side, we've already taken the actions necessary to achieve a lot of our cost savings. We've already identified specific expense reductions we expect to make with regard to PAETEC in the back half of the year, and we've also -- we are also ramping up our management reorganization efforts into third quarter. So we've taken those actions, we have clear visibility into those cost savings, and that's really where we obtain our conviction is based on what we see today. But obviously, we need to execute and we need to continue to execute well in the back half of the year for us to achieve the lower end of our guidance range. And then your question on cash flow. We do use the adjusted free cash flow model because it excludes certain, really, just a few things, the few things it excludes are merger integration expenses, which are costs we incurred simply to integrate our acquisitions, and most of our costs here in the second quarter, as well as the first half of the year are related to PAETEC. And we do expect to continue to incur some M&I expenses in the back half of the year. And we're also -- we also exclude restructuring charges. And given the management reorganization that we're going through, we do expect to incur some onetime restructuring charges associated with that effort. And other item we exclude is working capital. But as we look to the back half of the year, I think there will be some pressure from M&I on the totality of the cash flow. But when you look beyond 2012 and into 2013, the M&I expense is significantly less, and we did not anticipate any significant restructuring expenses. So those are really discrete onetime items that are nonrecurring in nature. So I think ultimately, that's what gives us the confidence associated with the dividend payout ratio, plus just when we look into 2013, we were anticipating adjusted OIBDA growth. As we've talked a lot about, we expect the fiber-to-the-tower investments to start to weigh in, in '13 and we've taken some actions to improve our interest payments. I think, taken into totality, we're very comfortable with the cash flow generation capabilities of this company. And I think that will be more easily seen in 2013 than it is in 2012 simply due to the merger integration expenses we're incurring this year."

So when you look at the unsecured debt market, Windstream's debt yields are between 6% and 7% today, but in the term loan market, we were able to raise money at LIBOR plus 2 in a quarter and LIBOR plus 300. So those are very attractive rates. And by -- as you alluded to, by raising this money, we've completely freed up our revolver, so we have $1.25 billion revolver with no withdrawals on it. So as we look to our 2013 maturities, we are in a great position without having to go to the debt market today to completely pay off those debt maturities. So we are in a great spot. As we look into 2013, as we always do, we'll remain active in the capital markets and pick our times. But the real reason that I think we look to the term loan market was simply we are looking for ways to continue to lower our cash interest, as well as be able to find very attractive capital, and I think that's what we accomplished."

Some of the folks in our peer group are investment-grade, Windstream's is a high-yield company, so not surprisingly we have a marginally higher cost of debt, but a still very attractive overall cost of debt for a high-yield company as evidenced by the fact that we just went to market and closed on a transaction yesterday raising $900 million, $300 million of that at LIBOR 2.25% and $600 million of that at LIBOR plus 300 and the 1% floor.

So we're, I'd say, just over midway into our fiber-to-the-tower deployment. I talked a little bit about what we expect to happen through the back part of the year, where we still have about 2,100 towers under construction and the bulk of that will be completed late this year, mid-2013. As we look forward to next year and think about CapEx trends, in general, there's really 2 things that are happening next year. We do believe we should be substantially completing with the stimulus projects this year and then certainly make a major progress in terms of our fiber-to-the-tower construction efforts this year as well. The wind down of those 2 things alone could frankly reduce our CapEx next year by almost $200 million. Those are 2 big things that are happening next year that will make CapEx look different than 2012. And as we've talked about fiber-to-the-tower before, I mean, 60% to 70% of that effort is within our ILEC footprint. That effort was about retention, as well as growing that revenue stream because those deals are priced on a usage basis. The remaining part of that effort was all outside of our territory, which was a network expansion, and 100% of those revenues are incremental. And the combination of those 2 kind of parallel pass for us was about keeping that revenue trend in that mid-single-digit range we've experienced over the past 18 or so months of 5% to 7%, and that's really what we're targeting to make happen."

25090458,212273147,342255,"Windstream Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2012",2012-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by discussing the progress we are making on our strategic goals, Tony will review our financial performance and then Brent will discuss our operating results. Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaw",600,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin by discussing the progress we are making on our strategic goals, Tony will review our financial performance and then Brent will discuss our operating results. 
Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaways that I would like to emphasize today are: First, we are confident in our strategy and our business is performing well. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our 2012 plan. Next, we are driving profitable growth in our strategic areas of business and broadband through a combination of targeted acquisitions, our operational focus and success-based capital investments. At the same time, we continue to improve our cost structure. 
2012 is a peak CapEx year, driven by unique opportunities to grow organically with success-based capital investments. And coincidentally, these investments occur in a year with very favorable tax treatment. As we move into 2013 and beyond, capital will decline, and we expect to also benefit from lower cash interest and growth in adjusted OIBDA. As a result, Windstream is positioned to deliver sustainable and growing free cash flow. 
The dividend is a key component of our strategy. Yesterday, we declared our 25th consecutive dividend of $0.25 per quarter, and the cash generation capabilities of this business allow us to adequately invest in our network to support growth opportunities while paying the dividend well into the future. 
Turning to Slide 5. Windstream's long-term strategy is straightforward: Improve revenue, aggressively manage expenses and pursue targeted acquisitions, all with the goal of increasing free cash flow per share and in turn, creating shareholder value. We have made substantial improvements in our revenue mix and financial trends over the past 6 years by executing this strategy, and we continue to make progress during the quarter. 
Specifically, turning to Slide 6, our strategic growth areas account for 68% of Windstream's total revenue, and collectively, grew 2.5% year-over-year during second quarter. Business service revenue grew by 2%. Our business sales team is participating in many new sales opportunities as a result of our expanded network, robust product lineup and our personalized service, which has improved our competitive position. Consumer broadband service revenue grew by 4% year-over-year, a result of our focus on monetizing our industry-leading penetration by selling incremental broadband features and faster speeds. Additionally, we are investing capital in growth initiatives that further improve our financial profile and offer attractive returns. 
Cost management is a core competency for Windstream, and we took steps in the second quarter to further improve our cost structure. We announced that we are restructuring our management organization to increase the efficiency of our decision-making and serve our customers more effectively. The reorganization is expected to yield $30 million to $40 million in annualized cost savings, primarily benefiting the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to achieve $50 million in synergies in 2012 related to the PAETEC acquisition. 
Our targeted acquisition strategy has strengthened Windstream. The power of a nationwide network is significantly enhancing our ability to win larger, multi-location enterprise deals, and our sophisticated product offerings and brand promise of personalized service are resonating very well. The PAETEC integration activities are on track, and we are making solid progress as a combined organization. 
In summary, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to execute on our plans. We see a clear path of growing free cash flow per share which will support our dividend well into the future. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our second quarter financial results."

Turning to Slide 7 where the second quarter Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.54 billion, operating income of $239 million and earnings per share of $0.09.

Turning to Slide 7 where the second quarter Windstream achieved total revenue of $1.54 billion, operating income of $239 million and earnings per share of $0.09. Our results include approximately $12 million in after-tax merger integration expense and $6 million in restructuring costs. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.12 in the second quarter. 
On Slide 8, Windstream generated pro forma revenue of $1.54 billion during the second quarter, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Specifically, business service revenues grew by $18 million or 2%, consumer service revenues declined by $11 million or 3%. Wholesale revenues declined $29 million or 12% year-over-year, and total product sales increased by $14 million or 26%. 
Within the business channel on Slide 9, data and integrated services grew by $28 million year-over-year or 8% due to growth in IP, next-generation data and data center services. Carrier revenue was up $7 million or 5% related to strong demand for increased capacity in wireless backhaul services. Business voice and long-distance revenues decreased by $20 million due to ongoing migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services.  Importantly, our business team has been achieving their sales targets, and we are well positioned to deliver on our plan for the remainder of the year.  Business product sales increased by $3 million or 8% as we saw an increase in enterprise-related product sales. 
In the consumer channel, voice and long-distance revenue declined by $14 million or 7% due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages. This was partially offset by growth in broadband revenues, which increased $4 million or 4%. With broadband penetration reaching 69% of primary consumer lines, we are focusing on improving customer ARPU by up-selling features, add-on services and faster broadband speeds. 
Wholesale revenues declined by $12 million year-over-year, which was in line with our expectation. First, Switched Access revenues decreased by $28 million due to traditional declines related to fewer access line and to modifications we made to certain PAETEC wholesale products last quarter. 
USF revenues increased by $4 million year-over-year driven by higher end-user pass-through surcharges. Wholesale voice and data revenue, which includes our traditional resell business, declined by $5 million due to fewer access lines and lower usage. 
Sequentially, total service revenues decreased by $18 million or 1.2%. This was largely due to declines in the wholesale revenue related to changes to the PAETEC Switched Access products I just mentioned. As a reminder, we had $10 million in revenues related to these products in the first quarter. We also had a sequential decline in business voice and long-distance revenue due to migration to integrated voice and data services. In addition, retail long-distance usage was higher in the first quarter and returned to a more consistent run rate during the second quarter. 
In the consumer channel, revenue declined by $1 million sequentially, which was an improvement from the roughly $4 million trend we have experienced over the last few quarters. 
On Slide 10, cash expenses improved by approximately $7 million or 1% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services increased by $9 million due to network growth and interconnection costs; increased data center costs due to growth and expansion; and higher pass-through federal USF surcharges, which were partially offset by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and other benefit costs. Cost of products sold increased by $13 million, consistent with better product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $29 million or 11% due to $12 million in incremental deal synergies and other cost management initiatives. 
Sequentially, cash expenses declined by $9 million or 1% related to incremental PAETEC synergies, declines in seasonal payroll taxes and other cost management initiatives, which were offset partially by an increase in seasonal operating expenses and higher product sales. 
For the quarter, adjusted OIBDA was $596 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year and our adjusted OIBDA margin was 39%. Sequentially, adjusted OIBDA increased by $2 million and the margin improved by 30 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, we spent $267 million on capital expenditures, which included $70 million on fiber-to-the-tower investments and roughly $7 million on broadband deployment related to stimulus projects. In addition, we spent $9 million of integration capital related to network optimization opportunities, which are part of our PAETEC integration plans. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the FCC established an interim $300 million Phase 1 Connect America Fund to further assist price cap carriers in deploying broadband to unserved locations of which Windstream was eligible for up to $60 million. Given the framework to accept the support, combined with our already high broadband addressability, very few opportunities met our investment criteria. We accepted roughly $700,000 of the support under the current framework and also filed a waiver seeking to modify certain requirements, which would enable us to accept all of the funds and expand our broadband footprint. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $135 million during the second quarter, which was down $91 million year-over-year, while actual adjusted OIBDA grew by $86 million with the addition of PAETEC. This was offset by higher CapEx of $96 million and an increase in cash interest of $79 million, which was largely due to a shift in the timing of our interest payments due to our refinancing activities. Now the majority of our interest payments fall within the second and fourth quarters whereas last year, the bulk of those payments were in the first and third quarters. For the first 6 months 2012, we generated $487 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid out $294 million in dividends. During the second quarter, working capital was a $15 million source of cash. 
Turning to Slide 12, we strengthened the balance sheet by amending our credit agreement in order to raise $900 million of additional proceeds, which we used to fully repay our outstanding revolver balance and create sufficient liquidity to refinance 2013 debt maturities. This transaction did not change our net leverage ratio and allows us to repay the 2013 debt maturities without further need to access the debt markets. 
We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.66x adjusted OIBDA. We remain committed to reducing net leverage to 3.2x to 3.4x adjusted OIBDA, and we'll make significant progress towards this goal next year as we permanently pay down a portion of the 2013 maturities, which will allow us to reach the top end of our targeted leverage ratio by the end of 2013. 
Turning to Slide 13, our plan for 2012 remains on track. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see sequential improvement in revenue and adjusted OIBDA, particularly in the fourth quarter related to enterprise sales success to date, incremental fiber installations, additional PAETEC synergies and the cost savings related to our ongoing reorganization efforts. Importantly, improvements that we expect in the back half of the year are based on activities that are well underway, and we are comfortable that we will achieve the low end -- the lower end of the revenue-adjusted OIBDA guidance range that we provided in February. 
As we look to 2013 and beyond on Slide 14, we expect strong performance to drive growth in the business channel and continued stability in the consumer channel which, combined with the cost-saving initiatives, should lead to adjusted OIBDA growth. This, together with significant reductions in capital spending and lower cash interest, positioned us very well to sustain our dividend, deleverage the balance sheet and consider additional shareholder-friendly activities even with the expectation of higher cash taxes. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to provide more color on our operating results."

During the second quarter, business sales momentum remained strong, and our core services performed very well. We completed the rebranding efforts in the PAETEC markets and are seeing many benefits to operating as a combined company. We are successfully competing for large enterprise business customers and seeing positive results from our advanced service capabilities and personalized service.
We are differentiating Windstream by providing an integrated sales approach, which includes the collaboration of network engineers and dedicated product and data center specialists to customize solutions for business customers. We are equally focused on small business customers and are differentiating Windstream by offering innovative bundles that combine web hosting, design and maintenance with a full suite of voice and broadband services. We're seeing increased demand for data center co-location, cloud, and managed services from both large and small business customers. The carrier business continues to grow nicely, driven by growing customer bandwidth needs and wireless backhaul. 
On Slide 16, consumer voice lines declined by approximately 24,000 in the second quarter and represented a 4.4% decline in total customers year-over-year. We had a net loss of high-speed Internet customers of 4,600, in part due to our high penetration of 69% of primary residential customers. We rebranded our consumer offerings in March to provide an innovative entertainment bundle with our voice and high-speed Internet service and the Roku device, allowing customers to enhance their pay TV experience by streaming video content over the Internet. While this promotion draws better customer ARPU and enhances the utility of the broadband connection, the higher price point and traditional second quarter seasonality pressures contributed to slower sales. In the third quarter, we introduced revised pricing in order to increase sales trends. 
Turning to Slide 17, the PAETEC integration is proceeding in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we have integrated all functional workgroups and corporate systems and are operating as a combined sales and operations organization. The team is leveraging our full suite of products and services across a much larger customer base, and our nationwide network is providing increased sales opportunities, particularly to multi-location enterprises. 
The PAETEC billing conversion activities are underway and remain on track. We are very pleased with the milestones we have reached thus far and remain confident in our ability to achieve the targeted synergies and successfully integrate PAETEC. 
On Slide 18, we are making great progress on our capital initiatives planned for this year. To date, we completed fiber to over 1,500 towers and have around 2,100 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. As a reminder, we expect to reach between 4,000 and 5,000 towers both in and out of our ILEC footprint by the end of 2013, which will conclude the majority of our fiber-to-the-tower investments. We are also making investments in our broadband network to improve capacity and work is continuing on the broadband stimulus projects, which should add roughly 75,000 new addressable lines upon completion and provide a nice opportunity to further increase our broadband penetration. 
While our capital spend has elevated this year, beginning next year, we expect CapEx intensity to decline to a more normalized level of 11% to 13% of revenues as our fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. 
Thanks for your time this morning. We'll now take a few of your questions. Ali, please review the instructions and open the call up to questions. Thank you."

When you start really looking through the details of that, most all the revenue trends look consistent with what you'd expect, but voice and LD is really where we saw a sequential decline of about $10 million in the second quarter. We kind of talked about it in the call because in Q1, what we really saw at that point was accelerated usage revenues that frankly just didn't continue in Q2. We saw Q2 trends revert back to what we'd seen really in the Q3, Q4 time frame of last year. Not totally surprising, but that's really the biggest driver there.

I think if you look at what you've said today is expect sequential improvement in revenue and EBITDA, particularly in 4Q. So I just want to make sure I understand, are you expecting 3Q and 4Q revenue and EBITDA to be sort of above 2Q, and so we'll see sequential improvement each quarter from here on in or how to interpret that? And then, if you go back to the statement you made last quarter and piggybacking onto the last question, we had a growth of, I think, 3.2% in business services in 1Q and I think our expectation was that, that would improve in the back half of the year. Should we expect the improvement to come off of the 2% base or is that 3.2% business services revenue the base to grow off of?"

In the second quarter, there's a couple of things that are going on are worth explaining. First, seasonally, you tend to see slower sales in Q2 versus Q1, and that certainly was true for us. That slowdown was actually less on the gross add side than we saw a year ago, but the overall volume was down which, as much as anything, is a function of our penetration, where we're seeing the lower sales to our existing customers. So for us, merge was all about increasing our prospects and really changing the dynamics of the discussion away from speed to the value of the entertainment package. That's what merge really was about. We saw early momentum, it slowed. The timing of that launch coincided with what I would define as more aggressive pricing action by our competition, and that definitely had an impact. That, coupled with seasonality and just the size of our base, is really what caused us to be slightly negative there. But we've kind of thought for a while for us, given our penetration, it's not just about customer count, it's also about revenue growth. And so we've had and continue to have such a huge focus around those value-added services tied to that broadband product. And that's really what we're anchoring kind of the future growth of that franchise to, not just customer growth. I did talk about the customer growth opportunity that we'll see which is largely tied to the stimulus projects we have underway whereby whenever we're ultimately completed and we will have passed 75,000 incremental new prospects we can kind of add to our list, Scott."

So Tony, I think that you -- when you were reading the script, you were saying or reiterating the low end of guidance, then you corrected yourself and said the lower end. We're in the middle of third quarter. You guys are kind of reiterating a number for EBITDA that would be $2.43 billion or better. The consensus on the Street is actually 10s of millions below that, and it seems like if you're going to get to just very low end of the guidance number, you'd have to show up with kind of $620 million of EBITDA per quarter for the next 2 quarters in order to get there from where we were in the first half. So it's not just a slight acceleration, it's a pretty monumental acceleration. I mean obviously, the Street is skeptical that it can really be accomplished. So if you can kind of walk through the mechanics of where your conviction comes from that, that kind of acceleration is possible numerically, it would be really helpful. And then the second issue is going to be, as I think your average person probably doesn't understand the adjusted free cash flow, right. They're going to look at the cash flow statement and see that in the first half, you had operating cash flow of x, it was slightly higher than your CapEx and your dividends, and so the payout ratio looks like it's very, very high right now. Can you talk about how that is going to change in the second half? How does that dividend get more comfortable for you guys relative to the first half if I ignore the adjustments and just look at the cash flow statement?"

And let me start with your guidance question. As I alluded to, the sequential improvements we need to see in the back half of the year are really being driven by an increase in business service revenue, as well as the cost saving initiatives. So when you look at the business service revenues, we looked into the funnel, we see what we have, as Brent alluded to, we know what we're going to install here now, we have that better visibility into that in the third quarter, as well as the -- on the carrier business, our fiber-to-the-tower pipeline, we also get better visibility into what that is going to yield in the third quarter and beyond. So it's really just looking into our sales funnel and the conviction we have around our sales organization in terms of being able to deliver results in the back half of the year. And then on the cost management side, we've already taken the actions necessary to achieve a lot of our cost savings. We've already identified specific expense reductions we expect to make with regard to PAETEC in the back half of the year, and we've also -- we are also ramping up our management reorganization efforts into third quarter. So we've taken those actions, we have clear visibility into those cost savings, and that's really where we obtain our conviction is based off what we see today. But obviously, we need to execute and we need to continue to execute well in the back half of the year for us to achieve the lower end of our guidance range. And then your question on cash flow. We do use the adjusted free cash flow model because it excludes certain, really, just a few things. The few things it excludes are merger integration expenses, which are costs we incur simply to integrate our acquisitions, and most of our costs here in the second quarter, as well as the first half of the year are related to PAETEC. And we do expect to continue to incur some M&I expenses in the back half of the year. And we're also -- we also exclude restructuring charges. And given the management reorganization that we're going through, we do expect to incur some onetime restructuring charges associated with that effort. And other item we exclude is working capital. But as we look to the back half of the year, I think there will be some pressure from M&I on the totality of the cash flows. But when you look beyond 2012 and into 2013, the M&I expense is significantly less, and we do not anticipate any significant restructuring expenses. So those are really discrete onetime items that are nonrecurring in nature. So I think ultimately, that's what gives us the confidence associated with the dividend payout ratio, plus just when we look into 2013, we're anticipating adjusted OIBDA growth. As we've talked a lot about, we expect the fiber-to-the-tower investments to start to weigh in, in '13 and we've taken some actions to improve our interest payments. I think, taken in totality, we're very comfortable with the cash flow generation capabilities of this company. And I think that'll be more easily seen in 2013 than it is in 2012 simply due to the merger integration expenses we're incurring this year."

So when you look at the unsecured debt market, Windstream's debt yields are between 6% and 7% today, but in the term loan market, we were able to raise money at LIBOR plus 225 and LIBOR plus 300. So those are very attractive rates. And by -- as you alluded to, by raising this money, we've completely freed up our revolver, so we have $1.25 billion revolver with no draws on it. So as we look to our 2013 maturities, we are in a great position without having to go to the debt market today to completely pay off those debt maturities. So we are in a great spot. As we look into 2013, as we always do, we'll remain active in the capital markets and pick our times. But the real reason that I think we looked to the term loan market was simply we are looking for ways to continue to lower our cash interest, as well as be able to find very attractive capital, and I think that's what we accomplished."

As you alluded to, after we achieve our leverage goals, we'll have opportunity to put that cash to work in other ways, and Windstream has historically pursued share buybacks. That would definitely be one thing we would consider in the future, as well as we've used our cash for M&A activity. Both are pieces of our puzzle. But right now here in the immediate term, we're focused on reducing our leverage and getting inside that target leverage ratio."

And I wanted to ask about the Texas PUC, the rule that passed there.

We do expect to see revenue growth sequentially at both the service revenue and total revenue line from the second quarter into the third quarter and from 3Q into 4Q. And that's not surprising that we run basically a monthly recurring revenue model on our business service revenues with the exception of some long-distance usage trends that showed a little variability in the first quarter. If we achieve our monthly recurring revenue goals, that puts us in a very good position to go from 2Q into 3Q into 4Q. So as we look forward, that's really what's giving us our confidence and hopefully, that clarifies our view into revenues for the remainder of the year."

I talked a little bit about what we expect to happen through the back part of the year, where we still have about 2,100 towers under construction and the bulk of that will be completed late this year, mid-2013. As we look forward to next year and think about CapEx trends, in general, there's really 2 things that are happening next year. We do believe we should be substantially complete with the stimulus projects this year and then certainly making major progress in terms of our fiber-to-the-tower construction efforts this year as well. The wind down of those 2 things alone could frankly reduce our CapEx next year by almost $200 million. Those are 2 big things that are happening next year that'll make CapEx look different than 2012. And as we've talked about fiber-to-the-tower before, I mean, 60% to 70% of that effort is within our ILEC footprint. That effort was about retention, as well as growing that revenue stream because those deals are priced on a usage basis. The remaining part of that effort was all outside of our territory, which was a network expansion, and 100% of those revenues are incremental. And the combination of those 2 kind of parallel paths for us was about keeping that revenue trend in that mid-single-digit range we've experienced over the past 18 or so months of 5% to 7%, and that's really what we're targeting to make happen."

These results include approximately $7.8 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and $7.5 million in restructuring costs.

Before we get into the details, let me make a few comments. 2012 has been a solid year for Windstream from a strategic, operational and execution standpoint. We've made significant progress in integrating concept, increasing business sales productivity, improving our cost structure and investing in our network, all of which have advanced our core strategy. 
During the third quarter, we grew revenue and adjusted OIBDA sequentially. We expect further improvements during the fourth quarter. Earlier in of the year, we discontinued certain PAETEC wholesale product, which lowered our expected adjusted OIBDA by $37 million. We identified plans and help overcome this reduction and reach the low end of our guidance range. These plans have been completed and will result in permanent run rate improvements. 
During the third quarter, we saw increased promotional in the consumer channel and slow down in carrier revenues. As we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect considerable improvement in adjusted OIBDA sequentially, and now expect adjusted OIBDA for the full year to be in the range of $2.41 billion to $2.43 billion. Regardless of where we land in this range, results will be a decline in adjusted OIBDA of 1% or less, which is a solid outcome. 
Let's now turn to our third quarter result. Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaways that I would like to emphasize today are, first, we are confident in our strategy and our business is performing very well. We grew both revenue and adjusted OIBDA sequentially and expect continued momentum in the fourth quarter. 
Second, we saw solid performance in our business channel as a result of our strengths and capabilities, advanced solutions and nationwide network. We improved our cost structure, the management reorganization and incremental deal synergies. PAETEC integration remains on track. We are seeing many benefits to operating as a combined organization. 
Finally, we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives namely, fiber-to-the-tower and broadband stimulus projects. Importantly, the steps we were taking to position this business for continued success and I am confident in our ability to deliver strong, able, free cash flow support for our dividend, which is a key component of our investment thesis. And we believe it's the best way to provide returns to our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 5. Windstream strategy is based on 3 simple goals, which are leading, steady improvement in our results. This include growth strategic revenue, improve our cost structure and pursue strategic opportunities to further advance these goals. This strategy will produce stable and growing free cash flow in support of $1 dividend. 
Here's an update on our third quarter progress in each of these areas. Strategic revenue now represents 69% of our total revenue and grew 2.7% during the quarter. We have successfully repositioned the business in gross segments and fundamentally change the revenue trajectory resulting in better financial performance. We improved the cost structure for our reorganization efforts and achievement of the deal synergies during the quarter. Our focus on cost management has allowed us to maintain very steady margins throughout our transformation doing more business-centric company. Our targeted acquisition strategy has strengthened Windstream. PAETEC acquisition created a national footprint, which has improved our ability to win larger, multi-location business customer. Now a first-class business sales organization with advanced solution, expertise and network capability which are allowed us to gain market share and improve business revenue. 
Let me wrap up by saying I am confident in our strategy, which has driven steady improvements in our financial results over the past several years. We continue focusing on improving revenue trends, managing costs and pursuing strategic growth opportunity, all with the goal of providing long-term support for our dividend. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our financial results."

During the third quarter, Windstream generated revenue of $1.55 billion, a decrease of less than 1%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased by $15 million, which was the best sequential improvement we have seen today. Adjusted OIBDA was $603 million, a decrease of 1%. As expected, adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by $7 million, driven by continued synergy realization and other cost structure improvements. 
Turning to revenue by channel on Slide 7. Business service revenue was $906 million, up $24 million or 3%. Our business team continues to achieve their sales targets and sales incremental value-added services. Specifically, data and integrated services grew by $32 million or 9% due to growth in IP, next-generation data and data services. Carrier revenue increased $5 million or 3% related to fiber-to-the-tower installation, which was offset partially by slowdown carrier sales and increased glooming activities. 
Business voice and long-distance revenues decreased by $12 million due to ongoing migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services, offset somewhat by the implementation of higher end-user rates. 
In the consumer channel, service revenue was $335 million, down 3%. Voice and long-distance revenues declined $14 million or 7% due to fewer baseline and declining feature packages, which is partially offset by higher end-user rates. [indiscernible] revenue increased $4 million or 4%, due to growth in subscribers and sales of broadband features and faster speeds. 
Wholesale revenues were $220 million, down 10%. Intercarrier compensation reform was implemented on July 1, and the impact was in line with our expectations. Switched Access revenues decreased by $32 million due to lower interstate access rate and traditional decline in access lines, offset somewhat by carrier settlements and better usage trends during the quarter. USF revenues increased by $13 million due to new recoveries designed to mitigate the transition to lower intercarrier rate and higher end-user pass-through surcharges. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our business particularly in the business channel. 
On Slide 8, cash expenses decreased by approximately $6 million or 1%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $32 million or 5% due to network growth and interconnection, increased data center expenses due to growth and expansion, higher benefit costs and higher pass-through ESS surcharges. Cost of products sold increased by $5 million, consistent with higher product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $42 million or 16% due to $15 million in incremental deal synergies and other cost management initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 9, during the quarter, we spent $289 million on capital expenditures, comprised of $197 million core CapEx and $93 million in initiative CapEx, which includes fiber-to-the-tower investments and our portion to broadband stimulus investment. In addition, we spent $18 million in integration capital in order to PAETEC network authorization opportunity. 
Adjusted free cash flow was $182 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $669 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid up $441 million in dividend. During the third quarter, working capital was a use of cash due in part to higher accounts receivable driven by our stimulus budget receivables and the quarter end falling on a weekend, which impacted the receipt of payments, both of which is reversed. 
Turning to Slide 10, our debt maturity profile is well positioned with maturity staggered in a very natural way. We have roughly $1.1 billion of debt maturing in the third quarter 2013 and upgraded flexibility to refinance this with revolving borrowings should we choose to. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.7x adjusted OIBDA and plan to direct excess free cash flow to our debt pay down to bring us closer to our leverage range of 3.2 to 3.4x. 
Slide 11 provides a few more details on our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we have increased promotional activities during the third quarter, which we plan to continue in the fourth quarter. In addition, we also saw slowdown in carrier sales and increase in carrier grooming activity in our TDM network. The net results of these items will offset from the improvement we originally anticipated during the fourth quarter. Having said that, adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter should improve appreciably over the third quarter related to the momentum we are seeing in our business channel. incremental fiber installations, additional PAETEC synergies and roughly $10 million cost savings related to our reorganization efforts. 
Importantly, the investment thesis for Windstream remain the same. We produced very strong free cash flow and returned significant portion to our shareholders in a form of the dividend. Our strategy had resulted in stable and improving revenue and OIBDA trend, and we expect CapEx to decline for current levels beginning next year, all of which support our ability to continue paying a very attractive dividend to our shareholders for the long term. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to provide more color in our operating results"

Business sales momentum remains strong during the third quarter, led by sales in data and integrated services. Enterprise customers or customers who generate $750 or more in revenue per month grew 7% year-over-year. This was driven by improved ability to bring multi-location deals as a result of our nationwide network. 
We are generating higher ARPU plus selling additional offering such as cloud, EMA services, co-location, equipment and network services to name a few. With a small business customers, we are differentiating Windstream by creating innovative bundles that combine our voice and data offering with other men your services such as website design, hosting, and security. Our brand promise of smart solutions, personalized service is resonating across our business channel and business ARPU, excluding carrier revenues, grew 5%. Carrier circuits were up 3% due to fiber-to-the-tower installations, which were offset partially by slowdown in carrier sales and increased disconnects related to carrier grooming activities and migrations to our fiber network. 
On Slide 13, our consumer channel continued to deliver steady operational result. We added 6,000 new high-speed Internet customers, bringing our penetration of primary voice line to 70%. Given this high penetration, growing broadband units has become more challenging. 
During the third quarter, we increased our promotional activity to improve our success in switching cable customers, which we expect to continue during the fourth quarter. Consumer voice lines declined by approximately 22,000 and represented a 4.4% decline in total customers year-over-year. 
On Slide 14, our engineering team is making great progress on our capital initiatives this year. Through the end of the third quarter, we have installed fiber to over 2,100 towers and had around 1,900 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. We expect to reach between 4,000 and 5,000 towers, both in and out of our ILEC footprint. 
In the consumer markets, we are launching VDSL in 87 markets during the fourth quarter, which will enable roughly 45% of our customers to receive 10 to 12 mix speeds and 12% to receive 24 mix speeds, providing the opportunity to increase ARPU and improve our competitive edge. 
Additionally, work is continuing on the broadband stimulus projects, which should add roughly 75,000 new addressable lines upon completion and provide an opportunity to further increase our broadband penetration. While our capital spend has elevated this year. Beginning next year, we expect CapEx intensity to decline as the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. Excluding the initiative CapEx, our core CapEx intensity was below 13% during the third quarter. 
To wrap up, the Windstream team is focused on executing our strategy and performing well. We are seeing steady progress in our integration efforts, business sales momentum and capital initiatives.

And the breakdown of the $82 million relates to $13 million of merger integration. $12 million associated with our restructuring that we did in order to obtain $40 million and cost structure improvements and $18 million in integration CapEx.

We're going to stay away from 2013 guidance, but just with respect to -- if you look at -- if you look to our business and specifically related to our investments, I think the reason that we've begun breaking out our court CapEx versus our initiative CapEx this quarter is to show even this quarter we're in that range of 11% to 13%. And that's really what we expect that Windstream can run on a long-term basis. And so we remain comfortable with that. We delivered on that in the quarter. Our fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects both will end in 2013, and so we feel good about that. As it relates to the AT&T announcement, we too have been making investments all year to improve our competitiveness relative to the cable players in our markets to increase our speed. So I think directionally, they've got that right. And we feel good about where we are performing today in that segment. You can see that we picked up on some net gain versus the last quarter, albeit with some increased promotional activity as Brent referenced during his comments. But I think directionally, we're doing the right thing truly get the most bandwidth out of our network that we can today and be competitive as possible."

First of all, we had a plan with initiatives that we believe would allow us to reach $2.43 billion. I think that's what you're referring to on our last call. However, we've had some headwinds come up that will offset some of the expected benefits that give us some pause in terms of whether we can get all the way there. We're still doing everything we can to get there. Initiatives have been achieved. So we've done everything that we said we were going to do and they resulted in nice improvement in the business, which we will continue in our run rate going forward, so they're permanent. During the quarter, specifically, we saw promotional pressures in the consumer channel and a slowdown in carrier revenues. As we look to 4Q, and much of that happened later in the third quarter, and so that's what affected our view of the range that a gave earlier. As we look to 4Q, we continue to expect considerable improvement adjusted OIBDA sequentially. And as I said, our current view is that we'll come in between 2.41 and 2.43. Regardless of where we end, our land in this range, there's about the 1% decline, which is a very solid outcome. And importantly, I think as investors are concerned about the dividend is secure, whether we come in at 24 15 or 24 30, it really doesn't affect our view on the dividend with respect to 2013 and beyond. We're just -- we're seeing some temporary pressure and working very, very hard to overcome that. We can talk about some tailwinds that we have in the fourth quarter that lead to our confidence about our ability to improve our OIBDA sequentially. And those are, first of all, it will be the first full quarter of the complete savings from our reorganization, so $10 million there. Very proud of what we're seeing in the business channel as other -- some others in the industry have been reported some top results on the business side. As Brent said, our strategy is continuing to resonate in the market and our business channels continuing to hit their sales quotas. We've got a considerable amount of fiber-to-the-tower installations going in the fourth quarter, which will help offset some of that carrier pressure that we talked about. We've got some additional PAETEC synergies. And finally, just as we look through the fourth quarter over the years, seasonally, we have lower costs. And the headwinds, as we said earlier, our carrier grooming on the TDM network and more investment consumer promotions. I'll let Brent give some more color on those specific headwinds that might help you better understand that."

On the carrier side, really, there's a couple of things as I mentioned, one, is we turned out towers and we've been working hard to deliver the speed of disconnects of the old access there was very fast. I that happened during the quarter. In addition, we saw a couple of states where we have lost that business. Those disconnects when those other competitive turned to our customers came in the quarter much quicker than we thought might happen. The second thing we're seeing and to just point, a little consistent from what we're seeing in others, I mean, our carriers customers to their retail base slow and that resulted in fewer carrier sales as well, below the run rate we've seen earlier in the year. But we stepped back and look the carrier overall, it's still grew 5% year-to-date. And we've got momentum on delivery of our new fiber-to-the-towers and continued GAAP conviction around wireless data usage and but that's going to be for the future. In terms of the consumer side, we talked last time when we are slightly net negative on Broadband add in the second quarter at that we are stepping up our investments in the third quarter. And we really did that. I mean, that resulted in lower pricing and a little higher, for us, first month bill credit to offset some of the cost our customers experience when they switched to Windstream. And that was reflected in our consumer business. But we felt we had to do that. And as you see in our broadband net, we showed a 10,000-unit net improvement from Q2 versus Q3, so that resonated the marketplace and it's just Frank a more competitive space that if. If we retain our share and grow, we needed to respond and we're happy that our team did just that."

We've got a lot of technology improvement happening in 2013, that will help us with that.

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, supplemental pro forma results and our third quarter earnings presentation are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Today's discussion include certain forward-looking statements. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings. This describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. The presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to cover a few items upfront. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.09 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include approximately $7.8 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and $7.5 million in restructuring costs. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.12 for the quarter. Discussion of our results and growth rates for the remainder of this presentation exclude these non-operational items.
We have provided supplemental pro forma financial results that include the PAETEC business for all periods shown. This quarter, we have provided enhanced business operating disclosures, which include PAETEC and presents total business customer locations segmented by enterprise and small business, as well as carrier special access circuits.
In addition, we are separately disclosing our initiative capital expenditures, which include fiber-to-the-tower investments and our portion of the broadband stimulus investment. I'd also like to point out that the quarterly growth rates discussed today are presented on a pro forma, year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.
Beginning on Slide 3, participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss the progress we're making on our strategic goals; Tony Thomas, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, who will provide the financial update; and Brent Whittington, Windstream's Chief Operating Officer, who will give an operational update. At the end of our presentation, we will take a few questions.
With that, here's Jeff Gardner."

Before we get into the details, let me make a few comments. 2012 has been a solid year for Windstream from a strategic, operational and execution standpoint.

Before we get into the details, let me make a few comments. 2012 has been a solid year for Windstream from a strategic, operational and execution standpoint. We've made significant progress on integrating PAETEC, increasing business sales productivity, improving our cost structure and investing in our network, all of which have advanced our core strategy.
During the third quarter, we grew revenue and adjusted OIBDA sequentially and expect further improvements during the fourth quarter. Earlier in the year, we discontinued certain PAETEC wholesale products, which lowered our expected adjusted OIBDA by $37 million. We identified plans to help overcome this reduction and reach the low end of our guidance range. These plans have been completed and will result in permanent run rate improvement.
During the third quarter, we saw increased promotional pressures in the consumer channel and a slow down in carrier revenues. As we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect considerable improvement in adjusted OIBDA sequentially, and now expect adjusted OIBDA for the full year to be in the range of $2.41 billion to $2.43 billion. Regardless of where we land in this range, the results will be a decline in adjusted OIBDA of 1% or less, which is a solid outcome.
Let's now turn to our third quarter result. Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaways that I would like to emphasize today are: First, we are confident in our strategy and our business is performing very well. We grew both revenue and adjusted OIBDA sequentially and expect continued momentum in the fourth quarter. 
Second, we saw solid performance in our business channel as a result of our strengths and capabilities, advanced solutions and nationwide network. We improved our cost structure with a management reorganization and incremental deal synergies. The PAETEC integration remains on track and we are seeing many benefits to operating as a combined organization.
Finally, we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives namely, fiber-to-the-tower and broadband stimulus projects. Importantly, the steps we were taking position this business for continued success and I am confident in our ability to deliver strong, stable, free cash flow support to our dividend, which is a key component of our investment thesis. And we believe is the best way to provide returns to our shareholders.
Moving to Slide 5. Windstream strategy is based on 3 simple goals, which are leading to steady improvements in our results. These include grow strategic revenue, improve our cost structure and pursue strategic opportunities to further advance these goals. This strategy will produce stable and growing free cash flow and support our $1 dividend.
Here's an update on our third quarter progress in each of these areas. Strategic revenue now represents 69% of our total revenue and grew 2.7% during the quarter. We have successfully repositioned the business in growth segments and fundamentally changed the revenue trajectory resulting in better financial performance.
We improved the cost structure through our reorganization efforts and achievement of the deal synergies during the quarter. Our focus on cost management has allowed us to maintain very steady margins throughout our transformation to a more business-centric company.
Our targeted acquisition strategy has strengthened Windstream. The PAETEC acquisition created a national footprint, which has improved our ability to win larger, multi-location business customers, build a first-class business sales organization, with advanced solution, expertise and network capability, which are allowing us to gain market share and improve business revenues.
Let me wrap up by saying that I am confident in our strategy, which has driven steady improvements in our financial results over the past several years. We continue focusing on improving revenue trends, managing costs and pursuing strategic growth opportunities, all with the goal of providing long-term support for our dividend.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our financial results."
25090458,222660769,381657,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2012",2012-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin on Slide 6 with a few financial highlights that demonstrate we are effectively executing our strategy and delivering improving financial results. During the third quarter, Windstream generated revenue of $1.",855,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin on Slide 6 with a few financial highlights that demonstrate we are effectively executing our strategy and delivering improving financial results. During the third quarter, Windstream generated revenue of $1.55 billion, a decrease of less than 1%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased by $15 million, which was the best sequential improvement we have seen today. Adjusted OIBDA was $603 million, a decrease of 1%. As expected, adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by $7 million, driven by continued synergy realization and other cost structure improvements.
Turning to revenue by channel on Slide 7. Business service revenue was $906 million, up $24 million or 3%. Our business team continues to achieve their sales targets and sell incremental value-added services. Specifically, data and integrated services grew by $32 million or 9%, due to growth in IP, next-generation data and data center services. Carrier revenue increased $5 million or 3%, related to fiber-to-the-tower installations, which was offset partially by a slowdown in carrier sales and increased grooming activities.
Business voice and long-distance revenue decreased by $12 million, due to ongoing migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services, offset somewhat by the implementation of higher end-user rates.
In the consumer channel, service revenue was $335 million, down 3%. Voice and long-distance revenues declined $14 million or 7%, due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which are partially offset by higher end-user rates. Broadband revenue increased $4 million or 4%, due to growth in subscribers and sales of broadband features and faster speeds.
Wholesale revenues were $220 million, down 10%. Intercarrier compensation reform was implemented on July 1, and the impact was in line with our expectations. Switched Access revenues decreased by $32 million, due to lower interstate access rates and traditional declines in access lines, offset somewhat by carrier settlements and better usage trends during the quarter. USF revenues increased by $13 million due to new recoveries designed to mitigate the transition to lower intercarrier rate and higher end-user pass-through surcharges. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our business, particularly in the business channel.
On Slide 8, cash expenses decreased by approximately $6 million or 1%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $32 million or 5%, due to network growth and interconnection, increased data center expenses due to growth and expansion, higher benefit costs and higher pass-through federal USF surcharges. Cost of products sold increased by $5 million, consistent with higher product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $42 million or 16%, due to $15 million incremental deal synergies and other cost management initiatives.
Turning to Slide 9, during the quarter, we spent $289 million on capital expenditures, comprised of $197 million core CapEx and $93 million in initiative CapEx, which includes fiber-to-the-tower investments and our portion of broadband stimulus investment. In addition, we spent $18 million in integration capital related to PAETEC's network optimization opportunities.
Adjusted free cash flow was $182 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $669 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid up $441 million in dividend. During the third quarter, working capital was a use of cash, due in part to higher accounts receivable, driven by our stimulus budget receivables and the quarter end falling on a weekend, which impacted the receipt of payments, both of which is reversed.
Turning to Slide 10, our debt maturity profile is well positioned, with maturity staggered in a very manageable way. We have roughly $1.1 billion of debt maturing in the third quarter of 2013 and have created the flexibility to refinance this with revolver borrowings should we choose to. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.7x adjusted OIBDA and plan to direct excess free cash flow towards debt pay down to bring us closer to a leverage range of 3.2 to 3.4x.
Slide 11 provides a few more details on our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we had increased promotional activity during the third quarter, which we plan to continue in the fourth quarter. In addition, we also saw a slowdown in carrier sales and an increase in carrier grooming activity on our TDM network. The net results of these items will offset from the improvement we originally anticipated during the fourth quarter. Having said that, adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter should improve appreciably over the third quarter related to the momentum we are seeing in our business channel. Incremental fiber installations, additional PAETEC synergies and roughly $10 million cost savings related to our reorganization efforts.
Importantly, the investment thesis for Windstream remains the same. We produced a very strong free cash flow and returned a significant portion of it to our shareholders in the form of a dividend. Our strategy has resulted in stable and improving revenue and OIBDA trend, and we expect CapEx to decline from current levels beginning next year, all of which support our ability to continue paying a very attractive dividend to our shareholders for the long term.
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to provide more color on our operating results."

The business sales momentum remains strong during the third quarter, led by sales in data and integrated services. Enterprise customers or customers who generate $750 or more in revenue per month grew 7% year-over-year. This was driven by our improved ability to win multi-location deals as a result of our nationwide network.
We are generating higher ARPU by selling additional offerings such as cloud and managed services, co-location, equipment and network services to name a few. With small business customers, we are differentiating Windstream by creating innovative bundles that combine our voice and data offering with other main services such as website design, hosting, and security. Our brand promise of smart solutions, personalized service is resonating across our business channel and business ARPU, excluding carrier revenues, grew 5%. Carrier circuits were up 3% due to fiber-to-the-tower installations, which were offset partially by a slowdown in carrier sales and increased disconnects related to carrier grooming activities and migrations to our fiber network.
On Slide 13, our consumer channel continued to deliver steady operational results. We added 6,000 new high-speed Internet customers, bringing our penetration of primary voice lines to 70%. Given this high penetration, growing broadband units has become more challenging.
During the third quarter, we increased our promotional activity to improve our success in switching cable customers, which we expect to continue during the fourth quarter. Consumer voice lines declined by approximately 22,000 and represented a 4.4% decline in total customers year-over-year.
On Slide 14, our engineering team is making great progress on our capital initiatives this year. Through the end of the third quarter, we have installed fiber to over 2,100 towers and had around 1,900 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. We expect to reach between 4,000 and 5,000 towers, both in and out of our ILEC footprint. 
In the consumer markets, we are launching VDSL in 87 markets during the fourth quarter, which will enable roughly 45% of our customers to receive 10 to 12 meg speeds and 12% to receive 24 meg speeds, providing the opportunity to increase ARPU and improve our competitiveness.
Additionally, work is continuing on the broadband stimulus projects, which should add roughly 75,000 new addressable lines upon completion and provide an opportunity to further increase our broadband penetration. While our capital spend has elevated this year. Beginning next year, we expect CapEx intensity to decline as the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. Excluding the initiative CapEx, our core CapEx intensity was below 13% during the third quarter.
To wrap up, the Windstream team is focused on executing our strategy and performing well. We are seeing steady progress in our integration efforts, business sales momentum and capital initiatives.
Thanks for your time this morning. We'll now take a few of your questions. Kevin, if you could please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

The difference in the third quarter was $83 million. Importantly, the items that make up that difference are temporary items and will disappear specifically related to the integration. And the breakdown of the $82 million relates to $13 million of merger integration. $12 million associated with our restructuring that we did in order to obtain $40 million in cost structure improvements and $18 million in integration CapEx. There was also some working capital used within the quarter of roughly $40 million, of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. So I look at those differences, importantly, we think those are temporary, specifically associated with our integration activities with PAETEC, or more temporary in nature. And as you look to 2013 obviously, our integration will be more complete and we expect incur substantially less charges going forward."

We're going to stay away from 2013 guidance, but just with respect to -- if you look at -- if you look to our business and specifically related to our investments, I think the reason that we began breaking out our core CapEx versus our initiative CapEx this quarter is to show even this quarter we're in that range of 11% to 13%. And that's really what we expect that Windstream can run on, on a long-term basis. And so we remain comfortable with that. We delivered on that in the quarter. Our fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects both will end in 2013, and so we feel good about that. As it relates to the AT&T announcement, we too have been making investments all year to improve our competitiveness relative to the cable players in our markets to increase our speed. So I think directionally, they've got that right. And we feel good about where we are performing today in that segment. You can see that we picked up some net gain versus the last quarter, albeit with some increased promotional activity as Brent referenced during his comments. But I think directionally, we're doing the right thing to really get the most bandwidth out of our network that we can today and be competitive as possible."

First of all, we had a plan with initiatives that we believe would allow us to reach $2.43 billion. I think that's what you're referring to on our last call. However, we've had some headwinds come up that will offset some of the expected benefits that gave us some pause in terms of whether we can get all the way there. We're still doing everything we can to get there. Initiatives have been achieved. So we've done everything that we said we were going to do and they've resulted in nice improvements in the business, which we will continue in our run rate going forward, so they're permanent. During the quarter, specifically, we saw promotional pressures in the consumer channel and a slowdown in carrier revenues. As we look to 4Q, and much of that happened later in the third quarter, and so that's what affected our view of the range that I gave earlier. As we look to 4Q, we continue to expect considerable improvement in adjusted OIBDA sequentially. And as I said, our current view is that we'll come in between 2.41 and 2.43. Regardless of where we end or land in this range, it's about a 1% decline, which is a very solid outcome. And importantly, I think as investors are concerned about, the dividend is secure, whether we come in at 24.15 or 24.30, it really doesn't affect our view on the dividend with respect to 2013 and beyond. We're just -- we're seeing some temporary pressure and working very, very hard to overcome that. We can talk about some tailwinds that we have in the fourth quarter that lead to our confidence about our ability to improve our OIBDA sequentially. And those are, first of all, it will be the first full quarter of the complete savings from our reorganization, so $10 million there. Very proud of what we're seeing in the business channel. As other -- some others in the industry have been reported some tough results on the business side, as Brent said, our strategy is continuing to resonate in the market and our business channels continuing to hit their sales quotas. We've got a considerable amount of fiber-to-the-tower installations going in the fourth quarter, which will help offset some of that carrier pressure that we talked about. We've got some additional PAETEC synergies. And finally, just as we look through the fourth quarter over the year, seasonally, we have lower costs. And the headwinds, as we said earlier, our carrier grooming on the TDM network and more aggressive consumer promotions. I'll let Brent give some more color on those specific headwinds that might help you better understand that."

One, is we turned up towers that we've been working hard to deliver. The speed of disconnects to the old copper access there was very fast, and that happened during the quarter. In addition, we saw in a couple of states where we had lost that business. Those disconnects when those other competitive providers turned up fiber to our customers came in the quarter much quicker than we thought might happen. The second thing we've seen and to just point, a little consistent with what we've seen from others in softness in sales. I mean, our carrier customers have seen sales to their retail base slow and that resulted in fewer carrier sales in the quarter as well, below the run rate we've seen earlier in the year. But we stepped back and look at the carrier overall, but still grown 5% year-to-date. And we've got momentum on delivery of our new fiber towers and continue to have conviction around wireless data usage and what that's going to mean for the future. In terms of the consumer side, we talked last time when we are slightly net negative on broadband add in the second quarter, that we are stepping up our aggressiveness in the third quarter. And we really did that. I mean, that resulted in lower pricing and a little higher, for us, first month bill credit to offset some of the cost our customers experienced when they switched to Windstream. And that was reflected in our consumer business. But we felt we had to do that. And as you see in our broadband net add, we showed a 10,000-unit net improvement from Q2 versus Q3, so that message resonated in the marketplace and it's just frankly a more competitive space and if we're going to retain our share and grow, we needed to respond and I'm happy when our team did just that."

And then with regard to the churn activity, the promotional activity in the broadband business, how is that lined up in the past? What is sort of the long-term churn for that, if you sign up a customer on a promotion, 6-month promotion or whatever it is, what sort of the stickiness, what percentage of those customers stay after the promotion is off. Or you do end up capturing a lot of switchers other than just flip in for a free deal? How should we think about the -- over the next 12 months, these customers that you brought on, if they're going to be around?"

And so we're constantly working from everything with -- from our interconnection costs to our efficiencies in terms of things like service delivery. We've got a lot of technology improvement happening in 2013 that will help us with that. But fundamentally, we're confident that we can continue to grow our business services with the targeted capital intensity of 11% to 13%, work on somebody's cost initiatives to get the kind of operating leverage that you're talking about. We've got a fairly unique model, which I think that everybody's struggling like with a little bit. We don't look exactly like Time Warner Telecom and we don't look like an RLEC. Our CLEC strategy uses an efficient capital deployment process where we use a combination of network options, including leveraging the significant amount of fiber that we have today, making new success-based capital investments and in some cases, leasing last-mile facilities. So I think that's fairly unique. But when you take everything as a whole, we feel confident in our ability to continue to improve the operating margins in the CLEC business. That's what we're betting on in the long term. We see a path there. We've been making improvements sequentially and expect that to continue into '13 and beyond."

And finally, we do expect Switched Access decline to drop in 4Q as they do through normal seasonality. But importantly, the wholesale business is now a shrinking part of Windstream.

The question was really the speed at which that would be disconnected. And as we've seen, once we turn up the networks, we're doing all the testing, they are built to be redundant, they're working as planned, and those copper discos are following very quickly thereafter. So over 2013 is my expectation there. In terms of the network expenses, PAETEC was doing some work to connect those networks. You were right, they weren't fully integrated. They were working to continue that effort, along with the connectivity to our own network. That's not something that happens in a short period of time and that's something that's underway as we speak today, and will continue for at least the next 2 to 3 years.

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, supplemental pro forma results and our third quarter earnings presentation are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Today's discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. The presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to cover a few items upfront. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.09 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include approximately $7.8 million in after-tax merger and integration expense and $7.5 million in restructuring costs. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.12 for the third quarter. Discussion of our results and growth rates for the remainder of this presentation exclude these non-operational items.
We have provided supplemental pro forma financial results that include the PAETEC business for all periods shown. This quarter, we have provided enhanced business operating disclosures, which include PAETEC and present total business customer locations segmented by enterprise and small business, as well as carrier special access circuits.
In addition, we are separately disclosing our initiative capital expenditures, which include fiber-to-the-tower investments and our portion of the broadband stimulus investments. I'd also like to point out that the quarterly growth rates discussed today are presented on a pro forma, year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.
Beginning on Slide 3, participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will discuss the progress we're making on our strategic goals; Tony Thomas, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, who will provide a financial update; and Brent Whittington, Windstream's Chief Operating Officer, who will give an operational update. At the end of our presentation, we will take a few questions.
With that, here's Jeff Gardner."

Before we get into the details, let me make a few comments. 2012 has been a solid year for Windstream from a strategic, operational and execution standpoint. We have made significant progress on integrating PAETEC,",643,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me make a few comments. 2012 has been a solid year for Windstream from a strategic, operational and execution standpoint. We have made significant progress on integrating PAETEC, increasing business sales productivity, improving our cost structure and investing in our network, all of which have advanced our core strategy.
During the third quarter, we grew revenue and adjusted OIBDA sequentially and expect further improvements during the fourth quarter. Earlier in the year, we discontinued certain PAETEC wholesale products, which lowered our expected adjusted OIBDA by $37 million. We identified plans to help overcome this reduction and reached the low end of our guidance range. These plans have been completed and will result in permanent run rate improvement.
During the third quarter, we saw increased promotional pressures in the consumer channel and a slowdown in carrier revenues. As we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect considerable improvement in adjusted OIBDA sequentially, and now expect adjusted OIBDA for the full year to be in the range of $2.41 billion to $2.43 billion. Regardless of where we land in this range, the result will be a decline in adjusted OIBDA of 1% or less, which is a solid outcome.
Let's now turn to our third quarter result. Beginning on Slide 4, the key takeaways that I would like to emphasize today are: First, we are confident in our strategy and our business is performing very well. We grew both revenue and adjusted OIBDA sequentially and expect continued momentum in the fourth quarter. 
Second, we saw solid performance in our business channel as a result of our strengthened capabilities, advanced solutions and nationwide network. We improved our cost structure with a management reorganization and incremental deal synergies. The PAETEC integration remains on track and we are seeing many benefits to operating as a combined organization.
Finally, we continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives, namely fiber-to-the-tower and broadband stimulus projects. Importantly, the steps we were taking position this business for continued success and I am confident in our ability to deliver strong, stable free cash flow support to our dividend, which is a key component of our investment thesis, and we believe is the best way to provide returns to our shareholders.
Moving to Slide 5. Windstream's strategy is based on 3 simple goals, which are leading to steady improvements in our results. These include grow strategic revenue, improve our cost structure and pursue strategic opportunities to further advance these goals. This strategy will produce stable and growing free cash flow and support our $1 dividend.
Here's an update on our third quarter progress in each of these areas. Strategic revenue now represents 69% of our total revenue and grew 2.7% during the quarter. We have successfully repositioned the business in growth segments and fundamentally changed the revenue trajectory resulting in better financial performance.
We improved the cost structure through our reorganization efforts and achievement of the deal synergies during the quarter. Our focus on cost management has allowed us to maintain very steady margins throughout our transformation to a more business-centric company.
Our targeted acquisition strategy has strengthened Windstream. The PAETEC acquisition created a national footprint, which has improved our ability to win larger, multi-location business customers, build a first-class business sales organization, with advanced solutions, expertise and network capability, which are allowing us to gain market share and improve business revenues.
Let me wrap up by saying that I am confident in our strategy, which has driven steady improvements in our financial results over the past several years. We continue focusing on improving revenue trends, managing costs and pursuing strategic growth opportunities, all with the goal of providing long-term support for our dividend.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will discuss our financial results."
25090458,222660769,381826,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2012",2012-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin on Slide 6 with a few financial highlights that demonstrate we are effectively executing our strategy and delivering improving financial results. During the third quarter, Windstream generated revenue of $1.",857,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin on Slide 6 with a few financial highlights that demonstrate we are effectively executing our strategy and delivering improving financial results. During the third quarter, Windstream generated revenue of $1.55 billion, a decrease of less than 1%. On a sequential basis, revenue increased by $15 million, which was the best sequential improvement we have seen today. Adjusted OIBDA was $603 million, a decrease of 1%. As expected, adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by $7 million, driven by continued synergy realization and other cost structure improvements.
Turning to revenue by channel on Slide 7. Business service revenue was $906 million, up $24 million or 3%. Our business team continues to achieve their sales targets and sell incremental value-added services. Specifically, data and integrated services grew by $32 million or 9%, due to growth in IP, next-generation data and data center services. Carrier revenue increased $5 million or 3%, related to fiber-to-the-tower installations, which was offset partially by a slowdown in carrier sales and increased grooming activities. Business voice and long-distance revenue decreased by $12 million, due to ongoing migrations from traditional voice services to integrated voice and data services, offset somewhat by the implementation of higher end-user rates.
In the consumer channel, service revenue was $335 million, down 3%. Voice and long-distance revenues declined $14 million or 7%, due to fewer voice lines and declining feature packages, which are partially offset by higher end-user rates. Broadband revenue increased $4 million or 4%, due to growth in subscribers and sales of broadband features and faster speeds.
Wholesale revenues were $220 million, down 10%. Intercarrier compensation reform was implemented on July 1, and the impact was in line with our expectations. Switched Access revenues decreased by $32 million, due to lower intrastate access rates and traditional declines in access lines, offset somewhat by carrier settlements and better usage trends during the quarter. USF revenues increased by $13 million due to new recoveries designed to mitigate the transition to lower intercarrier rates and higher end-user pass-through surcharges. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our business, particularly in the business channel.
On Slide 8, cash expenses decreased by approximately $6 million or 1%. Specifically, cost of services increased by $32 million or 5%, due to network growth and interconnection, increased data center expenses due to growth and expansion, higher benefit costs and higher pass-through federal USF surcharges. Cost of products sold increased by $5 million, consistent with higher product sales. SG&A expenses decreased $42 million or 16%, due to $15 million in incremental deal synergies and other cost management initiatives.
Turning to Slide 9, during the quarter, we spent $289 million on capital expenditures, comprised of $197 million core CapEx and $93 million in initiative CapEx, which includes fiber-to-the-tower investments and our portion of the broadband stimulus investment. In addition, we spent $18 million in integration capital related to PAETEC network optimization opportunities.
Adjusted free cash flow was $182 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $669 million in adjusted free cash flow and paid out $441 million in dividends. During the third quarter, working capital was a use of cash, due in part to higher accounts receivable, driven by our stimulus project receivables and the quarter end falling on a weekend, which impacted the receipt of payments, both of which should reverse.
Turning to Slide 10, our debt maturity profile is well positioned, with maturities staggered in a very manageable way. We have roughly $1.1 billion of debt maturing in the third quarter of 2013 and have created the flexibility to refinance this with revolver borrowings, should we choose to. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 3.7x adjusted OIBDA and plan to direct excess free cash flow towards debt pay down to bring us closer to a leverage range of 3.2x to 3.4x.
Slide 11 provides a few more details on our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we had increased promotional activity during the third quarter, which we plan to continue in the fourth quarter. In addition, we also saw a slowdown in carrier sales and an increase in carrier grooming activity on our TDM network. The net results of these items will offset from the improvement we originally anticipated during the fourth quarter. Having said that, adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter should improve appreciably over the third quarter related to the momentum we are seeing in our business channel. Incremental fiber installations, additional PAETEC synergies and roughly $10 million cost savings related to our reorganization efforts.
Importantly, the investment thesis for Windstream remains the same. We produce a very strong free cash flow and returned a significant portion of it to our shareholders in the form of a dividend. Our strategy has resulted in stable and improving revenue and OIBDA trend, and we expect CapEx to decline from current levels beginning next year, all of which support our ability to continue paying a very attractive dividend to our shareholders for the long term.
With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to provide more color on our operating results."

Turning to Slide 12. The business sales momentum remained strong during the third quarter, led by sales in data and integrated services. Enterprise customers or customers who generate $750 or more in revenue per m",495,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. The business sales momentum remained strong during the third quarter, led by sales in data and integrated services. Enterprise customers or customers who generate $750 or more in revenue per month grew 7% year-over-year. This was driven by our improved ability to win multi-location deals as a result of our nationwide network.
We are generating higher ARPU by selling additional offerings such as cloud and managed services, co-location, equipment and network services to name a few. With small business customers, we are differentiating Windstream by creating innovative bundles that combine our voice and data offering with other managed services such as website design, hosting, and security. Our brand promise of smart solutions, personalized service is resonating across our business channel and business ARPU, excluding carrier revenues, grew 5%. Carrier circuits were up 3% due to fiber-to-the-tower installations, which were offset partially by a slowdown in carrier sales and increased disconnects related to carrier grooming activities and migrations to our fiber network.
On Slide 13, our consumer channel continued to deliver steady operational results. We added 6,000 new high-speed Internet customers, bringing our penetration of primary voice lines to 70%. Given this high penetration, growing broadband units has become more challenging. During the third quarter, we increased our promotional activity to improve our success in switching cable customers, which we expect to continue during the fourth quarter. Consumer voice lines declined by approximately 22,000 and represented a 4.4% decline in total customers year-over-year.
On Slide 14, our engineering team is making great progress on our capital initiative this year. Through the end of the third quarter, we have installed fiber to over 2,100 towers and have around 1,900 towers currently under construction that we expect to complete in the next 12 months. We expect to reach between 4,000 and 5,000 towers, both in and out of our ILEC footprint. 
In the consumer markets, we are launching VDSL in 87 markets here in the fourth quarter, which will enable roughly 45% of our customers to receive 10 to 12 meg speeds and 12% to receive 24 meg speeds, providing the opportunity to increase ARPU and improve our competitiveness.
Additionally, work is continuing on the broadband stimulus projects, which should add roughly 75,000 new addressable lines upon completion and provide an opportunity to further increase our broadband penetration. While our capital spend is elevated this year. Beginning next year, we expect CapEx intensity to decline as the fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects wind down. Excluding the initiative CapEx, our core CapEx intensity was below 13% during the third quarter.
To wrap up, the Windstream team is focused on executing our strategy and performing well. We are seeing steady progress in our integration efforts, business sales momentum and capital initiatives.
Thanks for your time this morning. We'll now take a few of your questions. Kevin, if you could please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

The difference in the third quarter was $83 million. Importantly, the items that make up that difference are temporary items and will disappear specifically related to the integration. And the breakdown of the $82 million relates to $13 million of merger integration, $12 million associated with our restructuring that we did in order to obtain $40 million in cost structure improvements and $18 million in integration CapEx. There was also some working capital used within the quarter of roughly $40 million, of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. So I look at those differences, importantly, we think those are temporary, specifically associated with our integration activities with PAETEC or more temporary in nature. And as you look to 2013 obviously, our integration will be more complete and we expect to incur substantially less charges going forward."

We're going to stay away from 2013 guidance, but just with respect to if you look at -- if you look to our business and specifically related to our investments, I think the reason that we began breaking out our core CapEx versus our initiative CapEx this quarter is to show even this quarter we're in that range of 11% to 13%. And that's really what we expect that Windstream can run on, on a long-term basis. And so we remain comfortable with that. We delivered on that in the quarter. Our fiber-to-the-tower and stimulus projects both will end in 2013, and so we feel good about that. As it relates to the AT&T announcement, we too have been making investments all year to improve our competitiveness relative to the cable players in our markets to increase our speed. So I think directionally, they've got that right. And we feel good about where we are performing today in that segment. You can see that we picked up some net gain versus the last quarter, albeit with some increased promotional activity as Brent referenced during his comments. But I think directionally, we're doing the right thing to really get the most bandwidth out of our network that we can today and be competitive as possible."

First of all, we had a plan with initiatives that we believed would allow us to reach $2.43 billion. I think that's what you're referring to on our last call. However, we've had some headwinds come up that will offset some of the expected benefits that give us some pause in terms of whether we can get all the way there. We're still doing everything we can to get there. Initiatives have been achieved. So we've done everything that we said we were going to do and they've resulted in nice improvements in the business, which we will continue in our run rate going forward, so they're permanent. During the quarter, specifically, we saw promotional pressures in the consumer channel and a slowdown in carrier revenues. As we look to 4Q, and much of that happened later in the third quarter, and so that's what affected our view of the range that I gave earlier. As we look to 4Q, we continue to expect considerable improvement in adjusted OIBDA sequentially. And as I said, our current view is that we'll come in between 2.41 and 2.43. Regardless of where we end or land in this range, it's about a 1% decline, which is a very solid outcome. And importantly, I think as investors are concerned about, the dividend is secure, whether we come in at $24.15 or $24.30, it really doesn't affect our view on the dividend with respect to 2013 and beyond. We're just -- we're seeing some temporary pressure and working very, very hard to overcome that. We can talk about some tailwinds that we have in the fourth quarter that lead to our confidence about our ability to improve our OIBDA sequentially. And those are, first of all, it'll be the first full quarter of the complete savings from our reorganization, so $10 million there. Very proud of what we're seeing in the business channel. As other -- some others in the industry have been reported some tough results on the business side, as Brent said, our strategy is continuing to resonate in the market and our business channels continuing to hit their sales quotas. We've got a considerable amount of fiber-to-the-tower installations going in, in the fourth quarter, which will help offset some of that carrier pressure that we talked about. We've got some additional PAETEC synergies. And finally, just as we look through the fourth quarter over the year, seasonally, we have lower costs. And the headwinds, as we said earlier, are carrier grooming on the TDM network and more aggressive consumer promotions. I'll let Brent give some more color on those specific headwinds that might help you better understand that."

One, is we turned up towers that we've been working hard to deliver. The speed of disconnects of the old copper access there was very fast, and that happened during the quarter. In addition, we saw in a couple states where we had lost that business. Those disconnects when those other competitive providers turned up fiber to our customers came in during the quarter much quicker than we thought might happen. The second thing we've seen and to Jeff's point, a little consistent with what we've seen from others in softness in sales. I mean, our carrier customers have seen sales to their retail base slow and that resulted in fewer carrier sales in the quarter as well, below the run rate we'd seen earlier in the year. But we step back and look at the carrier overall, it's still grown 5% year-to-date. And we've got momentum on delivery of our new fiber towers and continue to have conviction around wireless data usage and what that's going to mean for the future. In terms of the consumer side, we talked last time when we are slightly net negative on broadband adds in the second quarter, that we are stepping up our aggressiveness in the third quarter. And we really did that. I mean, that resulted in lower pricing and a little higher, for us, first month bill credit to offset some of the cost our customers experienced when they switched to Windstream. And that was reflected in our consumer business. But we felt we had to do that. And as you see in our broadband net, we showed a 10,000-unit net improvement from Q2 versus Q3, so that message resonated in the marketplace and it's just frankly a more competitive space and if we're going to retain our share and grow, we needed to respond. And I've been happy with how our team did just that."

What is sort of the long-term churn for that, if you signed up a customer on a promotion, 6-month promotion or whatever it is, what's sort of the stickiness, what percentage of those customers stay after the promotion is off?

And so we're constantly working from everything with -- from our interconnection costs to our efficiencies in terms of things like service delivery. We've got a lot of technology improvement happening in 2013 that will help us with that. But fundamentally, we're confident that we can continue to grow our business services with the targeted capital intensity of 11% to 13%, work on somebody's cost initiatives to get the kind of operating leverage that you're talking about. We've got a fairly unique model, which I think that everybody's struggling like -- with a little bit. We don't look exactly like Time Warner Telecom and we don't look like an RLEC. Our CLEC strategy uses an efficient capital deployment process where we use a combination of network options, including leveraging the significant amount of fiber that we have today, making new success-based capital investments and in some cases, leasing last-mile facilities. So I think that's fairly unique. But when you take everything as a whole, we feel confident in our ability to continue to improve the operating margins in the CLEC business. That's what we're betting on in the long term. We see a path there. We've been making improvements sequentially and expect that to continue into '13 and beyond."

And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, that was driven by higher-than-anticipated usage trends and some carrier settlements. There is usage seasonality and typically, third quarter is a good usage quarter for Windstream. It was simply a little better than we anticipated. And we'd also had some carrier settlements that were modestly positive to us but that's part of the put and take of just being a telecom company. And finally, we do expect Switched Access decline to drop in 4Q as they do through normal seasonality. But importantly, the wholesale business is now a shrinking part of Windstream. As Jeff indicated, business services and consumer broadband are now nearly 70% of our business, meaning that wholesale and consumer voice represent under 30% of our business."

When -- how long do you think that will take and when do you expect that to transition off onto the Ethernet network?

On the carrier grooming, I mean really, the length of time it's going to take is kind of tied to our delivery of towers, which we really expect to continue into 2013, and so I think that's a trend we'll continue to see. So how that impacts us is yet to be determined. But I mean, we always knew that those old copper circuits providing that access would be disconnected. The question was really the speed at which that would be disconnected. And as we've seen, once we turn up the networks, we're doing all the testing, they're built to be redundant, they're working as planned, and those copper discos are following very quickly thereafter. So over 2013 is my expectation there. In terms of the network expenses, I mean PAETEC was doing some work to connect those networks. You are right, they weren't fully integrated. They were working to continue that effort, along with connectivity to our own network. That's not something that happens in a short period of time and that's something that's underway as we speak today, and will continue for at least the next 2 to 3 years. That's a long-term effort just given the sensitivity, of course, to outages and the customer ramifications on that kind of activity. But that's something that is in our expense run rate. I wouldn't say you should expect increased levels of cost associated with that effort."

As we saw our first fiber-to-the-tower conversions, there was a much longer time frame in terms of the carriers, the wireless carriers converting off the TDM network entirely and going to the fiber. And it seems as we progressed through the year and they've gotten more comfortable with their fiber-to-the-tower conversions, they've just done that much quicker. And that, too, quite frankly, has been a surprise, that they've been able to do that faster later in the year, and that's contributing a little bit to the carrier pressure."

And I've been -- I'm really, really pleased with how those teams -- we've kind of got a matrix sales team, one focused totally on data center quota and then, of course, the other focused on network, and just how well they partnered together to pursue leads and opportunities in the marketplace, and that's what's driving those results. So making that a bigger part of every discussion we have with customers where we can sell that product line. So pleased with that momentum. In terms of the hurricane, you're right, we do have some operations in East Coast and we have had some impact from the hurricane. Our employees have certainly been working hard to restore service to our customers. Fortunately, we didn't experience just a great deal of plant damage, but we have been dealing with some power and service outages, primarily related, as you mentioned, to some last-mile access we had through Verizon. But the vast majority of our customers are already back in service and we're not expecting the financial impact from that to be material in the quarter, Donna."
