On an overall basis, we ended 2011 above our previous forecast at $3.02 of earnings per share, of which $2.87 of the EPS represents our core 2011 results as presented in our press release, excluding the private fee-for-service runout.
And we're also pleased to forecast 2012 EPS of $3.10 to $3.30 which is an 8% to 15% growth rate compared to 2011's core EPS of $2.87.

Early 2012 financial expectations were a bit cautious it's because it was year marked by a transition to the first major impact of health care reform with a very considerable task of implementing minimum MLRs in our commercial business.
I'd like to begin a more detailed discussion about our future discussing our Medicaid business and the various significant products that we're making in seizing opportunities and growing this business.
We were awarded the Kentucky contract in July of 2011, with the contract commencing in November of the same year. Based on our positioning and network efforts throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we we're able to achieve an outsized membership allocation compared to the other participants. In fact, we've grown again this past month and we're now up to approximately 232,000 members.
One of the key elements to this recent growth was our ability to rapidly execute on building out a cost-competitive network. We're able to bring our collective resources to bear, including leveraging our centralized operational functions and we imported one of our experienced executives to Kentucky from our existing business. The point of all this is that we're a resourceful company with over 14,000 employees with experience in all lines of business and the ability to execute simultaneous opportunities. It's really early in the Kentucky contract and we're still refining operational processes and programs as this was a previously unmanaged population entering managed care. Even though it's really, we're very optimistic and confident that we'll have a successful partnership with the Commonwealth of Kentucky for years to come.
I want to continue on the Medicaid topic, and we have some additional news to report, which is another recent win that we would like to highlight this morning. Our company has been notified by the state of Nebraska of its intent to award a contract to Coventry to provide services for the state's expansion of the existing Medicaid managed care program. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services intends to expand managed Medicare services from the existing 10-county program to cover all 93 counties in the state, which is an estimated incremental 70,000 additional Nebraskans.
As you may recall, we won a bid in 2010 for the original program and currently serve approximately 50,000 members in the existing Medicaid program. So subject to the finalization of the contract with the state of Nebraska, we expect to be 1 of 2 managed-care contractors providing services to this expanded population later this year.
Staying with Medicaid, also during 2011, we were able to seize an attractive 2-state Medicaid acquisition opportunity while by acquiring Family Health Partners and entering into a long-term relationship with its previous owner, Children's Mercy of Kansas City. This acquisition, which closed effective January 1 of 2012, has Medicaid contracts in both Kansas and Missouri. We were able to expand in Missouri, a state we have served for over 15 years, and entered the Kansas Medicaid program, where there's an expansion opportunity for 2013 and beyond.
Including this acquisition, we have a meaningful multiline presence throughout our Midwest 7-State region which now serves 1.5 million members. We were able to execute on this multifaceted transaction for a reasonable net investment of approximately $50 million, net of tax benefit and statutory capital, we were able to leave behind based on the structure of this transaction.
To summarize the Medicaid discussion and quantify the growth for you, we started 2011 with 470,000 Medicaid members and reported $1.38 billion of Medicaid revenue in 2011 which represented approximately 11% of our total revenue. We expect to double these figures with more than 915,000 members beginning in 2012 with a full-year revenue forecast of around $2.7 billion.
Medicaid is projected to represent just under 20% of the company's revenue in 2012. Investors should think of Coventry as having a meaningful exposure to Medicare growth and penetration opportunities with a proven track record of winning new business, executing and operating these Medicaid businesses but without the concentrated risk and the inherent volatility and contract alliance of a single line carrier. While the process of winning new business is competitive, we very strongly believe that we'll get our share in the future. We know both how to compete and how to manage this business.
Moving away from Medicaid and talking about Medicare, we're equally enthusiastic about the recent results in Medicare. As you may have seen in our press lease a few weeks ago, we had a very successful 2012 annual election period. As most of you know, a lot of this worked to achieve success has done well in advance. And as we have previously promised, we focused on laying the foundation during 2011 to grow both Medicare Advantage and Part D in 2012.
In Medicare Advantage, we are in 15 states and we have seen 2012 growth across 14 of those 15 states. The most recent enrollment for Medicare Advantage is approximately 250,000 members which is ahead of our previous estimate and results in membership growth of about 13% so far in 2012. We've grown from 137,000 Medicare court Medicare members at the end of 2008 to 250,000 today for a compounded annual growth rate of 16%. We're well-proportioned -- or well-positioned where positioned to continue to taking advantage of this attractive demographic growth opportunity where we're able to provide a tangible value proposition to seniors and to the Federal Government.
On Part D, we had a successful enrollment period, growing membership of about 25% out of the gate and adding almost 300,000 members.
2011, as you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the work we were doing on product design and developing, creating partnerships and we had successfully launched the third product with a preferred network in 2012's annual election period. We increased both our auto-assign footprint and our mainstream membership coming into 2012. Our company has consistently been profitable in Part D and both membership channels since we launched in 2006 and 2011 was no exception, with an aggregate Part D loss ratio of 81.7% for the year.
During 2011, a lot of effort went into forming attractive set of products and establishing partnerships with Walgreens, Walmart and Target for our newest product. We also renegotiated our PBM contract with an improved Part D cost structure and enhanced other areas of Part D, including distribution. I think Part D is a great example of our abilities to successfully execute on multiple growth opportunities given our focus on resources, touching multiple product lines. Our cross-functional teams are back to the drawing board after 2010 and created a product that is low-cost structure and which has proven to be attractive to the senior population.
And if you might well imagine, we're currently hard at work on our products and positioning for 2013 and very optimistic about our prospects in the future.
Think about our company with Medicare at about 30% of the company revenues and Medicaid at about 20%. So we've evolved about half of our revenue coming from government programs. There continues to be attractive opportunity to grow in the current programs while there is a significant longer-term opportunity to serve the due eligible population. Medicaid and Medicare experience, footprint and capabilities are all important ingredients in positioning to serve due eligibles. We are currently in 10 states for Medicaid and 15 states for Medicare Advantage. 8 of our 10 Medicaid states have filed letters of intent with CMS, they integrated to do eligible population and their states. And for decades, we have provided complex care management and then served members across population, products and geographies with a cross-section of product condition, diseases and needs. We currently serve aged line to disabled members and other high-risk patients in Medicaid. We currently serve Medicaid members up-and-down the risk score spectrum including due eligibles.
Serving members with the most product have debilitating disease should not be taken lightly but this population is one that can significantly benefit by coordination of care or active chronic condition management, pharmacy management, social services and all other programs that we have built our past decade to manage our current diverse population.
Managed care should be able to make a meaningful, positive impact on the lives of due eligible population, and therefore, provide a valuable -- a value proposition for the states and Federal Government. Based on our footprint, exposure to both Medicaid and Medicare capabilities and a history of managing diverse populations, we like our early and positioning for this longer-term significant opportunity and our company will continue to invest in Medicare and Medicaid growth, along with eligible populations.
Moving to our commercial business. Our Commercial Risk revenue was up 8% for 2011 with stable membership versus 2010 which is reasonably satisfying given the first year impact of health care reform including minimum MLRs which were effective January 1st of last year.
We knew it wasn't going to be easy managing 121 different measurement sales in our Commercial business and dealing with the burdens imposed by the new laws and regulations, many of which fell very short on clarity coming into the beginning of 2011. As Randy Giles will cover, as expected, we entered the year with significant minimum Medical Loss Ratio rebate accrual which will get finalized and paid out in 2012. Our goal for 2012 and beyond in the Commercial business is to maintain margin and see the growth opportunities that we expect to develop as a result of consolidating market conditions driven by a commitment in this sophistication required to operate health care in the health care reform environment.
And in this context, we're actively preparing for the potential 2014 expansion  . We'll continue to look for attractive commercial expansion opportunities, both through acquisitions and organic growth and increase our footprint with providers and high-performance networks which will drive lower-cost products to complement our product portfolio.
As of today, we have signed approximately 30 high-performance network contracts across our product lines. These arrangements run the spectrum from large-scale health systems to local-based primary multispecialty provider groups. 17 of these 30 high-performance networks covers our commercial product in 14 states, and we feel should position us very well especially in an exchange environment.
As you can tell, we're very positive about our opportunities across the diverse footprint in Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial lines of business. We feel that the commercial business could represent a meaningful growth opportunity in 2014 and 2015 and allow us to be diversified in addition to key substantial Medicaid and Medicare growth opportunities.
In addition, we have over $1.1 billion in higher-margin and diversified fee-based revenue that complement our risk business and provide free cash flow for deployment to increase shareholder value.
Continuing on my comments regarding our future plans, we're going to pursue organic growth in our existing businesses. We're going to pursue selected RFPs. We're going to deploy capital for acquisitions, and in addition, consider future share repurchase. I think we're not only positioned well from a business and growth perspective heading into 2012, but we also accomplished a good deal relative to our balance sheet in the past year and Randy will address that later. We sit here with $900 million in deployable cash and that's after posting on a meaningful transaction flying back over 10 million shares in 2011 and paying off our 2012 note that recently came due.
We're exiting 2011 on track after increasing EPS guidance 3x during the year, and were able to provide 2012 guidance which results in 18% to 15% core EPS growth in 2012 and coupled with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to have a strong and flexible balance sheet with a combination of free cash and additional debt capacity.
I like our positioning and balanced exposure across Medicaid, Medicare and the commercial line, as well as our capability in seeking and seizing the right M&A opportunities. We're getting results from the work we have done and we'll continue on this path to deliver more growth.
So what does it take to deliver growth? Well, it takes capital. It takes capable, experienced executive team. It takes experience in the M&A area. It takes focus. It takes discipline. It takes the ability to move quickly. These are all capabilities our company has. I am more optimistic about our future than I have been any time in the recent past.
And Randy Giles is going to walk you through the results and provide detailed guidance with additional commentary on our business. And with that, Randy?"

I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start",2849,"Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start at the consolidated level. Our GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.60 which includes $0.02 related to the runout of the Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service business. For the full year, we reported EPS of $3.02, excluding the litigation gain in the second quarter, compared to our previous EPS guidance of $2.95 to $3. This includes $0.15 of earnings related to private fee-for-service and $2.87 of core EPS for 2011.
Similar to last quarter, we have provided a table and reconciliation of these earnings metrics on Page 3 of our earnings press release. I'm very pleased with these results for 2011 as we were able to outperform our earnings guidance in each quarter during the year, grew our Health Plan membership by more than 7% from the prior year, position ourselves for continued growth in 2012, deliver the largest Medicaid RFP win in the company's history and utilized the strength of our balance sheet to seize an exciting growth opportunity while repurchasing more than 7% of our outstanding share count.
These successes have positioned our portfolio of businesses very well for 2012 which I will highlight in detail after first giving you a little more color on the 2011 performance.
In our commercial business, first, one housekeeping item. You'll notice that we have now aligned our reporting of revenue PMPM and MLR percentage metrics to be consistent with the rest of the industry by disclosing Commercial Risk as opposed our historical disclosure of Commercial Group Risk statistics which excluded the commercial individual business. In addition to creating a better comparison our peer group, we also wanted to grow impact that individual businesses having on our commercial results, as we continue to increase our market share and invest in building out our capabilities in advance of the potential membership opportunity in the exchanges.
In 2008, for instance, we had 123,000 individual numbers. Whereas today, we have slightly more than 200,000 members. Also, the individual MLR has become much more comparable to the small group MLR due to health care reform regulations. This new disclosure structure is reflected in the earnings release issued this morning for both the current period as well as all historical periods disclosed.
Our commercial MLR was 83.7% in the fourth quarter and 81.6% for the full year which is slightly above our previously provided guidance. As we continue to gain parity on the minimum MLR regulations during the back half of 2011, we had to refine our rebate calculations to reflect the allowable underlying cost of certain internal and external medical related vendors. We began the year expecting to be able to reflect medical related payments to internal and external vendors in their entirety as such in the minimum MLR calculations. But based upon clarity we gained in MLR rules Q3 and subsequent data-gathering from our vendors Q4, including our external PBM, we made adjustments that increased the Medical Loss Ratio. I'll highlight this for you as it had about a 50 basis point impact on our full-year 2011 commercial MLR relative to our initial guidance.
Within our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points, with unit cost trend continuing to be the largest driver, albeit stable. In the rearview mirror, we can see trends the mid-7s that continue to move higher off of the extreme low levels seen during the second half of 2010. These trends include the impact of the health care reform regulations implemented on September 23, 2010, which just had between 150 and 200 basis points from the impact of the trend this year that will not recur in 2012.
Inpatient utilization lows late 2010 continues to show a negative as it has throughout 2011. Similar to what we disclosed to you last quarter, we're seeing outpatient physician trends creep up and move from negative in the slightly positive territory. Just to put it in context, remember today's trends are being compared to the lowest level of utilization trends seen in years, a historically low base line from late 2010.
And probably most importantly, our pricing structure is predicated on a forward view of trend in which we have anticipated return in more levels -- normally levels of utilization above what we've seen in the rearview mirror. This pricing expected to generate higher absolute rate increases than we're seeing throughout 2011 as we've established a new baseline with many of the adjustments related to health care reform already addressed and the benefit of the extremely low utilization 2010 has already been passed through to our experience-rated customers.
Finally, the commercial results. I want to share our customary statistics around health care reform which are consistent with the projections from the last call. For 2011, we generate total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion. Of that total, individual business generate approximately $375 million of revenue with the vast majority of this business in a rebate position. The remaining $5.6 billion of group risk revenues were split roughly 40% small group and 60% large group with approximately half of our small group business in a rebate position and a little less than 0.25 of our large group business in a rebate position.
It's important to note that rebate exposure is something that we've been managing carefully with a number of actions taken to utilize rebate capital during the year, including providing more value to our customers, also promoting quality nations providers to improve stores, strengthen the overall quality of care and to create opportunities to lower future medical costs. This has driven our rebate estimates down significantly from our initial view in 2011. In 2012, we expected it to get from certain vendor contracts which will serve to decrease our overall cost structure and reduce our rebate accrual in 2012. We view our estimated rebate for 2011 as reasonable given the size of our book of business, this being the first year navigating these new regulations and the inherent loss ratio variablity that exists when calculated the market side segment in the state level.
While we're not assuming a benefit from multiple states with minimal MLR pending with HSS, we were disappointed to see waiver request denied in some of our larger states, including Florida and Kansas. This result creates more challenging operating individual business in these markets will force us to continue to evaluate our participation in that product on a market-by-market basis. Of the states with currently pending with HHS, North Carolina is the only state where Coventry has an individual price presence.
Moving on to government programs, our Medicare results for the fourth quarter were a continuation of strong results that we saw throughout 2011 and an even better result in 2010. Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 82.3% for the quarter and 82.9% for the full year was a very strong result and one that gives us confidence in our bid positioning, as we look to towards 2012. Our Medicare Part D results were also strong as the fourth quarter MLR of 60.5%, full-year MLR of 81.7% were both better than our expectations and an improvement from the prior year.
As Alen already highlighted, we are excited about that growth trajectory that we built for the Medicare business with revenue growth of more than 20% and membership growth of nearly 50% in 2011. Our Medicaid results in the quarter were consistent with our expectation as we saw an uptick in our reported revenue PMPM as well as MLR percentage, wit the inclusion of the new content Kentucky contract which was effective on November 1.
Finally, we closed out 2011 with another excellent SG&A result, reporting a full-year expense of $2.015 billion as compared to our initial guidance of $2.02 billion. This accomplishment is particularly impressive when you consider that while we were holding absolute SG&A spend just below our initial guidance for the year, we were simultaneously able to grow revenue above the initial guidance midpoint by more than $425 million.
Full-year expense, including the elevated level of spend during the fourth quarter related to the successful Medicare enrollment period and the launch of the new Kentucky Medicaid contract, which together, about more than 0.5 million new members to the company.
Before we get into 2012 guidance, let me first review some metrics on our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remains in a high-quality position with a net unrealized gain of $97 million at year-end, an increase from $90 million in the prior quarter. As of January 31, we had $900 million of deployable free cash available which is after retiring $234 million of senior notes earlier in January, as well as the deployment of $100 million during the fourth quarter for share repurchase. Recall that one of our accomplishments in 2011 was repositioning our balance sheet 10-year $600 million senior notes in June 2011 and renewing our credit facility. We have no scheduled the debt maturities now until 2014 having undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016. This gives us a great deal of flexibility as we pursue capital deployment opportunities. And as you have seen throughout 2011, while acquisitions remain our first priority for capital deployment, we're also committed to returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases, as seen through our deployment of $328 million in 2011.
Moving on to our cash flow results, you recall that we received an extra payment from CMS in the third quarter, so you can see the impact from that under the deferred revenue line in fourth quarter results and impact preferred revenue for the full year. The full-year result was impacted by the second quarter litigation settlement. So after adjusting earnings for the litigation items, our cash flow from operations was $496 million or 112% of net income for the year. As you can see on the other receivables line of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by the timing of certain Medicare Part D receivables related to the 2011 program here that we will collect from CMS in 2012.
So with a successful 2011 behind us, let's now discuss our outlook for 2012.
Today, we are providing initial 2012 EPS guidance in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 which is an increase of 8% at the low end and 15% at the high end versus the comparable 2011 EPS of $2.87. In that area, we are projecting revenues of nearly $14 billion, a growth of approximately $1.75 billion which is up roughly 15% of the midpoint. We are forecasting an increase in consolidated MLR percentage which is driven by changes in the mix across our portfolio businesses toward growth in government programs.
In 2011, commercial revenue represented approximately 50% of the company total with an additional 30% Medicare, 10% Medicaid and 10% other including fee businesses. Our guidance for 2012 projects around new composition of just over 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% fee and other. This is consistent with our goal to have a balanced portfolio with the ability to seize opportunities across the product spectrum.
On the topic of medical cost structure, we have recently negotiated extended our PBM contract with Medco for a multiyear period effective January 1, 2012. We're able to secure an improved cost structure and contract terms that give us more flexibility, as we continue to react to the rapidly evolving health care marketplace. Given that pharmacy spend represents nearly 20% of our medical expenditures, this is an important improvement to a critical part of our overall cost structure across our product portfolio.
Moving onto SG&A, I'm particularly pleased with efforts that the organization has put forth on driving down our SG&A percentage of revenue from 16.5% in 2011 to a midpoint of 15.4% on our 2012 guidance 2012. I'm personally involved in working to identify cost reduction opportunities for the company that have allowed us forecast the strong result for 2012 while simultaneously also making critical investments for the feature in our core businesses. These investments include improved direct distribution capabilities from individual business, enhanced care management tools, the addition of substantial Medicare Medicaid resources, not to mention the ongoing increased compliance costs. And that's just to name a few.
Other nonoperating items, you'll note that the tax rate is increased over 2011 which is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of earnings towards states with higher tax rates and also about compliance with new health care reform regulations.
Finally, you will see our share count guidance which assumes that we essentially hold the share count flat from where we ended 2011. It's important to note that today's EPS guidance range does not as not incorporate any meaningful deployment of the free cash that is sitting on our balance sheet.
Now moving more specifically into our largest lines of business. For Commercial Risk, we are forecasting membership levels to be slightly down for 2011 levels with a decrease in Q1 2012 driven by a handful of large group terminations followed by growth during the remainder of the year. We continue to price ahead of trend and remain disciplined in our objective of maintaining margin while pursuing membership gains. On the expense side, we are projecting MLR of 81.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This MLR guidance incorporates mechanics minimum MLR rules, our view of pricing by market, a forward view on medical trends, our mix of business and fragmented view that you always have deviations from the mean as you manage your portfolio of 121 measurements cells. This is a slight improvement from 2011 as that 11 that we view as sustainable under health care reform in today's operating environment.
In Medicare, the membership story is excellent for both Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. As Allen noted earlier, we're starting the year with approximately 250,000 Medicare Advantage members which is an impressive growth result of about 13% from 2011. Our Medicare Part D business was also very successful during the annual election period as we grew by almost 300,000 members or about 25%, and we are forecasting continued growth throughout 2012. This growth is a nice mix of retail purchase in our innovative new value plus product and partnership with Walgreens, Walmart and Target, as well as our increased auto assignment presence in 23 regions for 2012, up from 15 regions in 2011. Based upon our bids and our view of where we exited 2011, we are forecasting MLRs in the low- to mid-80s for both Medicare Advantage and Part D.
Staying within government programs, our 10-state Medicaid business is the biggest part of or 2012 growth story with total revenue expected to nearly double with just under $1.4 billion in 2011 to nearly $2.7 million in 2012. Today, we are just about 915,000 members and expect to be in the zone of 950,000 Medicaid numbers upon implementation of the new Nebraska contract. We are projecting MLR of approximately 90% in 2012 which is a combination of our same-store business, which runs in the mid- to high-80s, and MLRs in the 90s for RFP wins in the newly acquired Family Health Partners business in the Midwest.
So now we've covered the large risk business, you'll notice that although we are still forecasting over $1.1 billion of fee-based revenue, our guidance for fee revenue is down a little, more than 3% due to the loss of 1 Workers' Compensation Services account. However, you also see a decrease in cost of sales expense item directly associated with Workers' Compensation Services which more than offset the aggregate fee revenue reduction. Our fee businesses continue to be an important part of our overall product portfolio, providing valuable unregulated cash flows and are an area that we intend to grow and adjust .
So in conclusion, our efforts in 2011 lay the foundation for the 2012 guidance that we provided today. We firmly believe that growing the top line is critical in today's environment and are pleased to see 2011's efforts bearing fruit in 2012 with the revenue guidance midpoint of nearly $14 billion, up with an increase in both operating earnings and EPS. So while we may be pleased with the 2012 growth outlook, by no means are we satisfied. We will continue to invest in the future, focus on managing our portfolio businesses in a manner that allows us to seize growth opportunities while also maintaining the right balance lending our exposure to any one area. We will continue to reduce growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisition to strategically position Coventry to deliver the long-term results that our shareholders have come to expect.

I want to spend most my time this morning talking about the 2012 and the future, which much of the groundwork is based on work that we completed in 2010 and 2011. Randy Giles, our CFO, will review the quarter and provide more detailed guidance."

If early 2012 financial expectations were a bit cautious, it's because it was a year marked by a transition to the first major impact of health care reform with a very considerable task of implementing minimum MLRs in our commercial business.
I'd like to begin a more detailed discussion about our future, discussing our Medicaid business and the various significant progress that we are making in seizing opportunities and growing this business.
We were awarded the Kentucky contract in July of 2011, with the contract commencing in November of the same year. Based on our positioning and network efforts throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we're able to achieve an outsized membership allocation compared to the other participants. In fact, we've grown again this past month, and we're now up to approximately 232,000 members.
One of the key elements to this recent growth was our ability to rapidly execute on building out a cost-competitive network. We're able to bring our collective resources to bear, including leveraging our centralized operational functions, and we imported one of our experienced executives to Kentucky from our existing business. The point of all this is that we're a resourceful company with over 14,000 employees with experience in all lines of business and the ability to execute simultaneous opportunities. It's really early in the Kentucky contract, and we're still refining operational processes and programs as this was a previously unmanaged population entering managed care. Even though it's really, we're very optimistic and confident that we'll have a successful partnership with the Commonwealth of Kentucky for years to come.
I want to continue on the Medicaid topic, and we have some additional news to report, which is another recent win that we would like to highlight this morning. Our company has been notified by the state of Nebraska of its intent to award a contract to Coventry to provide services for the state's expansion of the existing Medicaid managed care program. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services intends to expand managed Medicare services from the existing 10-county program to cover all 93 counties in the state, which is an estimated incremental 70,000 additional Nebraskans.
As you may recall, we won a bid in 2010 for the original program and currently serve approximately 50,000 members in the existing Medicaid program. So subject to the finalization of the contract with the state of Nebraska, we expect to be 1 of 2 managed care contractors providing services to this expanded population later this year.
Staying with Medicaid, also during 2011, we were able to seize an attractive 2-state Medicaid acquisition opportunity by acquiring Family Health Partners and entering into a long-term relationship with its previous owner, Children's Mercy of Kansas City. This acquisition, which closed effective January 1 of 2012, has Medicaid contracts in both Kansas and Missouri. We were able to expand in Missouri, a state we have served for over 15 years, and entered the Kansas Medicaid program, where there's an expansion opportunity for 2013 and beyond.
Including this acquisition, we have a meaningful multiline presence throughout our Midwest 7-state region, which now serves 1.5 million members. We were able to execute on this multifaceted transaction for a reasonable net investment of approximately $50 million, net of tax benefit and statutory capital we were able to leave behind based on the structure of this transaction.
To summarize the Medicaid discussion and quantify the growth for the year, we started 2011 with 470,000 Medicaid members and reported $1.38 billion of Medicaid revenue in 2011, which represented approximately 11% of our total revenue. We expect to double these figures with more than 915,000 members beginning in 2012 with a full year revenue forecast of around $2.7 billion.
Medicaid is projected to represent just under 20% of the company's revenue in 2012. I think that investors should think of Coventry as having a meaningful exposure to Medicare growth and penetration opportunities with a proven track record of winning new business, executing and operating these Medicaid businesses but without the concentrated risk and the inherent volatility and contract alliance of a single-line carrier. While the process of winning new business is competitive, we very strongly believe that we'll get our share in the future. We know both how to compete and how to manage this business.
Moving away from Medicaid and talking about Medicare. We're equally enthusiastic about the recent results in Medicare. As you may have seen in our press release a few weeks ago, we had a very successful 2012 annual election period. As most of you know, a lot of this work to achieve success was done well in advance. And as we have previously promised, we focused on laying the foundation during 2011 to grow both Medicare Advantage and Part D in 2012.
In Medicare Advantage, we're in 15 states, and we have seen 2012 growth across 14 of those 15 states. The most recent enrollment for Medicare Advantage is approximately 250,000 members, which is ahead of our previous estimate, and results in membership growth of about 13% so far in 2012. We've grown from 137,000 Medicare Coordinated Care members at the end of 2008 to 250,000 today for a compounded annual growth rate of 16%. We're well proportioned -- or positioned to continue taking the advantage of this attractive demographic growth opportunity where we're able to provide a tangible value proposition to seniors and to the federal government.
On Part D, we had a successful enrollment period, growing membership of about 25% out of the gate and adding almost 300,000 members.
2011, as you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the work we were doing on product design and developing, creating partnerships, and we had successfully launched the third product with a preferred network in 2012's annual election period. We increased both our auto-assign footprint and our mainstream membership coming into 2012. Our company has consistently been profitable in Part D in both membership channels since we launched in 2006, and 2011 was no exception, with an aggregate Part D loss ratio of 81.7% for the year.
During 2011, a lot of effort went into forming an attractive set of products and establishing partnerships with Walgreens, Walmart and Target for our newest product. We also renegotiated our PBM contract with an improved Part D cost structure and enhanced other areas of Part D, including distribution. I think Part D is a great example of our abilities to successfully execute on multiple growth opportunities given our focus on resources, touching multiple product lines. Our cross-functional teams were back to the drawing board after 2010 and created a product that is low-cost structure and which is proven to be attractive to the senior population.
And as you might well imagine, we're currently hard at work on our products and positioning for 2013 and very optimistic about our prospects in the future.
Think about our company with Medicare at about 30% of the company revenues and Medicaid at about 20%. So we've evolved about half of our revenue coming from government programs. There continues to be attractive opportunity to grow in the current programs, while there is a significant longer-term opportunity to serve the dual-eligible population. Medicaid and Medicare experience, footprint and capabilities are all important ingredients in positioning to serve dual eligibles. We are currently in 10 states for Medicaid and 15 states for Medicare Advantage. 8 of our 10 Medicaid states have filed letters of intent with CMS to integrate the dual-eligible population in their states. 
And for decades, we have provided complex care management and then served members across population, products and geographies with a cross-section of chronic condition, diseases and needs. We currently serve aged line to disabled members and other high-risk patients in Medicaid. We currently serve Medicaid members up and down the risk score spectrum, including dual eligibles.
Serving members with the most chronic and debilitating disease should not be taken lightly, but this population is one that can significantly benefit by coordination of care or active chronic condition management, pharmacy management, social services and all other programs that we have built over the past decade to manage our current diverse population.
Managed care should be able to make a meaningful, positive impact on the lives of dual-eligible population, and therefore, provide a valuable -- a value proposition for the states and federal government. Based on our footprint, exposure to both Medicaid and Medicare capabilities and a history of managing diverse populations, we like our early positioning for this longer-term significant opportunity, and our company will continue to invest in Medicare and Medicaid growth, along with dual-eligible populations.
Moving to our commercial business. Our Commercial Risk revenue was up 8% for 2011 with stable membership versus 2010, which is reasonably satisfying given the first year impact of health care reform, including minimum MLRs, which were effective January 1 of last year.
We knew it wasn't going to be easy managing 121 different measurement sales in our Commercial business and dealing with the burdens imposed by the new laws and regulations, many of which fell very short on clarity coming into the beginning of 2011. As Randy Giles will cover, as expected, we ended the year with significant minimum medical loss ratio rebate accrual, which will get finalized and paid out in 2012. Our goal for 2012 and beyond in the commercial business is to maintain margin and see the growth opportunities that we expect to develop as a result of consolidating market conditions driven by a commitment in this sophistication required to operate health care in the health care reform environment.
And in this context, we're actively preparing for the potential 2014 expansion [ph]. We'll continue to work on attractive commercial expansion opportunities, both through acquisitions and organic growth and increase our footprint with providers and high-performance networks, which will drive lower-cost products to complement our product portfolio.
As of today, we have signed approximately 30 high-performance network contracts across our product lines. These arrangements run the spectrum from large-scale health systems to local-based primary multispecialty provider groups. 17 of these 30 high-performance networks covers our commercial product in 14 states and we feel should position us very well, especially in an exchange environment.
As you can tell, we're very positive about our opportunities across our diverse footprint in Medicare, Medicaid and commercial lines of business. We feel that the commercial business could represent a meaningful growth opportunity in 2014 and 2015 and allow us to be diversified in addition to key substantial Medicaid and Medicare growth opportunities.
In addition, we have over $1.1 billion in higher-margin and diversified fee-based revenue that complement our risk business and provide free cash flow for deployment to increase shareholder value.
Continuing on my comments regarding our future plans, we're going to pursue organic growth in our existing businesses. We're going to pursue selected RFPs. We're going to deploy capital for acquisitions, and in addition, consider future share repurchase. I think we're not only positioned well from a business and growth perspective heading into 2012, but we also accomplished a good deal relative to our balance sheet in the past year, and Randy will address that later. We sit here with $900 million in deployable cash, and that's after posting on a meaningful transaction, buying back over 10 million shares in 2011 and paying off our 2012 note that recently came due.
We're exiting 2011 on track after increasing EPS guidance 3x during the year, and we're able to provide 2012 guidance, which results in 18% to 15% core EPS growth in 2012, coupled with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to have a strong and flexible balance sheet with a combination of free cash and additional debt capacity.
I like our positioning and balanced exposure across Medicaid, Medicare and the commercial line, as well as our capability in seeking and seizing the right M&A opportunities. We're getting results from the work we have done, and we'll continue on this path to deliver more growth.
So what does it take to deliver growth? Well, it takes capital. It takes capable, experienced executive team. It takes experience in the M&A area. It takes focus. It takes discipline. It takes the ability to move quickly. These are all capabilities our company has. I am more optimistic about our future than I have been any time in the recent past.
Randy Giles is going to walk you through the results and provide detailed guidance with additional commentary on our business. And with that, Randy?"
27133,157003674,217413,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start",2900,"Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start at the consolidated level. Our GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.60, which includes $0.02 related to the runout of the Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service business. For the full year, we reported EPS of $3.02, excluding the litigation gain in the second quarter, compared to our previous EPS guidance of $2.95 to $3. This includes $0.15 of earnings related to Private Fee-for-Service and $2.87 of core EPS for 2011.
Similar to last quarter, we have provided a table and reconciliation of these earnings metrics on Page 3 of our earnings press release. I'm very pleased with these results for 2011 as we were able to outperform our earnings guidance each quarter during the year, grew our Health Plan membership by more than 7% from the prior year, position ourselves for continued growth in 2012, deliver the largest Medicaid RFP win in the company's history and utilize the strength of our balance sheet to seize an exciting growth opportunity while repurchasing more than 7% of our outstanding share count.
These successes have positioned our portfolio of businesses very well for 2012, which I will highlight in detail after first giving you a little more color on the 2011 performance.
In our commercial business, first, one housekeeping item. You'll notice that we have now aligned our reporting of revenue PMPM and MLR percentage metrics to be consistent with the rest of the industry by disclosing Commercial Risk as opposed to our historical disclosure of Commercial Group Risk statistics, which excluded the commercial individual business. In addition to creating a better comparison to our peer group, we also wanted to recognize the growing impact that the individual business is having on our commercial results as we continue to increase our market share and invest in building out our capabilities in advance of the potential membership opportunity in the exchanges.
In 2008, for instance, we had 123,000 individual members. Whereas today, we have slightly more than 200,000 members. Also, the individual MLR has become much more comparable to the small group MLR due to health care reform regulations. This new disclosure structure is reflected in the earnings release issued this morning for both the current period as well as all historical periods disclosed.
Our commercial MLR was 83.7% in the fourth quarter and 81.6% for the full year, which is slightly above our previously provided guidance. As we continue to gain clarity on the minimum MLR regulations during the back half of 2011, we had to refine our rebate calculations to reflect the allowable underlying cost of certain internal and external medical-related vendors. We began the year expecting to be able to reflect medical-related payments to internal and external vendors in their entirety as such in the minimum MLR calculations. But based upon clarity we gained in MLR rules Q3 and subsequent data gathering from our vendors in Q4, including our external PBM, we made adjustments that increased the medical loss ratio. I highlight this for you as it had about a 50 basis point impact on our full year 2011 commercial MLR relative to our initial guidance.
Within our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points with unit cost trend continuing to be the largest driver, albeit stable. In the rearview mirror, we can see trends the mid-7s that continue to move higher off of the extreme low levels seen during the second half of 2010. These trends include the impact of the health care reform regulations implemented on September 23, 2010, which just had between 150 and 200 basis points of impact on the trend this year that will not recur in 2012.
Inpatient utilization, realized at the lows of late 2010, continues to show a negative trend, as it has throughout 2011. Similar to what we disclosed to you last quarter, we're seeing outpatient physician trends creep up and move from negative into slightly positive territory. Just to put in context, remember today's trends are being compared to the lowest level of utilization trends seen in years, a historically low base line from late 2010.
And probably most importantly, our pricing structure is predicated on a forward view of trend in which we have anticipated a return to more levels -- normal levels of utilization above what we've seen in the rearview mirror. This pricing is expected to generate higher absolute rate increases than what we're seeing throughout 2011 as we've established a new baseline with many of the adjustments related to health care reform already addressed and the benefit of the extremely low utilization 2010 has already been passed through to our experience-rated customers.
Finally, the commercial results. I want to share our customary statistics around health care reform, which are consistent with the projections from the last call. For 2011, we generate total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion. Of that total, individual business generate approximately $375 million of revenue with the vast majority of this business in a rebate position. The remaining $5.6 billion of group risk revenues were split roughly 40% small group and 60% large group with approximately half of our small group business in a rebate position and a little less than 1/4 of our large group business in a rebate position.
It's important to note that rebate exposure is something that we've been managing carefully with a number of actions taken to utilize rebate capital during the year, including providing more value to our customers, also promoting quality initiatives with hospitals and providers to improve risk scores, strengthen overall quality of care and to create opportunities to lower future medical costs. This has driven our rebate estimates down significantly from our initial view in 2011. In 2012, we expect to benefit from certain renegotiated external vendor contracts, which will serve to decrease our overall cost structure and reduce our rebate accrual in 2012. We view our estimated rebate for 2011 as reasonable given the size of our book of business, this being the first year navigating these new regulations, and the inherent loss ratio variability that exists when calculated at the market side segment in the state level.
While we're not assuming a benefit from the multiple states that had minimal MLR waiver request pending with HHS, we were disappointed to see waiver request denied in some of our larger states, including Florida and Kansas. This result creates more challenging operating environment for the individual business in these markets or force us to continue to evaluate our participation in that product on a market-by-market basis. Of the states with waivers currently pending with HHS, North Carolina is the only state where Coventry has an individual presence.
Moving on to government programs, our Medicare results for the fourth quarter were a continuation of the strong results that we saw throughout 2011 and an even better result in 2010. Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 82.3% for the quarter and 82.9% for the full year was a very strong result and one that gives us confidence in our bid positioning as we look to towards 2012. Our Medicare Part D results were also strong as the fourth quarter MLR of 60.5%, full year MLR of 81.7% were both better than our expectations and an improvement from the prior year.
As Allen already highlighted, we are excited about that growth trajectory that we've built for the Medicare business with revenue growth of more than 20% and membership growth of nearly 50% in 2011. Our Medicaid results in the quarter were consistent with our expectation as we saw an uptick in our reported revenue PMPM, as well as MLR percentage, with the inclusion of the new Kentucky contract, which was effective on November 1.
Finally, we closed out 2011 with another excellent SG&A result, reporting a full year expense of $2.015 billion as compared to our initial guidance of $2.02 billion. This accomplishment is particularly impressive when you consider that while we were holding absolute SG&A spend just below our initial guidance for the year, we were simultaneously able to grow revenue above the initial guidance midpoint by more than $425 million.
Full year expense, including the elevated level of spend during the fourth quarter related to the successful Medicare enrollment period and the launch of the new Kentucky Medicaid contract, which together, bought more than 0.5 million new members to the company.
Before we get into 2012 guidance, let me first review some metrics on our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position with a net unrealized gain of $97 million at year end, an increase from $90 million in the prior quarter. As of January 31, we had $900 million of deployable free cash available, which is after retiring $234 million of senior notes earlier in January, as well as the deployment of $100 million during the fourth quarter for share repurchase. Recall that one of our accomplishments in 2011 was repositioning our balance sheet by issuing 10-year $600 million senior notes in June 2011 and renewing our credit facility. 
We have no scheduled debt maturities now until 2014, having an undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016. This gives us a great deal of flexibility as we pursue capital deployment opportunities. And as you have seen throughout 2011, while acquisitions remain our first priority for capital deployment, we're also committed to returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases, as seen through our deployment of $328 million in 2011.
Moving on to our cash flow results. You'll recall that we received an extra payment from CMS in the third quarter, so you can see the impact from that under deferred revenue line in the fourth quarter results and then in the immaterial impact from deferred revenue for the full year. The full year result was impacted by the second quarter litigation settlement. So after adjusting earnings for the litigation items, our cash flow from operations was $496 million or 112% of net income for the year. As you can see on the other receivables line of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by the timing of certain Medicare Part D receivables related to the 2011 program here that we will collect from CMS in 2012.
So with a successful 2011 behind us, let's now discuss our outlook for 2012. Today, we are providing initial 2012 EPS guidance in the range of $3.10 to $3.30, which is an increase of 8% at the low end and 15% at the high end, versus the comparable 2011 EPS of $2.87. In that area, we are projecting total revenues are nearly $14 billion, a growth of approximately $1.75 billion, which is up roughly 15% at the midpoint. We are forecasting an increase in consolidated MLR percentage, which is driven by changes in the mix across our portfolio businesses towards the growth in government programs.
In 2011, commercial revenue represented approximately 50% of the company total with an additional 30% Medicare, 10% Medicaid and 10% other, including Fee businesses. Our guidance for 2012 projects around new composition of just over 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% Fee and other. This is consistent with our goal to have a balanced portfolio with the ability to seize opportunities across the product spectrum.
On the topic of medical cost structure, we have recently renegotiated and extended our PBM contract with Medco for a multiyear period effective January 1, 2012. We're able to secure an improved cost structure and contract terms that give us more flexibility as we continue to react to the rapidly evolving health care marketplace. Given that pharmacy spend represents nearly 20% of our medical expenditures, this is an important improvement to a critical part of our overall cost structure across our product portfolio.
Moving on to SG&A. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts that the organization has put forth on driving down our SG&A percentage of revenue from 16.5% in 2011 to a midpoint of 15.4% on our 2012 guidance. I've been personally involved in working to identify cost reduction opportunities across the company that have allowed us to forecast a strong result for 2012 while simultaneously also making critical investments for the future in our core businesses. These investments include improved direct distribution capabilities from the individual business, enhanced care management tools, the addition of substantial Medicare and Medicaid resources, not to mention the ongoing increased compliance costs. And that's just to name a few.
On the non-operating items, you'll note that the tax rate is increased over 2011, which is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of earnings towards states with higher tax rates and also about compliance with new health care reform regulations.
Finally, you will see our share count guidance which assumes that we essentially hold the share count flat from where we ended 2011. It's important to note that today's EPS guidance range does not incorporate any meaningful deployment of the free cash that is sitting on our balance sheet.
Now moving more specifically into our largest lines of business. For Commercial Risk, we are forecasting membership levels to be slightly down for 2011 levels with a decrease in Q1 2012 driven by a handful of large group terminations followed by growth during the remainder of the year. We continue to price ahead of trend and remain disciplined in our objective of maintaining margin over pursuing membership gains. 
On the expense side, we are projecting MLR of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. This MLR guidance incorporates mechanics of the minimum MLR rules, our view of pricing by market, a forward view on medical trends, our mix of business and a fragmented view that you always have deviations from the mean as you manage your portfolio of 121 measurement cells. This is a slight improvement from 2011, and it's that '11 that we view as sustainable under health care reform in today's operating environment.
In Medicare, the membership story is excellent for both Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. As Allen noted earlier, we're starting the year with approximately 250,000 Medicare Advantage members, which is an impressive growth result of about 13% from 2011. Our Medicare Part D business was also very successful during the annual election period as we grew by almost 300,000 members, or about 25%, and we are forecasting continued growth throughout 2012. This growth is a nice mix of retail purchase just in our innovative new value plus product and partnership with Walgreens, Walmart and Target, as well as our increased auto-assignment presence in 23 regions for 2012, up from 15 regions in 2011. Based upon our bids and our view of where we exited 2011, we are forecasting MLRs in the low to mid-80s for both Medicare Advantage and Part D.
Staying within government programs, our 10-state Medicaid business is the biggest part of our 2012 growth story with total revenue expected to nearly double with just under $1.4 billion in 2011 to nearly $2.7 million in 2012. Today, we are just about 915,000 members and expect to be in the zone of 950,000 Medicaid members upon implementation of the new Nebraska contract. We are projecting MLR of approximately 90% in 2012, which is a combination of our same-store business, which runs in the mid- to high-80s, and MLRs in the 90s for the year 1 RFP wins and the newly acquired Family Health Partners business in the Midwest.
So now we've covered the large risk business, you'll notice that although we are still forecasting over $1.1 billion of fee-based revenue, our guidance for fee revenue is down a little, more than 3% due to the loss of one Workers' Compensation Services account. However, you also see a decrease in cost of sales expense item directly associated with Workers' Compensation Services, which more than offset the aggregate fee revenue reduction. Our Fee businesses continue to be an important component of our overall product portfolio, providing valuable unregulated cash flows and are an area that we intend to grow and adjust in prospective.
So in conclusion, our efforts in 2011 lay the foundation for the 2012 guidance that we provided today. We firmly believe that growing the top line is critical in today's environment and are pleased to see 2011's efforts bearing fruit in 2012 with the revenue guidance midpoint of nearly $14 billion, up with an increase in both operating earnings and EPS. So while we may be pleased with the 2012 growth outlook, by no means are we satisfied. We will continue to invest in the future, focus on managing our portfolio of businesses in a manner that allows us to seize growth opportunities while also maintaining the right balance, limiting our exposure to any one area. We will continue to introduce growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisition, to strategically position Coventry to deliver the long-term results that our shareholders have come to expect.
Operator, this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the line for questions."

Today, I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012, and in addition, some very brief comments and overview of 2011.
We're increasingly positive about the opportunities ahead of us, which includes our projected double-digit revenue growth in 2012. On an overall basis, we ended 2011 above our previous forecast at $3.02 of earnings per share, of which $2.87 of the EPS represents our core 2011 results, as presented in our press release, excluding the private fee-for-service runout. And we're also pleased to forecast 2012 EPS of $3.10 to $3.30, which is an 8% to 15% growth rate compared to 2011's core EPS of $2.87.
I want to spend most my time this morning talking about the 2012 and the future, which much of the groundwork is based on work that we completed in 2010 and 2011. Randy Giles, our CFO, will review the quarter and provide more detailed guidance.
 2011 is a year where we're able to surpass our early financial expectations, and more importantly, lay the foundation for prospective growth. If early 2012 financial expectations were a bit cautious, it's because it was a year marked by a transition to the first major impact of health care reform with a very considerable task of implementing minimum MLRs in our commercial business.
I'd like to begin a more detailed discussion about our future, discussing our Medicaid business and the various significant progress that we are making in seizing opportunities and growing this business.
We were awarded the Kentucky contract in July of 2011, with the contract commencing in November of the same year. Based on our positioning and network efforts throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we're able to achieve an outsized membership allocation compared to the other participants. In fact, we've grown again this past month, and we're now up to approximately 232,000 members.
One of the key elements to this recent growth was our ability to rapidly execute on building out a cost-competitive network. We're able to bring our collective resources to bear, including leveraging our centralized operational functions, and we imported one of our experienced executives to Kentucky from our existing business. The point to all this is that we're a resourceful company with over 14,000 employees with experience in all lines of business and the ability to execute simultaneous opportunities. It's really early in the Kentucky contract, and we're still refining operational processes and programs as this was a previously unmanaged population entering managed care. Even though it's really, we're very optimistic and confident that we'll have a successful partnership with the Commonwealth of Kentucky for years to come.
I want to continue on the Medicaid topic, and we have some additional news to report, which is another recent win that we would like to highlight this morning. Our company has been notified by the state of Nebraska of its intent to award a contract to Coventry to provide services for the state's expansion of the existing Medicaid managed care program. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services intends to expand managed Medicare services from the existing 10 county program to cover all 93 counties in the state, which is an estimated incremental 70,000 additional Nebraskans.
As you may recall, we won a bid in 2010 for the original program and currently serve approximately 50,000 members in the existing Medicaid program. So subject to the finalization of the contract with the state of Nebraska, we expect to be 1 of 2 managed care contractors providing services to this expanded population later this year.
Staying with Medicaid, also during 2011, we were able to seize an attractive 2-state Medicaid acquisition opportunity by acquiring Family Health Partners and entering into a long-term relationship with its previous owner, Children's Mercy of Kansas City. This acquisition, which closed effective January 1 of 2012, has Medicaid contracts in both Kansas and Missouri. We were able to expand in Missouri, a state we have served for over 15 years, and entered the Kansas Medicaid program, where there's an expansion opportunity for 2013 and beyond.
Including this acquisition, we have a meaningful multiline presence throughout our Midwest 7-state region, which now serves 1.5 million members. We were able to execute on this multifaceted transaction for a reasonable net investment of approximately $50 million, net of tax benefit and statutory capital we were able to leave behind based on the structure of this transaction.
To summarize the Medicaid discussion and quantify the growth for the year, we started 2011 with 470,000 Medicaid members and reported $1.38 billion of Medicaid revenue in 2011, which represented approximately 11% of our total revenue. We expect to double these figures with more than 915,000 members beginning in 2012 with a full year revenue forecast of around $2.7 billion.
Medicaid is projected to represent just under 20% of the company's revenue in 2012. I think that investors should think of Coventry as having a meaningful exposure to Medicare growth and penetration opportunities with a proven track record of winning new business, executing and operating these Medicaid businesses but without the concentrated risk and the inherent volatility and contract alliance of a single-line carrier. While the process of winning new business is competitive, we very strongly believe that we'll get our share in the future. We know both how to compete and how to manage this business.
Moving away from Medicaid and talking about Medicare. We're equally enthusiastic about the recent results in Medicare. As you may have seen in our press release a few weeks ago, we had a very successful 2012 annual election period. As most of you know, a lot of this work to achieve success is done well in advance. And as we have previously promised, we focused on laying the foundation during 2011 to grow both Medicare Advantage and Part D in 2012.
In Medicare Advantage, we're in 15 states, and we have seen 2012 growth across 14 of those 15 states. The most recent enrollment for Medicare Advantage is approximately 250,000 members, which is ahead of our previous estimate, and results in membership growth of about 13% so far in 2012. We've grown from 137,000 Medicare Coordinated Care members at the end of 2008 to 250,000 today for a compounded annual growth rate of 16%. We're well proportioned -- or positioned to continue taking the advantage of this attractive demographic growth opportunity where we're able to provide a tangible value proposition to seniors and to the federal government.
On Part D, we had a successful enrollment period, growing membership of about 25% out of the gate and adding almost 300,000 members.
2011, as you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the work we were doing on product design and developing, creating partnerships, and we had successfully launched the third product with a preferred network in 2012's annual election period. We increased both our auto-assign footprint and our mainstream membership coming into 2012. Our company has consistently been profitable in Part D in both membership channels since we launched in 2006, and 2011 was no exception, with an aggregate Part D loss ratio of 81.7% for the year.
During 2011, a lot of effort went into forming an attractive set of products and establishing partnerships with Walgreens, Walmart and Target for our newest product. We also renegotiated our PBM contract with an improved Part D cost structure and enhanced other areas of Part D, including distribution. I think Part D is a great example of our abilities to successfully execute on multiple growth opportunities given our focus on resources, touching multiple product lines. Our cross-functional teams went back to the drawing board after 2010 and created a product that is low-cost structure and which is proven to be attractive to the senior population.
And as you might well imagine, we're currently hard at work on our products and positioning for 2013 and very optimistic about our prospects in the future.
Think about our company with Medicare at about 30% of the company revenues and Medicaid at about 20%. So we've evolved about half of our revenue coming from government programs. There continues to be attractive opportunity to grow in the current programs, while there is a significant longer-term opportunity to serve the dual-eligible population. Medicaid and Medicare experience, footprint and capabilities are all important ingredients in positioning to serve dual eligibles. We are currently in 10 states for Medicaid and 15 states for Medicare Advantage. 8 of our 10 Medicaid states have filed letters of intent with CMS to integrate the dual-eligible population in their states. 
And for decades, we have provided complex care management and have served members across population, products and geographies with a cross-section of chronic condition, diseases and needs. We currently serve aged line to disabled members and other high-risk patients in Medicaid. We currently serve Medicaid members up and down the risk score spectrum, including dual eligibles.
Serving members with the most chronic and debilitating diseases should not be taken lightly, but this population is one that can significantly benefit by coordination of care or active chronic condition management, pharmacy management, social services and all the programs that we have built over the past decade to manage our current diverse population.
Managed care should be able to make a meaningful, positive impact on the lives of dual-eligible population, and therefore, provide a valuable -- a value proposition for the states and federal government. Based on our footprint, exposure to both Medicaid and Medicare capabilities and a history of managing diverse populations, we like our early positioning for this longer-term significant opportunity, and our company will continue to invest in Medicare and Medicaid growth, along with dual-eligible populations.
Moving to our commercial business. Our Commercial Risk revenue was up 8% for 2011 with stable membership versus 2010, which is reasonably satisfying given the first year impact of health care reform, including minimum MLRs, which were effective January 1 of last year.
We knew it wasn't going to be easy managing 121 different measurement sales in our Commercial business and dealing with the burdens imposed by the new laws and regulations, many of which fell very short on clarity coming into the beginning of 2011. As Randy Giles will cover, as expected, we ended the year with significant minimum medical loss ratio rebate accrual, which will get finalized and paid out in 2012. Our goal for 2012 and beyond in the commercial business is to maintain margin and see the growth opportunities that we expect to develop as a result of consolidating market conditions driven by a commitment in this sophistication required to operate health care in the health care reform environment.
And in this context, we're actively preparing for the potential 2014 expansion [indiscernible]. We'll continue to work on attractive commercial expansion opportunities, both through acquisitions and organic growth and increase our footprint with providers and high-performance networks, which will drive lower-cost products to complement our product portfolio.
As of today, we have signed approximately 30 high-performance network contracts across our product lines. These arrangements run the spectrum from large-scale health systems to local-based primary multispecialty provider groups. 17 of these 30 high-performance networks covers our commercial product in 14 states and we feel should position us very well, especially in an exchange environment.
As you can tell, we're very positive about our opportunities across our diverse footprint in Medicare, Medicaid and commercial lines of business. We feel that the commercial business could represent a meaningful growth opportunity in 2014 and 2015 and allow us to be diversified in addition to key substantial Medicaid and Medicare growth opportunities.
In addition, we have over $1.1 billion in higher-margin and diversified fee-based revenue that complement our risk business and provide free cash flow for deployment to increase shareholder value.
Continuing on my comments regarding our future plans, we're going to pursue organic growth in our existing businesses. We're going to pursue selected RFPs. We're going to deploy capital for acquisitions, and in addition, consider future share repurchase. I think we're not only positioned well from a business and growth perspective heading into 2012, but we also accomplished a good deal relative to our balance sheet in the past year, and Randy will address that later. We sit here with $900 million in deployable cash, and that's after posting on a meaningful transaction, buying back over 10 million shares in 2011 and paying off our 2012 note that recently came due.
We're exiting 2011 on track after increasing EPS guidance 3x during the year, and we're able to provide 2012 guidance, which results in 18% to 15% core EPS growth in 2012, coupled with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to have a strong and flexible balance sheet with a combination of free cash and additional debt capacity.
I like our positioning and balanced exposure across Medicaid, Medicare and the commercial line, as well as our capability in seeking and seizing the right M&A opportunities. We're getting results from the work we have done, and we'll continue on this path to deliver more growth.
So what does it take to deliver growth? Well, it takes capital. It takes capable, experienced executive team. It takes experience in the M&A area. It takes focus. It takes discipline. It takes the ability to move quickly. These are all capabilities our company has. I am more optimistic about our future than I have been any time in the recent past.
Randy Giles is going to walk you through the results and provide detailed guidance with additional commentary on our business. And with that, Randy?"
27133,157003674,217621,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start",2904,"Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start at the consolidated level. Our GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.60, which includes $0.02 related to the runout of the Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service business. For the full year, we reported EPS of $3.02, excluding the litigation gain in the second quarter, compared to our previous EPS guidance of $2.95 to $3. This includes $0.15 of earnings related to Private Fee-for-Service and $2.87 of core EPS for 2011.
Similar to last quarter, we have provided a table and reconciliation of these earnings metrics on Page 3 of our earnings press release. I'm very pleased with these results for 2011 as we were able to outperform our earnings guidance each quarter during the year, grew our Health Plan membership by more than 7% from the prior year, position ourselves for continued growth in 2012, deliver the largest Medicaid RFP win in the company's history and utilize the strength of our balance sheet to seize an exciting growth opportunity while repurchasing more than 7% of our outstanding share count.
These successes have positioned our portfolio of businesses very well for 2012, which I will highlight in detail after first giving you a little more color on the 2011 performance.
In our commercial business, first, one housekeeping item. You'll notice that we have now aligned our reporting of revenue PMPM and MLR percentage metrics to be consistent with the rest of the industry by disclosing Commercial Risk as opposed to our historical disclosure of Commercial Group Risk statistics, which excluded the commercial individual business. In addition to creating a better comparison to our peer group, we also wanted to recognize the growing impact that the individual business is having on our commercial results as we continue to increase our market share and invest in building out our capabilities in advance of the potential membership opportunity in the exchanges.
In 2008, for instance, we had 123,000 individual members. Whereas today, we have slightly more than 200,000 members. Also, the individual MLR has become much more comparable to the small group MLR due to health care reform regulations. This new disclosure structure is reflected in the earnings release issued this morning for both the current period as well as all historical periods disclosed.
Our commercial MLR was 83.7% in the fourth quarter and 81.6% for the full year, which is slightly above our previously provided guidance. As we continue to gain clarity on the minimum MLR regulations during the back half of 2011, we had to refine our rebate calculations to reflect the allowable underlying cost of certain internal and external medical-related vendors. We began the year expecting to be able to reflect medical-related payments to internal and external vendors in their entirety as such in the minimum MLR calculations. But based upon clarity we gained in MLR rules in Q3 and subsequent data gathering from our vendors in Q4, including our external PBM, we made adjustments that increased the medical loss ratio. I highlight this for you as it had about a 50 basis point impact on our full year 2011 commercial MLR relative to our initial guidance.
Within our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points with unit cost trend continuing to be the largest driver, albeit stable. In the rearview mirror, we can see trends the mid-7s that continue to move higher off of the extreme low levels seen during the second half of 2010. These trends include the impact of the health care reform regulations implemented on September 23, 2010, which has had between 150 and 200 basis points of impact on the trend this year that will not recur in 2012.
Inpatient utilization, realized at[indiscernible] the lows of late 2010, continues to show a negative trend, as it has throughout 2011. Similar to what we disclosed to you last quarter, we're seeing outpatient physician trends creep up and move from negative into slightly positive territory. Just to put in context, remember today's trends are being compared to the lowest level of utilization trends seen in years, a historically low base line from late 2010.
And probably most importantly, our pricing structure is predicated on a forward view of trend in which we have anticipated a return to more levels -- normal levels of utilization above what we've seen in the rearview mirror. This pricing is expected to generate higher absolute rate increases than what we're seeing throughout 2011 as we've established a new baseline with many of the adjustments related to health care reform already addressed and the benefit of the extremely low utilization late 2010 has already been passed through to our experience-rated customers.
Finally, the commercial results. I want to share our customary statistics around health care reform, which are consistent with the projections from the last call. For 2011, we generate total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion. Of that total, individual business generate approximately $375 million of revenue with the vast majority of this business in a rebate position. The remaining $5.6 billion of group risk revenues were split roughly 40% small group and 60% large group with approximately 1/2 of our small group business in a rebate position and a little less than 1/4 of our large group business in a rebate position.
It's important to note that rebate exposure is something that we've been managing carefully with a number of actions taken to utilize rebate capital during the year, including providing more value to our customers, also promoting quality initiatives with hospitals and providers to improve use scores, strengthen overall quality of care and to create opportunities to lower future medical costs. This has driven our rebate estimates down significantly from our initial view in 2011. In 2012, we expect to benefit from certain renegotiated external vendor contracts, which will serve to decrease our overall cost structure and reduce our rebate accrual in 2012. We view our estimated rebate for 2011 as reasonable given the size of our book of business, this being the first year navigating these new regulations, and the inherent loss ratio variability that exists when calculated at the market size segment and state level.
While we did not assume any benefit from the multiple states that had minimal MLR waiver request pending with HHS, we were disappointed to see waiver request denied in some of our larger states, including Florida and Kansas. This result creates a more challenging operating environment for the individual business in these markets or force us to continue to evaluate our participation in that product on a market-by-market basis. Of the states with waivers currently pending with HHS, North Carolina is the only state where Coventry has an individual presence.
Moving on to government programs, our Medicare results for the fourth quarter were a continuation of the strong results that we saw throughout 2011 and an even better result than 2010. Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 82.3% for the quarter and 82.9% for the full year was a very strong result and one that gives us confidence in our bid positioning as we look to towards 2012. Our Medicare Part D results were also strong as the fourth quarter MLR of 60.5%, full year MLR of 81.7% were both better than our expectations and an improvement from the prior year.
As Allen already highlighted, we are excited about that growth trajectory that we've built for the Medicaid business with revenue growth of more than 20% and membership growth of nearly 50% in 2011. Our Medicaid results in the quarter were consistent with our expectation as we saw an uptick in our reported revenue PMPM, as well as MLR percentage, with the inclusion of the new Kentucky contract, which was effective on November 1.
Finally, we closed out 2011 with another excellent SG&A result, reporting a full year expense of $2.015 billion as compared to our initial guidance of $2.02 billion. This accomplishment is particularly impressive when you consider that while we were holding absolute SG&A spend just below our initial guidance for the year, we were simultaneously able to grow revenue above the initial guidance midpoint by more than $425 million.
Full year expense, including the elevated level of spend during the fourth quarter related to the successful Medicare enrollment period and the launch of the new Kentucky Medicaid contract, which together, bought more than 0.5 million new members to the company.
Before we get into 2012 guidance, let me first review some metrics on our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position with a net unrealized gain of $97 million at year end, an increase from $90 million in the prior quarter. As of January 31, we had $900 million of deployable free cash available, which is after retiring $234 million of senior notes earlier in January, as well as the deployment of $100 million during the fourth quarter for share repurchase. Recall that one of our accomplishments in 2011 was repositioning our balance sheet by issuing 10-year $600 million senior notes in June 2011 and renewing our credit facility. 
We have no scheduled debt maturities now until 2014, having an undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016. This gives us a great deal of flexibility as we pursue capital deployment opportunities. And as you have seen throughout 2011, while acquisitions remain our first priority for capital deployment, we're also committed to returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases, as seen through our deployment of $328 million in 2011.
Moving on to our cash flow results. You'll recall that we received an extra payment from CMS in the third quarter, so you can see the impact from that on the deferred revenue line in the fourth quarter results and then in the immaterial impact from deferred revenue for the full year. The full year result was impacted by the second quarter litigation settlement. So after adjusting earnings for the litigation items, our cash flow from operations was $496 million or 112% of net income for the year. As you can see on the other receivables line of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by the timing of certain Medicare Part D receivables related to the 2011 program year that we will collect from CMS in 2012.
So with a successful 2011 behind us, let's now discuss our outlook for 2012. Today, we are providing initial 2012 EPS guidance in the range of $3.10 to $3.30, which is an increase of 8% at the low end and 15% at the high end, versus the comparable 2011 EPS of $2.87. In that aggregate, we are projecting total revenues are nearly $14 billion, a growth of approximately $1.75 billion, which is up roughly 15% at the midpoint. We are forecasting an increase in consolidated MLR percentage, which is driven by changes in the mix across our portfolio businesses towards the growth in government programs.
In 2011, commercial revenue represented approximately 50% of the company total with an additional 30% Medicare, 10% Medicaid and 10% other, including Fee businesses. Our guidance for 2012 projects around new composition of just over 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% Fee and other. This is consistent with our goal to have a balanced portfolio with the ability to seize opportunities across the product spectrum.
On the topic of medical cost structure, we have recently renegotiated and extended our PBM contract with Medco for a multiyear period effective January 1, 2012. We were able to secure an improved cost structure and contract terms that give us more flexibility as we continue to react to the rapidly evolving health care marketplace. Given that pharmacy spend represents nearly 20% of our medical expenditures, this is an important improvement to a critical part of our overall cost structure across our product portfolio.
Moving on to SG&A. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts that the organization has put forth on driving down our SG&A percentage of revenue from 16.5% in 2011 to a midpoint of 15.4% on our 2012 guidance. I've been personally involved in working to identify cost reduction opportunities across the company that have allowed us to forecast a strong result for 2012 while simultaneously also making critical investments for the future in our core businesses. These investments include improved direct distribution capabilities from the individual business, enhanced care management tools, the addition of substantial Medicare and Medicaid resources, not to mention the ongoing increased compliance costs. And that's just to name a few.
On the non-operating items, you'll note that the tax rate is increased over 2011, which is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of earnings towards states with higher tax rates and also about compliance with new health care reform regulations.
Finally, you will see our share count guidance which assumes that we essentially hold the share count flat from where we ended 2011. It's important to note that today's EPS guidance range does not incorporate any meaningful deployment of the free cash that is sitting on our balance sheet.
Now moving more specifically into our largest lines of business. For Commercial Risk, we are forecasting membership levels to be slightly down for 2011 levels with a decrease in Q1 2012 driven by a handful of large group terminations followed by growth during the remainder of the year. We continue to price ahead of trend and remain disciplined in our objective of maintaining margin over pursuing membership gains. 
On the expense side, we are projecting MLR of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. This MLR guidance incorporates mechanics of the minimum MLR rules, our view of pricing by market, a forward view on medical trends, our mix of business and a pragmatic view that you always have deviations from the mean as you manage your portfolio of 121 measurement cells. This is a slight improvement from 2011, and it's that '11 that we view as sustainable under health care reform in today's operating environment.
In Medicare, the membership story is excellent for both Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. As Allen noted earlier, we're starting the year with approximately 250,000 Medicare Advantage members, which is an impressive growth result of about 13% from 2011. Our Medicare Part D business was also very successful during the annual election period as we grew by almost 300,000 members, or about 25%, and we are forecasting continued growth throughout 2012. This growth is a nice mix of retail purchases in our innovative new value plus product and partnership with Walgreens, Walmart and Target, as well as our increased auto-assignment presence in 23 regions for 2012, up from 15 regions in 2011. Based upon our bids and our view of where we exited 2011, we are forecasting MLRs in the low to mid-80s for both Medicare Advantage and Part D.
Staying within government programs, our 10-state Medicaid business is the biggest part of our 2012 growth story with total revenue expected to nearly double from just under $1.4 billion in 2011 to nearly $2.7 billion in 2012. Today, we are just about 915,000 members and expect to be in the zone of 950,000 Medicaid members upon implementation of the new Nebraska contract. We are projecting MLR of approximately 90% in 2012, which is a combination of our same-store business, which runs in the mid- to high-80s, and MLRs in the 90s for the year 1 RFP wins and the newly acquired Family Health Partners business in the Midwest.
So now we've covered the large risk business, you'll notice that although we are still forecasting over $1.1 billion of fee-based revenue, our guidance for fee revenue is down a little, more than 3% due to the loss of one Workers' Compensation Services account. However, you also see a decrease in cost of sales expense item directly associated with Workers' Compensation Services, which more than offset the aggregate fee revenue reduction. Our Fee businesses continue to be an important component of our overall product portfolio, providing valuable unregulated cash flows and are an area that we intend to grow and invest in prospective.
So in conclusion, our efforts in 2011 lay the foundation for the 2012 guidance that we provided today. We firmly believe that growing the top line is critical in today's environment and are pleased to see 2011's efforts bearing fruit in 2012 with the revenue guidance midpoint of nearly $14 billion, coupled with an increase in both operating earnings and EPS. So while we may be pleased with the 2012 growth outlook, by no means are we satisfied. We will continue to invest in the future, focus on managing our portfolio of businesses in a manner that allows us to seize growth opportunities while also maintaining the right balance, limiting our exposure to any one area. We will continue to introduce growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisition, to strategically position Coventry to deliver the long-term results that our shareholders have come to expect.
Operator, this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the line for questions."

Today, I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012, and in addition, some very brief comments and overview of 2011.We're increasingly positive about the opportunities ahead of us",2272,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Today, I'd like to share with you our outlook for 2012, and in addition, some very brief comments and overview of 2011.
We're increasingly positive about the opportunities ahead of us, which includes our projected double-digit revenue growth in 2012. On an overall basis, we ended 2011 above our previous forecast at $3.02 of earnings per share, of which $2.87 of the EPS represents our core 2011 results, as presented in our press release, excluding the private fee-for-service runout. And we're also pleased to forecast 2012 EPS of $3.10 to $3.30, which is an 8% to 15% growth rate compared to 2011's core EPS of $2.87.
I want to spend most my time this morning talking about the 2012 and the future, which much of the groundwork is based on work that we completed in 2010 and 2011. Randy Giles, our CFO, will review the quarter and provide more detailed guidance.
 2011 is a year where we're able to surpass our early financial expectations, and more importantly, lay the foundation for prospective growth. If early 2012 financial expectations were a bit cautious, it's because it was a year marked by a transition to the first major impact of health care reform with a very considerable task of implementing minimum MLRs in our commercial business.
I'd like to begin a more detailed discussion about our future, discussing our Medicaid business and the various significant progress that we are making in seizing opportunities and growing this business.
We were awarded the Kentucky contract in July of 2011, with the contract commencing in November of the same year. Based on our positioning and network efforts throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we're able to achieve an outsized membership allocation compared to the other participants. In fact, we've grown again this past month, and we're now up to approximately 232,000 members.
One of the key elements to this recent growth was our ability to rapidly execute on building out a cost-competitive network. We're able to bring our collective resources to bear, including leveraging our centralized operational functions, and we imported one of our experienced executives to Kentucky from our existing business. The point to all this is that we're a resourceful company with over 14,000 employees with experience in all lines of business and the ability to execute simultaneous opportunities. It's really early in the Kentucky contract, and we're still refining operational processes and programs as this was a previously unmanaged population entering managed care. Even though it's really, we're very optimistic and confident that we'll have a successful partnership with the Commonwealth of Kentucky for years to come.
I want to continue on the Medicaid topic, and we have some additional news to report, which is another recent win that we would like to highlight this morning. Our company has been notified by the state of Nebraska of its intent to award a contract to Coventry to provide services for the state's expansion of the existing Medicaid managed care program. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services intends to expand managed Medicare services from the existing 10 county program to cover all 93 counties in the state, which is an estimated incremental 70,000 additional Nebraskans.
As you may recall, we won a bid in 2010 for the original program and currently serve approximately 50,000 members in the existing Medicaid program. So subject to the finalization of the contract with the state of Nebraska, we expect to be 1 of 2 managed care contractors providing services to this expanded population later this year.
Staying with Medicaid, also during 2011, we were able to seize an attractive 2-state Medicaid acquisition opportunity by acquiring Family Health Partners and entering into a long-term relationship with its previous owner, Children's Mercy of Kansas City. This acquisition, which closed effective January 1 of 2012, has Medicaid contracts in both Kansas and Missouri. We were able to expand in Missouri, a state we have served for over 15 years, and entered the Kansas Medicaid program, where there's an expansion opportunity for 2013 and beyond.
Including this acquisition, we have a meaningful multiline presence throughout our Midwest 7-state region, which now serves 1.5 million members. We were able to execute on this multifaceted transaction for a reasonable net investment of approximately $50 million, net of tax benefit and statutory capital we were able to leave behind based on the structure of this transaction.
To summarize the Medicaid discussion and quantify the growth for the year, we started 2011 with 470,000 Medicaid members and reported $1.38 billion of Medicaid revenue in 2011, which represented approximately 11% of our total revenue. We expect to double these figures with more than 915,000 members beginning in 2012 with a full year revenue forecast of around $2.7 billion.
Medicaid is projected to represent just under 20% of the company's revenue in 2012. I think that investors should think of Coventry as having a meaningful exposure to Medicare growth and penetration opportunities with a proven track record of winning new business, executing and operating these Medicaid businesses but without the concentrated risk and the inherent volatility and contract alliance of a single-line carrier. While the process of winning new business is competitive, we very strongly believe that we'll get our share in the future. We know both how to compete and how to manage this business.
Moving away from Medicaid and talking about Medicare. We're equally enthusiastic about the recent results in Medicare. As you may have seen in our press release a few weeks ago, we had a very successful 2012 annual election period. As most of you know, a lot of this work to achieve success is done well in advance. And as we have previously promised, we focused on laying the foundation during 2011 to grow both Medicare Advantage and Part D in 2012.
In Medicare Advantage, we're in 15 states, and we have seen 2012 growth across 14 of those 15 states. The most recent enrollment for Medicare Advantage is approximately 250,000 members, which is ahead of our previous estimate, and results in membership growth of about 13% so far in 2012. We've grown from 137,000 Medicare Coordinated Care members at the end of 2008 to 250,000 today for a compounded annual growth rate of 16%. We're well proportioned -- or positioned to continue taking the advantage of this attractive demographic growth opportunity where we're able to provide a tangible value proposition to seniors and to the federal government.
On Part D, we had a successful enrollment period, growing membership of about 25% out of the gate and adding almost 300,000 members.
2011, as you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the work we were doing on product design and developing, creating partnerships, and we had successfully launched the third product with a preferred network in 2012's annual election period. We increased both our auto-assign footprint and our mainstream membership coming into 2012. Our company has consistently been profitable in Part D in both membership channels since we launched in 2006, and 2011 was no exception, with an aggregate Part D loss ratio of 81.7% for the year.
During 2011, a lot of effort went into forming an attractive set of products and establishing partnerships with Walgreens, Walmart and Target for our newest product. We also renegotiated our PBM contract with an improved Part D cost structure and enhanced other areas of Part D, including distribution. I think Part D is a great example of our abilities to successfully execute on multiple growth opportunities given our focus on resources, touching multiple product lines. Our cross-functional teams went back to the drawing board after 2010 and created a product that is low-cost structure and which is proven to be attractive to the senior population.
And as you might well imagine, we're currently hard at work on our products and positioning for 2013 and very optimistic about our prospects in the future.
Think about our company with Medicare at about 30% of the company revenues and Medicaid at about 20%. So we've evolved about half of our revenue coming from government programs. There continues to be attractive opportunity to grow in the current programs, while there is a significant longer-term opportunity to serve the dual-eligible population. Medicaid and Medicare experience, footprint and capabilities are all important ingredients in positioning to serve dual eligibles. We are currently in 10 states for Medicaid and 15 states for Medicare Advantage. 8 of our 10 Medicaid states have filed letters of intent with CMS to integrate the dual-eligible population in their states. 
And for decades, we have provided complex care management and have served members across population, products and geographies with a cross-section of chronic condition, diseases and needs. We currently serve aged line to disabled members and other high-risk patients in Medicaid. We currently serve Medicaid members up and down the risk score spectrum, including dual eligibles.
Serving members with the most chronic and debilitating diseases should not be taken lightly, but this population is one that can significantly benefit by coordination of care or active chronic condition management, pharmacy management, social services and all the programs that we have built over the past decade to manage our current diverse population.
Managed care should be able to make a meaningful, positive impact on the lives of dual-eligible population, and therefore, provide a valuable -- a value proposition for the states and federal government. Based on our footprint, exposure to both Medicaid and Medicare capabilities and a history of managing diverse populations, we like our early positioning for this longer-term significant opportunity, and our company will continue to invest in Medicare and Medicaid growth, along with dual-eligible populations.
Moving to our commercial business. Our Commercial Risk revenue was up 8% for 2011 with stable membership versus 2010, which is reasonably satisfying given the first year impact of health care reform, including minimum MLRs, which were effective January 1 of last year.
We knew it wasn't going to be easy managing 121 different measurement sales in our Commercial business and dealing with the burdens imposed by the new laws and regulations, many of which fell very short on clarity coming into the beginning of 2011. As Randy Giles will cover, as expected, we ended the year with significant minimum medical loss ratio rebate accrual, which will get finalized and paid out in 2012. Our goal for 2012 and beyond in the commercial business is to maintain margin and see the growth opportunities that we expect to develop as a result of consolidating market conditions driven by a commitment in this sophistication required to operate health care in the health care reform environment.
And in this context, we're actively preparing for the potential 2014 expansion [indiscernible]. We'll continue to work on attractive commercial expansion opportunities, both through acquisitions and organic growth and increase our footprint with providers and high-performance networks, which will drive lower-cost products to complement our product portfolio.
As of today, we have signed approximately 30 high-performance network contracts across our product lines. These arrangements run the spectrum from large-scale health systems to local-based primary multispecialty provider groups. 17 of these 30 high-performance networks covers our commercial product in 14 states and we feel should position us very well, especially in an exchange environment.
As you can tell, we're very positive about our opportunities across our diverse footprint in Medicare, Medicaid and commercial lines of business. We feel that the commercial business could represent a meaningful growth opportunity in 2014 and 2015 and allow us to be diversified in addition to key substantial Medicaid and Medicare growth opportunities.
In addition, we have over $1.1 billion in higher-margin and diversified fee-based revenue that complement our risk business and provide free cash flow for deployment to increase shareholder value.
Continuing on my comments regarding our future plans, we're going to pursue organic growth in our existing businesses. We're going to pursue selected RFPs. We're going to deploy capital for acquisitions, and in addition, consider future share repurchase. I think we're not only positioned well from a business and growth perspective heading into 2012, but we also accomplished a good deal relative to our balance sheet in the past year, and Randy will address that later. We sit here with $900 million in deployable cash, and that's after posting on a meaningful transaction, buying back over 10 million shares in 2011 and paying off our 2012 note that recently came due.
We're exiting 2011 on track after increasing EPS guidance 3x during the year, and we're able to provide 2012 guidance, which results in 18% to 15% core EPS growth in 2012, coupled with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to have a strong and flexible balance sheet with a combination of free cash and additional debt capacity.
I like our positioning and balanced exposure across Medicaid, Medicare and the commercial line, as well as our capability in seeking and seizing the right M&A opportunities. We're getting results from the work we have done, and we'll continue on this path to deliver more growth.
So what does it take to deliver growth? Well, it takes capital. It takes capable, experienced executive team. It takes experience in the M&A area. It takes focus. It takes discipline. It takes the ability to move quickly. These are all capabilities our company has. I am more optimistic about our future than I have been any time in the recent past.
Randy Giles is going to walk you through the results and provide detailed guidance with additional commentary on our business. And with that, Randy?"
27133,157003674,218001,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start",2904,"Thank you, Allen. I'll begin this morning by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter and then spend a majority of my time reviewing our detailed guidance for 2012. Before I go through the details for each of our businesses, I want to first start at the consolidated level. Our GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.60, which includes $0.02 related to the runout of the Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service business. For the full year, we reported EPS of $3.02, excluding the litigation gain in the second quarter, compared to our previous EPS guidance of $2.95 to $3. This includes $0.15 of earnings related to Private Fee-for-Service and $2.87 of core EPS for 2011.
Similar to last quarter, we have provided a table and reconciliation of these earnings metrics on Page 3 of our earnings press release. I'm very pleased with these results for 2011 as we were able to outperform our earnings guidance each quarter during the year, grew our Health Plan membership by more than 7% from the prior year, position ourselves for continued growth in 2012, deliver the largest Medicaid RFP win in the company's history and utilize the strength of our balance sheet to seize an exciting growth opportunity while repurchasing more than 7% of our outstanding share count.
These successes have positioned our portfolio of businesses very well for 2012, which I will highlight in detail after first giving you a little more color on the 2011 performance.
In our commercial business, first, one housekeeping item. You'll notice that we have now aligned our reporting of revenue PMPM and MLR percentage metrics to be consistent with the rest of the industry by disclosing Commercial Risk as opposed to our historical disclosure of Commercial Group Risk statistics, which excluded the commercial individual business. In addition to creating a better comparison to our peer group, we also wanted to recognize the growing impact that the individual business is having on our commercial results as we continue to increase our market share and invest in building out our capabilities in advance of the potential membership opportunity in the exchanges.
In 2008, for instance, we had 123,000 individual members. Whereas today, we have slightly more than 200,000 members. Also, the individual MLR has become much more comparable to the small group MLR due to health care reform regulations. This new disclosure structure is reflected in the earnings release issued this morning for both the current period as well as all historical periods disclosed.
Our commercial MLR was 83.7% in the fourth quarter and 81.6% for the full year, which is slightly above our previously provided guidance. As we continue to gain clarity on the minimum MLR regulations during the back half of 2011, we had to refine our rebate calculations to reflect the allowable underlying cost of certain internal and external medical-related vendors. We began the year expecting to be able to reflect medical-related payments to internal and external vendors in their entirety as such in the minimum MLR calculations. But based upon clarity we gained in MLR rules in Q3 and subsequent data gathering from our vendors in Q4, including our external PBM, we made adjustments that increased the medical loss ratio. I highlight this for you as it had about a 50 basis point impact on our full year 2011 commercial MLR relative to our initial guidance.
Within our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points with unit cost trend continuing to be the largest driver, albeit stable. In the rearview mirror, we can see trends the mid-7s that continue to move higher off of the extreme low levels seen during the second half of 2010. These trends include the impact of the health care reform regulations implemented on September 23, 2010, which has had between 150 and 200 basis points of impact on the trend this year that will not recur in 2012.
Inpatient utilization, realized at[indiscernible] the lows of late 2010, continues to show a negative trend, as it has throughout 2011. Similar to what we disclosed to you last quarter, we're seeing outpatient physician trends creep up and move from negative into slightly positive territory. Just to put in context, remember today's trends are being compared to the lowest level of utilization trends seen in years, a historically low base line from late 2010.
And probably most importantly, our pricing structure is predicated on a forward view of trend in which we have anticipated a return to more levels -- normal levels of utilization above what we've seen in the rearview mirror. This pricing is expected to generate higher absolute rate increases than what we're seeing throughout 2011 as we've established a new baseline with many of the adjustments related to health care reform already addressed and the benefit of the extremely low utilization late 2010 has already been passed through to our experience-rated customers.
Finally, the commercial results. I want to share our customary statistics around health care reform, which are consistent with the projections from the last call. For 2011, we generate total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion. Of that total, individual business generate approximately $375 million of revenue with the vast majority of this business in a rebate position. The remaining $5.6 billion of group risk revenues were split roughly 40% small group and 60% large group with approximately half of our small group business in a rebate position and a little less than 1/4 of our large group business in a rebate position.
It's important to note that rebate exposure is something that we've been managing carefully with a number of actions taken to utilize rebate capital during the year, including providing more value to our customers, also promoting quality initiatives with hospitals and providers to improve risk scores, strengthen overall quality of care and to create opportunities to lower future medical costs. This has driven our rebate estimates down significantly from our initial view in 2011. In 2012, we expect to benefit from certain renegotiated external vendor contracts, which will serve to decrease our overall cost structure and reduce our rebate accrual in 2012. We view our estimated rebate for 2011 as reasonable given the size of our book of business, this being the first year navigating these new regulations, and the inherent loss ratio variability that exists when calculated at the market size segment and state level.
While we did not assume any benefit from the multiple states that had minimal MLR waiver request pending with HHS, we were disappointed to see waiver request denied in some of our larger states, including Florida and Kansas. This result creates a more challenging operating environment for the individual business in these markets or force us to continue to evaluate our participation in that product on a market-by-market basis. Of the states with waivers currently pending with HHS, North Carolina is the only state where Coventry has an individual presence.
Moving on to government programs, our Medicare results for the fourth quarter were a continuation of the strong results that we saw throughout 2011 and an even better result than 2010. Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 82.3% for the quarter and 82.9% for the full year was a very strong result and one that gives us confidence in our bid positioning as we look to towards 2012. Our Medicare Part D results were also strong as the fourth quarter MLR of 60.5%, full year MLR of 81.7% were both better than our expectations and an improvement from the prior year.
As Allen already highlighted, we are excited about that growth trajectory that we've built for the Medicaid business with revenue growth of more than 20% and membership growth of nearly 50% in 2011. Our Medicaid results in the quarter were consistent with our expectation as we saw an uptick in our reported revenue PMPM, as well as MLR percentage, with the inclusion of the new Kentucky contract, which was effective on November 1.
Finally, we closed out 2011 with another excellent SG&A result, reporting a full year expense of $2.015 billion as compared to our initial guidance of $2.02 billion. This accomplishment is particularly impressive when you consider that while we were holding absolute SG&A spend just below our initial guidance for the year, we were simultaneously able to grow revenue above the initial guidance midpoint by more than $425 million.
Full year expense, including the elevated level of spend during the fourth quarter related to the successful Medicare enrollment period and the launch of the new Kentucky Medicaid contract, which together, bought more than 0.5 million new members to the company.
Before we get into 2012 guidance, let me first review some metrics on our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position with a net unrealized gain of $97 million at year end, an increase from $90 million in the prior quarter. As of January 31, we had $900 million of deployable free cash available, which is after retiring $234 million of senior notes earlier in January, as well as the deployment of $100 million during the fourth quarter for share repurchase. Recall that one of our accomplishments in 2011 was repositioning our balance sheet by issuing 10-year $600 million senior notes in June 2011 and renewing our credit facility. 
We have no scheduled debt maturities now until 2014, having an undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016. This gives us a great deal of flexibility as we pursue capital deployment opportunities. And as you have seen throughout 2011, while acquisitions remain our first priority for capital deployment, we're also committed to returning capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases, as seen through our deployment of $328 million in 2011.
Moving on to our cash flow results. You'll recall that we received an extra payment from CMS in the third quarter, so you can see the impact from that on the deferred revenue line in the fourth quarter results and then in the immaterial impact from deferred revenue for the full year. The full year result was impacted by the second quarter litigation settlement. So after adjusting earnings for the litigation items, our cash flow from operations was $496 million or 112% of net income for the year. As you can see on the other receivables line of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by the timing of certain Medicare Part D receivables related to the 2011 program year that we will collect from CMS in 2012.
So with a successful 2011 behind us, let's now discuss our outlook for 2012. Today, we are providing initial 2012 EPS guidance in the range of $3.10 to $3.30, which is an increase of 8% at the low end and 15% at the high end, versus the comparable 2011 EPS of $2.87. In that aggregate, we are projecting total revenues are nearly $14 billion, a growth of approximately $1.75 billion, which is up roughly 15% at the midpoint. We are forecasting an increase in consolidated MLR percentage, which is driven by changes in the mix across our portfolio businesses towards the growth in government programs.
In 2011, commercial revenue represented approximately 50% of the company total with an additional 30% Medicare, 10% Medicaid and 10% other, including Fee businesses. Our guidance for 2012 projects around new composition of just over 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% Fee and other. This is consistent with our goal to have a balanced portfolio with the ability to seize opportunities across the product spectrum.
On the topic of medical cost structure, we have recently renegotiated and extended our PBM contract with Medco for a multiyear period effective January 1, 2012. We were able to secure an improved cost structure and contract terms that give us more flexibility as we continue to react to the rapidly evolving health care marketplace. Given that pharmacy spend represents nearly 20% of our medical expenditures, this is an important improvement to a critical part of our overall cost structure across our product portfolio.
Moving on to SG&A. I'm particularly pleased with the efforts that the organization has put forth on driving down our SG&A percentage of revenue from 16.5% in 2011 to a midpoint of 15.4% on our 2012 guidance. I've been personally involved in working to identify cost reduction opportunities across the company that have allowed us to forecast a strong result for 2012 while simultaneously also making critical investments for the future in our core businesses. These investments include improved direct distribution capabilities from the individual business, enhanced care management tools, the addition of substantial Medicare and Medicaid resources, not to mention the ongoing increased compliance costs. And that's just to name a few.
On the non-operating items, you'll note that the tax rate is increased over 2011, which is primarily driven by a shift in the mix of earnings towards states with higher tax rates and also about compliance with new health care reform regulations.
Finally, you will see our share count guidance which assumes that we essentially hold the share count flat from where we ended 2011. It's important to note that today's EPS guidance range does not incorporate any meaningful deployment of the free cash that is sitting on our balance sheet.
Now moving more specifically into our largest lines of business. For Commercial Risk, we are forecasting membership levels to be slightly down for 2011 levels with a decrease in Q1 2012 driven by a handful of large group terminations followed by growth during the remainder of the year. We continue to price ahead of trend and remain disciplined in our objective of maintaining margin over pursuing membership gains. 
On the expense side, we are projecting MLR of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. This MLR guidance incorporates mechanics of the minimum MLR rules, our view of pricing by market, a forward view on medical trends, our mix of business and a pragmatic view that you always have deviations from the mean as you manage your portfolio of 121 measurement cells. This is a slight improvement from 2011, and it's that '11 that we view as sustainable under health care reform in today's operating environment.
In Medicare, the membership story is excellent for both Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. As Allen noted earlier, we're starting the year with approximately 250,000 Medicare Advantage members, which is an impressive growth result of about 13% from 2011. Our Medicare Part D business was also very successful during the annual election period as we grew by almost 300,000 members, or about 25%, and we are forecasting continued growth throughout 2012. This growth is a nice mix of retail purchases in our innovative new value plus product and partnership with Walgreens, Walmart and Target, as well as our increased auto-assignment presence in 23 regions for 2012, up from 15 regions in 2011. Based upon our bids and our view of where we exited 2011, we are forecasting MLRs in the low to mid-80s for both Medicare Advantage and Part D.
Staying within government programs, our 10-state Medicaid business is the biggest part of our 2012 growth story with total revenue expected to nearly double from just under $1.4 billion in 2011 to nearly $2.7 billion in 2012. Today, we are just about 915,000 members and expect to be in the zone of 950,000 Medicaid members upon implementation of the new Nebraska contract. We are projecting MLR of approximately 90% in 2012, which is a combination of our same-store business, which runs in the mid- to high-80s, and MLRs in the 90s for the year 1 RFP wins and the newly acquired Family Health Partners business in the Midwest.
So now we've covered the large risk business, you'll notice that although we are still forecasting over $1.1 billion of fee-based revenue, our guidance for fee revenue is down a little, more than 3% due to the loss of one Workers' Compensation Services account. However, you also see a decrease in cost of sales expense item directly associated with Workers' Compensation Services, which more than offset the aggregate fee revenue reduction. Our Fee businesses continue to be an important component of our overall product portfolio, providing valuable unregulated cash flows and are an area that we intend to grow and invest in prospective.
So in conclusion, our efforts in 2011 lay the foundation for the 2012 guidance that we provided today. We firmly believe that growing the top line is critical in today's environment and are pleased to see 2011's efforts bearing fruit in 2012 with the revenue guidance midpoint of nearly $14 billion, coupled with an increase in both operating earnings and EPS. So while we may be pleased with the 2012 growth outlook, by no means are we satisfied. We will continue to invest in the future, focus on managing our portfolio of businesses in a manner that allows us to seize growth opportunities while also maintaining the right balance, limiting our exposure to any one area. We will continue to introduce growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisition, to strategically position Coventry to deliver the long-term results that our shareholders have come to expect.
Operator, this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the line for questions."

Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first",2361,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first quarter last year. And earnings per share of $1.20 driven by strength across 6 of our 7 businesses, specially our Medicare Advantage business. 
As you can see in our current Medicaid Medical loss ratio, we had some serious work to do in our recently added Medicaid business, but all of Coventry's other businesses: Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and our Fee-based businesses were on track or ahead of plan for the quarter. With regard to SG&A, we closed a t a very strong result with the rate of 13.6%, which is down 280 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. 
Today, I'd like to touch on each of our businesses and share with you our current perspective and probably more importantly where we're heading. And let's start with Medicare. The strength of the quarter in terms of Medicare Advantage was primarily driven by 3 factors: A very successful open enrollment season, which resulted in sequential membership growth of 13% or 28,000 members. The second was a very favorable outcome from the risk adjustment data validation audit process persistent to methodology changes issued by CMS during the quarter enabling us to reduce our related reserve that were built over the last several years. And third, strong operating results in Medicare Advantage even absent the operating earnings driven by the RADV reserve release. 
I believe it's worth a moments thing on Medicare Advantage. We operate Medicare Advantage Health Plans at 15 states. 14 of these states growing coming into 2012. We're pleased with the momentum of this business and expect to continue to expand our footprint and membership base over the next few years. We have taken what we believe was a prudent posture over the last few years and accruing our best estimate of RADV liability even in the absence of perfect parity. 
The update in guidance from CMS were able to reflect the reduction in the RADV reserve of $133 million or $0.58 per share contributing to strong Medicare operating results in the quarter. This is important for a couple of reasons. First of all, it should give you insight into the prudence and reserving for this type of exposure, which I believe was not necessarily consistent industrywide. And perhaps more important, we were able to substantially reduce a headwind in our Medicare Advantage bids since we'll now adapt to the updated CMS RADV guidance. 
As we look ahead, this, along with strong execution and performance of our Medicare business to continue to support the competitiveness of our Medicare Advantage products. 
Other Medicare business, Part D, also had a very good first quarter. Coventry has national Part D footprint and is #5 nationwide in market share. As you may recall from the open enrollment period coming into 2012, we're able to expand our auto-assigned footprint from 15 to 23 regions and launched a third product with a preferred network creating attractive value proposition for seniors. And results were very satisfying. We grew 28% sequentially in the first quarter 2012, ending 315,000 members. Our Part D medical loss ratio is consistent with prior year Q1 and on track for the first full year forecast of low to the mid-80s of medical loss ratios.
Our combined and Medicare business represents approximately $4.3 billion of annual revenue or about 30% of the company's total revenue. From our perspective, Medicare has an attractive growth and margin profile and we're all to an excellent start in 2012.
Moving onto our Fee-based businesses, Coventry's diversified across 3 business signs: Workers' Compensation service, employee administration and Rental Network. Our Fee business has produced over $1.1 billion in free revenue with higher-margin characteristics that are risk business. First quarter of 2012 was slightly ahead of our previous plan and as you can see, we increased our forecast of fee revenue for the full year. These Fee business is an important part of our diversified portfolio and they generate strong earnings upon unregulated cash flow. 
Moving onto our Commercial business. We continue to focus on building and signing new contracts for high performance networks as I've covered last quarter. Regardless of the outcome of reform, we believe driving to low-cost structure will best position Coventry, enable us to create products to provide a compelling value proposition for both employees, and individuals as an employer groups. We currently saw a Group commercial products through health plans in 25 states. We spend the last 6 years in developing individual products and capabilities and currently sell individual products alongside our historically strong group products in all of those states. 
The gaining factor for Coventry ending a commercial market, either organically or through acquisition, is cost structure. In many cases a network oppose a cost structure is a key asset in an acquisition and often negotiated as a part of a transaction. In other cases, we're able to use a collective set of Company assets including our locally based health plans and other national businesses to maintain a top tier cost structure and existing markets and negotiate favorable cost structure in new markets. We expect our high performance networks to play an important part in both the existing and new markets. 
Ultimately, we look forward to seizing growth driven by the Health Care Reform jump ball, or quickly adopted Health Care Reform cost changes. 
Nimbleness and local marker intelligence through our Health Plan presence is historically been a key strength in our commercial Health Plan business for at least 15 years. We expect our efforts will position us for success regardless of the direction of Health Care Reform. 
I'm moving on to Medicaid. Our Medicaid business is experienced significant growth coming into 2012. We're currently in 10 states covering members and program spanning, temporary aid in needy families, age blinds and disabled, bills and chip members. Coventry's managed Medicaid populations and programs since the early days have state based managed care adoption over a decade and a half ago. Our Medicaid experience solutions certainly contributed to Coventry's successful pre-procurement of Missouri, our largest state presence in terms of membership which was announced by the state of Missouri during the first quarter. In addition, we look forward to adding to our position in Nebraska later in 2012 based on the when discussed in our last conference call. 
We also today has some news to report on the Medicaid RFP fee from. This week, our Pennsylvania subsidiary Health America was awarded 2 letters of intent to contract which will cover new managed care regions in eastern and Western Pennsylvania. As you may recall, we already have a Medicaid footprint in south eastern and southwestern Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has selected 4 carriers in the West for a targeted effective date of September 1, 2012, to manage approximately 165,000 eligibles. Pre-carriers are selected in the east including Health America for a targeted implementation in Q1 2013 to manage approximately 215,000 eligibles. 
So as a result, we look forward to serving our share of the 380,000 members when these programs live. 
Our mature Medicaid business performed consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. With respect to our new Medicaid businesses, as you will recall close to Family Health Partners acquisition on January 1 of this year which our results reflect the first few months of our ownership there. I'm pleased with our relationship with Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, key partner in providing quality care to children in Missouri and Kansas. As you would expect, this relationship was certainly an important element of the transaction. The integration of the acquired business is on track 3 months post closing and a successful procurement outcome in Missouri is a very good start to this acquisition. 
Our remaining relatively new Medicaid business is Kentucky, which is for us producing very negative financial results. Actually we're getting our tails kicked. Kentucky is in early stages of the 36-month contract, which was effective November 1, 2011. Now that we have 5 months of data, it's clear that our poor financial results really result from 3 areas: one of which was anticipated and 2 of which were not. First area is a result of adverse risk selection. How did this happen? Well the RFP which responded to and all other bidders responded to, required a robust list of contractor providers in all 7 regions in order to bid. If the response was an adequate in any 1 of the 7 regions, responding companies would've been eliminated for all regions. Coventry responded in this stringent standard and compiled in all regions even though the provider cost and health status of the Commonwealth of Kentucky citizens is more challenging in regions 7 and 8. Not all company selected responded the matter in the matter that we did but nevertheless allowed to participate in all regions. And the result was what you expect which we received a disproportionate number of members with high utilization enrolled in high-cost systems. Our company also exacerbated our problem by being the only carrier not to require copayments in pharmacy.
In the RFP, the Commonwealth of Kentucky committed to an appropriate risk adjustment mechanism to adjust or partially adjust for pre-reverse risk whether this time, we've been unable to cope obtain a commitment for compensation which would address the adverse risk action required by the contract that we have with them. As discussion is ongoing and while we cannot be specific as to the timing, we feel that this discussions will be successful. The second and unanticipated area was at least one air from the Commonwealth that the book and we bid the business with regard to passthrough payments to hospital for medical education. This was clearly an oversight with the Commonwealth and while we have not been able to obtain agreement from the Kentucky at this time, from this front, what we believe we will ultimately be successful and obtain adjustment for this hospital past prepayments.
Third area is the basics of managed care, which was anticipated. How do we take better care of members in a more cost-effective manner? It was expected and we now have the data to address the basics of approved care for the members and the initiative Tessera to control costs and improve care. These areas include pharmaceutical abuses, mental health issues, too many non par providers and so many other areas. We are currently working on about 50 initiatives, which will deliver value to the Kentucky Medicaid program and improve outcomes for the members.
Bottom line, we're confident our discussions with a Commonwealth of Kentucky and our Medicaid issues will make this a viable program for the future. Hopefully you've listened carefully to our discussion about Kentucky as we will not entertain any questions on this subject during the Q&A portion. We're obviously on an ongoing discussion with the Commonwealth of Kentucky in many areas as well as many providers and it would be inappropriate to talk about details of these discussions in this forum. 
One more thought on Kentucky. It's important to reiterate that the population previously operated and completely unmonitored earlier., only talk about the members but also positions especially vendors, pharmacies and so on. About assure you that we resources of the company to Baird the work of the Commonwealth an appropriate solutions such as proper risk adjustment and fair and equal treatment on implementing dozens of healthcare initiatives should bring medical cost down perspectively. More resources our company finding the proper long-term solution, make it financially sound and workable  while improving the care for the members. And while we work on improvements in Kentucky, our other diversified business continue to perform well and we're seeking out and other selective growth opportunities across our broad set of businesses. 
Our balance sheet is in excellent condition as I referenced in the last earning call with the reduced level of debt and we currently have $900 million of deployable cash on hand as of March 31, as well as an untapped credit facility of $750 million. At the regularly scheduled board meeting in mid-March, we spent time on capital deployment avenues including M&A, share repurchase and is the first time in the companies history our board approved the dividend to complement these other methods of delivering value to our shareholders. Those of you who are shareholders as of March 23, should have received your first quarterly dividend on April 9. While the level of cash generated on our businesses and our capitalization we believe we can continue to value to shareholders and M&A share repurchase while also provided for dividend that today analyzes to approximately $7 million. Recap our first quarter capital deployment activity we close and acquisition, a down $234 million of debt and declared our first shareholder dividend. We are planning to continue with the share repurchase program beginning in Q2 at level somewhere 2012, absent any compelling M&A opportunities or other usage. While we are evaluate and react each quarter to needs and opportunities, we are committed to a continuation of capital deployment. I'm really pleased with the position by diversified set the businesses and resulting opportunities that should be able to seize over the next few years and Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, eligibles and potential opportunities in the commercial market. In addition to the companies organic opportunities, we'll also selectively deploy capital to grow our business footprint. The benefit of having us set of well diversified businesses in a strong balance sheet, is a strength that allows us to invest to new opportunities and survive the challenges that New Ventures often bring. While I'm disappointed in the early start of the Kentucky contract, we will continue to seek new Medicaid opportunities along with growing our other businesses to bring the long-term value necessary for owners. And with those comments, I'll conclude my part of the presentation and our Chief Financial Officer, Randy Giles, will take you through the financials. Randy?"
27133,204626278,291007,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings",2718,"Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.20, which include the $0.58 benefit in the release of the reserves related to RADV as Allen described in his prepared remarks and $0.62 of earnings generated by the company's operations excluding the RADV item. As you saw on this morning's earnings release, our full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $3.10 to $3.30 inclusive of favorable impact of the RADV reserve release as well as other updates that will detail further in my commentary this morning.
It's important to note that this guidance range does not reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchases in 2012 beyond those required the whole share count flat as where we ended 2011. Our consolidated revenue guidance now exceeds $14 billion at the midpoint with the similar mix of business roughly 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% being other. As in our previous guidance, we're reflecting movement to a more balanced mix over 2011. This strategically diversification across our balanced portfolio of businesses gives us a flexibility to adapt to today's fluid regulatory environment and seize opportunities across the products spectrum.
The results for the first quarter of 2012 were characterized by performance meeting or exceeding our expectations in 6 out of our 7 core businesses, with an outstanding result on SG&A as our cost control efforts coupled with leveraging top line growth continue to bear fruit for the organization. Our Q1 revenue of $3.7 billion, which is ahead of our previous guidance range drove the increase to our full year guidance midpoint $14.1 billion in revenue, which would be a record revenue level for the company reflecting a significant acceleration of the company's growth rate over 2011. 
Starting with the Commercial business. First quarter MLR of 79.9%, keeps us on track for a full year MLR guidance range of 81% to 82%. This is consistent with the 81.6% result that we reported for full year 2011 which was the first year impacted by minimum MLRs relations. We are currently projecting total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion for the year. The individual business expected to generate approximately $425 million of that total. The remaining group risk revenues are expected to be roughly 40% small group and 60% large group, consistent with the mix that we saw in 2011. We currently estimate that approximately 25% of our Commercial Risk revenue is in the rebate position today. We will continue to evaluate strategies to effectively utilize rebate capital by providing more value to our customers, improving the attractiveness of our products, providing quality initiatives with hospitals and physicians to improve SEDAR scores, and the initiative to reduce future Healthcare cost. The thing in our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In the rearview mirror, we are seeing trends in the high sevens and continue to migrate higher in the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010 consistent with what we shared with you last quarter. Again these trends include the impact from the healthcare reform regulations implemented the September 23, 2010, which was fully incorporated into the current period were only partially included in the baseline. 
In the cost trend, which continues to be the larger driver of overall trend is stable. As we look at trend by component, in the first quarter we saw a slightly negative trend for inpatient days per thousand and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive prospectively, which is consistent with our prior prospective view given the historically low comparison levels that we're seeing during 2011. Utilization trends that we are seeing in the outpatient position categories continues to show signs of a slight increase similar to what we have observed over the last 2 quarters both remaining is slightly positive territory. This migration from negative outpatient physician utilization trend slightly positive as been gradually and has been anticipated in our pricing. 
Before I leave the commercial business, there is one other item that I would like to highlight this morning. In the first quarter, we signed a binding term sheet with Magellan's NIA subsidiary spending our strategic partnership, radiology, management services. This term sheet, renewed agreements that were set to expire the near-term structured overall terms of the agreement significantly lowered our capitative medical cost for this category of service. 
Moving on to government programs. Our Medicare results for the first quarter were driven by outstanding performance during the annual election period which I'd like to highlight in a little more detail. Starting with Medicare Part D. We solidified our number 5 national market share with the third highest absolute growth in the industry and the second highest growth on a percentage basis among our large peers as our innovative new product first help value plus enrolled approximately 375,000 members, increasing our total Part D membership to $1,158,000 at quarter end. We like our position for 2012 and expect to continue the Part D membership throughout the remainder of 2012. 
We're also pleased with enrollment results for our locally contracted Medicare Advantage products as we added 28,000 new members, which was the third is percentage growth, our large competitors including growth in 1 of our 15 states increasing total Medicare Advantage Membership to 250,000 members at quarter end.
Medicare Advantage MLR of 74.1% reported or 82.9% for the quarter, excluding the favorable impact from RADV reserve releases is clearly a very strong start of the year consistent with our full year MLR guidance excluding RADV impact in the mid-to low 80s. This result were supported by mid-single digit reduction in days per thousand from the prior year quarter. Medicare part D results for the first quarter was also strong. In terms of growth our MLR of 94.9% keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance in the low to mid-80s. 
We'll now discuss our Medicaid business in detail as we saw MLR in the first quarter that I want to address and also talk about some of the initiatives that we're working on to improve these results throughout the remainder of 2012. First, let me remind you that we have Medicaid business in test is to date the total Medicaid Membership of 924,000 at quarter end, which is increased by 97% from the prior year quarter as we work towards our goal of enrolling 1 million Medicaid members. With the exception of the ramp-up in Kentucky, our Medicaid business is performing well both in terms of organic membership growth and MLR performance. MLR outline some of the challenges that we are experiencing Kentucky which I would like now elaborate on. Our outdated guidance incorporates a projection for Medicaid MLR in the mid-90s for the full year, increase from our previous guidance of approximately 90% driven entirely by Kentucky. As we discussed in the fourth quarter 2011 earnings call, the Commonwealth of Kentucky quickly transitioned a highly unmanaged Medicaid population to managed care November 2011. Coventry build on this business is always an underlying assumption that projected historically elevated to spending levels and through the implementation of the traditional managed care protocols an improvement of patient care reducing both excessive utilization and wasteful spending over time. This process has been more challenging than we have forecast. As our reported MLR in the first quarter 2012 were 120.9% is higher than what we recorded the fourth quarter of 2011. We like to reiterate Allen's comments that we are very disappointed in this outcome. We are focused many other companies senior executives in addressing the situation. We have also strengthen our management in the ground significant resources. Reasons that I'm sure you'd understand I could not get into specifics in this decision that we're having with the Commonwealth but let me broadly outline for you but we are doing both in terms of the revenue side as well as medical cost initiatives. On the revenue side, we're in discussions with a Commonwealth are under appropriate mechanism for risk adjustment payments as stipulated in our contract. At this point, it also remains unclear whether these payments are going to be made retroactively to the contract an inception date or whether it be perspective owner. 
Also working to address certain date the book areas some example supplemental payments which we have more match our revenue with underlying cost structure dynamics of this contract. And finally, as we disclosed previously, we have a 5.3% rate increase which will take effect on October 1 of this year. 
On the expense side, our management team and some of our top clinical professionals and other areas of organization are fully engaged in implementing more than 50 real-time ongoing action items based upon emerging data to address higher cost areas. This cleared the pharmacy behavioral health cause in particular exceeding our previous book projections now that we have a stable population based been able to effectively deploy our solutions for these specific pressure areas. As an example do run with a pharmacy costs should benefit from an ongoing increase in generic utilization through all major branded drugs converting to generic here in 2012. We've also develop initiatives to address areas is up your questionable prescribing patterns which is all part of turning unmanaged program into managed care. Our summer initiative network construction profiling and collaboration efforts, fraud and abuse increased pre authorization process, increasing member cost-sharing and so on. In the first quarter, the rules around transitional care from the unmanaged period ended -- we are now able to implement processes to improve care coordination and manage cost. Also in the first quarter, the reimbursement level for non-part for writers was reduced from 100% and the Kentucky Medicaid fee is scheduled to 90%. On extensive list of other initiatives as well covering all categories of expense as being worked on every day and evaluated by senior management. But all of these are not things that we can turn around immediately, we expect continued improvement during 2012 to resolve matters with a Commonwealth and bring run rate with cost down based upon the initiatives outlined above. We're actually focused of rectifying this isolated situation. 
Before I conclude my Medicaid commentary, I would like to highlight that 75% of our membership with the resides in other states other than Kentucky's performing well both in terms of financial results in terms of seizing growth opportunities. In the last earnings call, we highlighted our contract to win Nebraska and market share and be the only participant with the statewide presence when that contract commences in the third quarter of this year. Also announced a new contract in Pennsylvania commencing during the second quarter as we were awarded entry into the Southwest region of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program, Health Choices. We began enrolling new members on April 1 and that region expect to gradually grow our market share through auto assignment somewhat growing presence in the Southeast region. I'm excited to announce that on the heels that are launched in that Southwest region we were just notified recently as Allen mentioned but we have been awarded significant letters of intent to contract in both the new west,  new east zones of Pennsylvania as well with total Medicaid of approximately 380,000. U.S. contracts is expected to commence in September then the New East contract beginning in March of 2013 not expect to have a material impact on our financial results for 2012. While our winning Missouri was at this air only new business our very pleased our Medicaid team is able to obtain #1 market position in that state including the recently acquired Family Health Partners business which represents our largest presence in terms of membership today. 
Now moving on to our fee-based businesses. Our updated guidance incorporates an improved view of management services revenue driven by higher than expected revenue Workers' Compensation business as well as their Paul Ridzon Health Plan ASO. Increase in our guidance for the cost of sales line item reflects a portion of growth that we are seeing Worker's Compensation services. Our fee businesses are an important part of our product portfolio strategy driving the reverification from our large risk base business with valuable unregulated cash flows and area that we intend to grow and invest in prospectively. 
SG&A results for the quarter and corresponding full year guidance reflect the continued progress that the company is making towards cost structured that we believe is an important Coventry's long-term strategy. For the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $502.9 million, 13.6% of revenue driven by careful management of headcount and other cost even as we continue to grow the top line revenue. In addition, we are seeing increased traction our broker pass through strategy the commercial group business which is an official impact on our SG&A expense levels. Our revised full year SG&A guidance midpoint of 14.9% of revenue is an improvement of 160 basis points from 202011 is particularly satisfying when you considered additional expense that we are incurring with compliance with new healthcare regulations, investments in our recently added businesses, as well as increasing investments that we're making for future growth. 
The full year guidance include our normal assumption for elevated level spent during the fourth quarter related to the Medicare a be through typical January 11 expenses for the Commercial Risk business. As you saw in this morning's press release, our cash flow from operations for the quarter is $420.5 million, 246% of net income. This result include the receipt of an extra payment from CMS in the quarter as well as a positive adjustment related to the RADV reserve release. Adjusting for the site if our cash flow from operations is $123 million or more typical 139% of net income. 
Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position for the first quarter as the net unrealized gain of $100 million in March 31, an increase from $97 million at the end of 2011. At the end of the quarter we have $900 million of deployable cash flow is a parent consistent with the level that we just disclosed in our prior earnings call which was as of January 31. As usual, the second quarter will begin our annual regulated subsidiary dividend process. First quarter was quite an uneventful one on the capital deployment front. We began was a Family Court partners acquisition early January, we paid off our $234 million senior notes that came due later the month. On March 12, the companies now dividend in its history which was subsequently paid on April 9. I mentioned that we committed to point capital to our share repurchase beginning the second quarter and targeting levels comparable to 2011. Important to note that our PPS guidance range does not include anticipated share repurchases in 2012 down those required the whole flat where we ended 2011. Acquisition within our top priority to use our cash was dividend share repurchase reflecting our goal of maintaining a well-balanced capital deployment strategy. 
Debt to cap is at a very reasonable level 25.2% at quarter end. We have an undrawn $750 million credit facility with the scheduled to expire doing 2016, which combined with our free cash of $900 million provides capacitive $1.65 billion and significant financial flexibility as we evaluate perspective opportunity. 
In conclusion, I'm encouraged to see significant progress being made across all of our businesses as we work towards our 2012 financial objectives position the company for tomorrow. We have tripled our projected revenue growth rate part of prior year. We've added more than $700,000 new members as compared to the prior year quarter. With personally focus on identifying the right investments for the future pursuing growth opportunities across our portfolio businesses and improving our financial performance of existing businesses the strength in the company to produce long-term value for our shareholders. Operator this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the lines for questions."

Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first",2380,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first quarter of last year. And earnings per share of $1.20 driven by strength across 6 of our 7 businesses, specially our Medicare Advantage business. 
As you can see in our current Medicaid medical loss ratio, we had some serious work to do in our recently added Medicaid business, but all of Coventry's other businesses: Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and our Fee-based businesses were on track or ahead of plan for the quarter. With regard to SG&A, we closed at a very strong result with the rate of 13.6%, which is down 280 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. 
Today, I'd like to touch on each of our businesses and share with you our current perspective and probably more importantly where we're heading. And let's start with Medicare. The strength of the quarter in terms of Medicare Advantage was primarily driven by 3 factors: A very successful open enrollment season, which resulted in sequential membership growth of 13% or 28,000 members. The second was a very favorable outcome from the risk adjustment data validation audit process proceed to methodology changes issued by CMS during the quarter enabling us to reduce our related reserve that were built over the last several years. And third, strong operating results in Medicare Advantage even absent the operating earnings driven by the RADV reserve release. 
I believe it's worth a moments staying on Medicare Advantage. We operate Medicare Advantage Health Plans in 15 states. 14 of these states growing coming into 2012. We're pleased with the momentum of this business and expect to continue to expand our footprint and membership base over the next few years. We have taken what we believe was a prudent posture over the last few years and accruing our best estimate of RADV liability even in the absence of perfect clarity. 
The update in guidance from CMS were able to reflect the reduction in the RADV reserve of $133 million or $0.58 per share contributing to the strong Medicare operating results in the quarter. This is important for a couple of reasons. First of all, it should give you insight into the prudence in reserving for this type of exposure, which I believe was not necessarily consistent industrywide. And perhaps more important, we were able to substantially reduce a headwind in our Medicare Advantage bids since we'll now adapt to the updated CMS RADV guidance. 
As we look ahead, this, along with strong execution and performance of our Medicare business to continue to support the competitiveness of our Medicare Advantage products. 
Other Medicare business, Part D, also had a very good first quarter. Coventry has a national Part D footprint and is #5 nationwide in market share. As you may recall from the open enrollment period coming into 2012, we're able to expand our auto-assigned footprint from 15 to 23 regions and launched a third product with a preferred network creating attractive value proposition for seniors. And the results were very satisfying. We grew 28% sequentially in the first quarter 2012, ending 315,000 members. Our Part D medical loss ratio is consistent with prior year Q1 and on track for the first full year forecast of low to the mid-80s of medical loss ratios.
Our combined and Medicare business represents approximately $4.3 billion of annual revenue or about 30% of the company's total revenue. From our perspective, Medicare has an attractive growth and margin profile and where all did an excellent start in 2012.
Moving on to our Fee-based businesses, Coventry's diversified across 3 business signs: Workers' Compensation service, better employee administration and Rental Network. Our Fee businesses produced over $1.1 billion in free revenue with higher-margin characteristics than our Risk business. First quarter of 2012, was slightly ahead of our previous plan and as you can see, we increased our forecast of fee revenue for the full year. These Fee businesses are important part of our diversified portfolio and they generate strong earnings upon unregulated cash flow. 
Moving onto our Commercial business. We continue to focus on building and signing new contracts for high performance networks, as I've covered last quarter. Regardless of the outcome of reform, we believe driving to a low-cost structure will best position Coventry, enable us to create products to provide a compelling value proposition for both employees, [indiscernible] individuals and employer groups. We currently sell a Group commercial products through our health plans in 25 states. We spent the last 6 years developing individual products and capabilities and currently sell individual products alongside our historically strong Group products in all of those states. 
The gaining factor for Coventry ending a commercial market, either organically or through acquisition, is cost structure. In many cases a network oppose of cost structure is a key asset in an acquisition and often negotiated as a part of a transaction. In other cases, we're able to use a collective set of Company assets including our locally-based health plans and other national businesses to maintain a top tier cost structure and existing markets and negotiate favorable cost structure in new markets. We expect our high performance networks to play an important part in both the existing and new markets. 
Ultimately, we look forward to seizing growth driven by the Health Care Reform jump ball, or quickly adopt a Health Care Reform cost changes. 
Nimbleness and local marker intelligence through our Health Plan presence is historically been a key strength in our commercial Health Plan business for at least 15 years. We expect our efforts will position us for success regardless of the direction of Health Care Reform. 
I'm moving on to Medicaid. Our Medicaid business has experienced significant growth coming into 2012. We're currently in 10 states carrying members in program spanning, temporary aid in needy families, age blind and disabled, bills and CHIP members. Coventry's Health stage managed Medicaid populations and programs since the early days of state-based managed care adoption over 1.5 decade. Our Medicaid experience in solutions certainly contributed to Coventry's successful pre-procurement of Missouri, our largest state presence in terms of membership which was announced by the state of Missouri during the first quarter. In addition, we look forward to adding to our position in Nebraska later in 2012, based on the when discussed in our last conference call. 
We also today has some news to report on the Medicaid RFP front. This week, our Pennsylvania subsidiary Health America, was awarded 2 letters of intent to contract which will cover new managed care regions in Eastern and Western Pennsylvania. As you may recall, we already have a Medicaid footprint in South Eastern and Southwestern Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has selected 4 carriers in the West for a targeted effective date of September 1, 2012, to manage approximately 165,000 eligibles. Pre-carriers are selected in the East including Health America for a targeted implementation date in Q1 2013 to manage approximately 215,000 eligibles. 
So as a result, we look forward to serving our share of the 380,000 members when these programs go live. 
Our mature Medicaid business performed consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. With respect to our new Medicaid businesses, as you will recall close to Family Health Partners acquisition on January 1 of this year, which our results reflect the first few months of our ownership there. I'm pleased with our relationship with Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, key partner in providing quality care to children in Missouri and Kansas. As you would expect, this relationship was certainly an important element of the transaction. The integration of the acquired business is on track 3 months post closing and a successful procurement outcomes in Missouri was a very good start to this acquisition. 
Our remaining relatively new Medicaid business is Kentucky, which is for us producing very negative financial results. Actually we're getting our tails kicked. Kentucky is on early stages of the 36-month contract, which was effective November 1, 2011. Now that we have 5 months of data, it's clear that our poor financial results really result from 3 areas: one of which was anticipated and 2 of which were not. First area is a result of adverse risk selection. How did this happen? Well the RFP which we responded to and all other bidders responded to, required a robust list of contractor providers in all 7 regions in order to bid. If the response was inadequate in any one of the 7 regions, responding companies would've been eliminated for all regions. Coventry responded in this stringent standard and compiled in all regions, even though the provider cost and health status of the Commonwealth of Kentucky citizens is more challenging in regions 7 and 8. Not all company selected responded to the matter in the matter that we did but were nevertheless allowed to participate in all regions. And the result was what you would expect, which is we received a disproportionate number of members with high utilization enrolled in high-cost systems. Our company also exacerbated our problem by being the only carrier not to require copayments in pharmacy.
In the RFP, the Commonwealth of Kentucky committed to an appropriate risk adjustment mechanism to adjust or partially adjust to pre-adverse risk but at this time, we've been unable to obtain their commitment for compensation which would address the adverse risk selection as required by the contract that we have with them. As discussion is ongoing and while we cannot be specific as to the timing, we feel that this discussions will be successful. 
The second and unanticipated area was at least one error from the Commonwealth's data book when we bid the business with regard to pass-through payments to hospital for medical education. This was clearly an oversight with the Commonwealth and while we have not been able to attain agreement from Kentucky at this time, from this front, we believe we will ultimately be successful and obtain adjustment for this hospital pass-through payments.
Third area is the basics of managed care, which was anticipated. How do we take better care of members in a more cost-effective manner? It was expected and we now have the data to address the basics of approved care for the members and the initiative necessary to control costs and improve care. These areas include pharmaceutical abuses, mental health issues, too many non par providers and so many other areas. We are currently working on about 50 initiatives, which will deliver value to the Kentucky Medicaid program and improve outcomes for the members.
Bottom line, we're confident our discussions with a Commonwealth of Kentucky and our medical initiatives will make this a viable program for the future. Hopefully you've listened carefully to our discussion about Kentucky as we will not entertain any questions on this subject during the Q&A portion. We're obviously on an ongoing discussion with the Commonwealth of Kentucky in many areas as well as many providers and it would be inappropriate to talk about details of these discussions in this forum. 
One more thought on Kentucky. It's important to reiterate that the population previously operated in a completely unmanaged arena. And I'm not only talking about the members but also physicians especially vendors, pharmacies and so on. I want to assure you that we bet all the resources of the company to bear the work with the Commonwealth on appropriate solutions such as proper risk adjustment and fair and equal treatment on implementing dozens of healthcare initiatives should bring medical cost down perspectively. More resources our company are focused on finding the proper long-term solution, make it financially sound and workable  while improving the care for the members. But while we work on improvements in Kentucky, our other diversified business continue to perform well and we're seeking out an other selective growth opportunities across our broad set of businesses. 
Our balance sheet is in excellent condition as I referenced in the last earning call with the reduced level of debt. And we currently have $900 million of deployable cash on hand as of March 31, as well as an untapped credit facility of $750 million. At the regularly scheduled Board meeting in mid-March, we spent time on capital deployment avenues including M&A, share repurchase and for the first time in the companies history our Board approved the dividend to complement these other methods of delivering value to our shareholders. Those of you who are shareholders as of March 23, should have received your first quarterly dividend on April 9. 
While the level of cash generated in our businesses and our capitalization, we believe we continue to deliver value to shareholders and M&A share repurchase while also providing for dividend that today analyzes to approximately $70 million. 
Recap our first quarter capital deployment activity we close on acquisition, paid down $234 million of debt and declared our first shareholder dividend. We are planning to continue with the share repurchase program beginning in Q2 at level somewhere 2012, absent any compelling M&A opportunities or other usage. While we will evaluate and react each quarter to needs and opportunities, we are committed to a continuation of capital deployment. I'm really pleased with the position with our diversified set the businesses and resulting opportunities that we should be able to seize over the next few years in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, bill eligibles and potential opportunities in the commercial market. 
In addition to the companies organic opportunities, we'll also selectively deploy capital to grow our business footprint. The benefit of having a set of well diversified businesses and a strong balance sheet, is a strength which allows us to invest to new opportunities and survive the challenges that new ventures often bring. While I'm disappointed in the early start of the Kentucky contract, we will continue to seek new Medicaid opportunities along with growing our other businesses to bring the long-term value necessary for owners. And with those comments, I'll conclude my part of the presentation and our Chief Financial Officer, Randy Giles, will take you through the financials. Randy?"
27133,204626278,291319,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings",2813,"Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.20, which include the $0.58 benefit from the release of the reserves related to RADV as Allen described in his prepared remarks and $0.62 of earnings generated by the company's operations excluding the RADV item. 
As you saw on this morning's earnings release, our full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $3.10 to $3.30 inclusive of favorable impact of the RADV reserve release as well as other updates that I will detail further in my commentary this morning.
It's important to note that this guidance range does not reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchases in 2012, beyond those required the whole share count flat was where we ended 2011. Our consolidated revenue guidance now exceeds $14 billion at the midpoint with the similar mix of business roughly 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% being other. As in our previous guidance, we're reflecting movement to a more balanced mix over 2011. This strategically diversification across our balanced portfolio of businesses gives us a flexibility to adapt to today's fluid regulatory environment and seize opportunities across the products spectrum.
The results for the first quarter of 2012, were characterized by performance meeting or exceeding our expectations in 6 out of our 7 core businesses, with an outstanding result on SG&A as our cost control efforts coupled with leveraging top line growth continue to bear fruit for the organization. Our Q1 revenue of $3.7 billion, which is ahead of our prior guidance range drove the increase to our full year guidance midpoint $14.1 billion in revenue, which would be a record revenue level for the company reflecting a significant acceleration in the company's growth rate over 2011. 
Starting with the Commercial business. First quarter MLR of 79.9%, keeps us on track for a full year MLR guidance range of 81% to 82%. This is consistent with the 81.6% result that we reported for full year 2011, which was the first year impacted by minimum MLRs regulations. We are currently projecting total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion for the year. The individual business expected to generate approximately $425 million of that total. The remaining Group risk revenues are expected to be roughly 40% small group and 60% large group, consistent with the mix that we saw in 2011. We currently estimate that approximately 25% of our Commercial Risk revenue is in the rebate position today. We will continue to evaluate strategies to effectively utilize rebate capital by providing more value to our customers, improving the attractiveness of our products, promoting quality initiatives with hospitals and physicians to improve HEDIS scores, and initiatives to reduce future Healthcare cost. 
Staying at our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In the rearview mirror, we are seeing trends in the high 7s and have continued to migrate higher from the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010 consistent with what we shared with you last quarter. Again these trends include the impact from the healthcare reform regulations implemented the September 23, 2010, which are fully incorporated into the current period but are only partially included in the baseline. 
In the cost trend, which continues to be the largest driver of overall trend is stable. As we look at trend by component, in the first quarter we saw a slightly negative trend for inpatient days per thousand and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive prospectively, which is consistent with our prior prospective view given the historically low comparison levels that we're seeing during 2011. 
Utilization trends that we are seeing in the outpatient position categories continues to show signs of a slight increase similar to what we've observed over the last 2 quarters with both remaining in slightly positive territory. This migration from negative outpatient physician utilization trend slightly positive has been gradual and has been anticipated in our pricing. 
Before I leave the Commercial business, there's one other item that I would like to highlight this morning. In the first quarter, we signed a binding term sheet with Magellan's NIA subsidiary [indiscernible] expanding our strategic partnership, radiology management services. This term sheet, renewed agreements that were set to expire the near-term restructured the overall terms of the agreement to significantly lower our capitative medical cost for this category of service. 
Moving on to government programs. Our Medicare results for the first quarter were driven by outstanding performance during the annual election period which I'd like to highlight in a little more detail. Starting with Medicare Part D. We solidified our number 5 national market share with the third highest absolute growth in the industry and the second highest growth on a percentage basis among our large peers as our innovative new product First Health Value Plus enrolled approximately 375,000 members, increasing our total Part D membership to $1,158,000 at quarter end. We like our positioning for 2012 and expect to continue to grow Part D membership throughout the remainder of 2012. 
We're also pleased with enrollment results for our locally-contracted Medicare Advantage products as we added 28,000 new members, which was the third best percentage growth among our large competitors and included growth in all the -- 1 of our 15 states increasing total Medicare Advantage Membership to 250,000 members at our quarter end.
Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 74.1% reported or 82.9% for the quarter, excluding the favorable impact from RADV reserve releases was clearly a very strong start of the year consistent with our full year MLR guidance excluding RADV impact in the mid-to low 80s. This result were supported by mid-single digit reduction in days per thousand from the prior year quarter. Our Medicare part D results for the first quarter were also strong in terms of growth and our MLR of 94.9% keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance in the low to mid-80s. 
I will now discuss our Medicaid business in detail as we saw MLR pressure in the first quarter that I want to address and also talk about some of the initiatives that we're working on to improve these results throughout the remainder of 2012. First, let me remind you that we have Medicaid business in 10 states to date with total Medicaid Membership of 924,000 at quarter end, which is increased by 97% from the prior year quarter as we work towards our goal of enrolling 1 million Medicaid members. 
With the exception of the ramp-up in Kentucky, our Medicaid business is performing well both in terms of organic membership growth and MLR performance. Allen already outlined some of the challenges that we are experiencing Kentucky which I would like to now elaborate on. 
Our outdated guidance incorporates a projection for Medicaid MLR in the mid-90s for the full year, increase from our previous guidance of approximately 90% driven entirely by Kentucky. As we discussed in the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings call, the Commonwealth of Kentucky quickly transitioned a highly unmanaged Medicaid population to Manage Care in November 2011. 
When Coventry bid on this business, there was always an underlying assumption that projected taking historically elevated to spending levels and through the implementation of traditional Manage Care protocols an improvement of patient care reducing both excessive utilization and wasteful spending over time. This process has been more challenging than we have forecasted, as our reported MLR in the first quarter 2012 of 120.9% was higher than what we recorded in fourth quarter of 2011. I would like to reiterate Allen's comment that we are very disappointed in this outcome. And we've focused many of the company's senior executives in addressing the situation. We have also strengthen management on the ground and continued to add significant resources. For reasons that I'm sure you'd understand I cannot get into specifics on the discussions that we're having with the Commonwealth but let me broadly outline for you what we are doing both in terms of the revenue side as well as on medical cost initiatives. 
On the revenue side, we're in discussions with the Commonwealth around the appropriate mechanism for risk adjustment payments as stipulated in our contract. At this point, it also remains unclear whether these payments will be made retroactively to the contract inception date or whether it'll be prospective only. 
We're also working to address certain data book errors, for example around supplemental payments which would more properly match our revenue with underlying cost structure dynamics of this contract. And finally, as we disclosed previously, we have a 5.3% rate increase which will take effect on October 1 of this year. 
On the expense side, our management team and some of our top clinical professionals from other areas of the organization are fully engaged in implementing more than 50 real-time ongoing action items based upon emerging data to address higher cost areas. 
This cleared the pharmacy in behavioral health cost, in particular, are exceeding our previous projections. And now that we have a stable population based, we've been able to more effectively deploy our solutions for these specific pressure areas. 
As an example, the run rate of pharmacy costs should benefit from an ongoing increase in generic utilization as well as 4 major branded drugs converting to generic during 2012. We've also develop initiatives to address areas which appeared to have questionable prescribing patterns which is all part of turning an unmanaged program into Manage Care. 
We have similar initiatives covering network construction, provider profiling and collaboration efforts, fraud and abuse,  an increased pre authorization process, increase in member cost-sharing and so on. 
During the first quarter, the rules around transitional care from the unmanaged period ended. We are now able to implement processes to improve care coordination and manage cost. Also in the first quarter, the reimbursement level for non par providers was reduced from 100% that the Kentucky Medicaid fee is scheduled to 90%. 
We have an extensive list of other initiatives as well, covering all categories of healthcare expense. They are being worked on every day and evaluated by senior management. Though all these are not things that we can turn around immediately, we expect continued improvement during 2012, as we resolve matters with the Commonwealth and bring run rate with cost down based upon the initiatives outlined above. We're actually focused of rectifying this isolated situation. 
Before I conclude my Medicaid commentary, I would like to highlight the 75% of our membership which resides states other than Kentucky that is performing well both in terms of financial results in terms of seizing growth opportunities. In the last earnings call, we highlighted our contract to win Nebraska, where we will have the #1 market share and be the only participant with the statewide presence when that contract commences in the third quarter of this year. 
We also announced a new contract in Pennsylvania commencing during the second quarter as we were awarded entry into the Southwest region of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program, Health Choices. We began enrolling new members on April 1, and that region expect to gradually grow our market share there through auto assignment similar to our growing presence in the Southeast region. I'm excited to announce that on the heels of our launched in that Southwest region, we were just notified recently, as Allen mentioned that we have been awarded significant letters of intent to contract in both the New West and New East zones of Pennsylvania as well with total Medicaid eligibles of approximately 380,000. The newest contract is expected to commence in September with the New East contract beginning in March of 2013. They're not expected to have a material impact on our financial results for 2012. 
While our winning Missouri was not necessarily a new business, I'm very pleased that our Medicaid team is able to attain a #1 market position in that state including the recently acquired Family Health Partners business which represents our largest presence in terms of membership today. 
Now moving on to our Fee-based businesses. Our updated guidance incorporates an improved view of management services revenue driven by higher than expected revenue from our Workers' Compensation business as well as their volumes in Health Plan ASO. The increase in our guidance for the cost of sales line item reflects a portion of growth that we are seeing Worker's Compensation services. Our Fee businesses are an important part of our product portfolio strategy providing reversification from our large risk base business with valuable unregulated cash flows and earn on area that we intend to grow and invest in prospectively. 
Our SG&A results for the quarter and corresponding full year guidance reflect the continued progress that the company is making towards driving a low cost structure that we believe is the most critical component of Coventry's long-term strategy. 
For the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $502.9 million or 13.6% of revenue driven by careful management of headcount and other cost even as we continue to grow the top line revenue. In addition, we are seeing increased traction in our broker pass-through strategy, the Commercial Group business which has a beneficial impact on our SG&A expense levels. 
Our revised full year SG&A guidance midpoint of 14.9% of revenue is an improvement of 160 basis points from 2011 and is particularly satisfying when you considered additional expense that we are incurring for compliance with new healthcare regulations, investments in our recently added businesses, as well as increasing investments that we're making for future growth. 
The full year guidance includes our normal assumption for an elevated level spend during the fourth quarter related to the Medicare A and B, as well as typical January 1 renewal expenses for the Commercial Risk business. 
As you saw on this morning's press release, our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $420.5 million or 246% of net income. This results include the receipt of an extra payment from CMS in the quarter as well as a positive adjustment related to the RADV reserve release. So after adjusting for these items, our cash flow from operations was $123 million or more typical 139% of net income. 
Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position for the first quarter with the net unrealized gain of $100 million in March 31, an increase from $97 million at the end of 2011. At the end of the quarter we have $900 million of deployable free cash that's apparent, consistent with the level that we just disclosed in our prior earnings call which was as of January 31. 
As usual, during the second quarter we'll begin our annual regulated subsidiary dividend process. The first quarter was quite an eventful one on the capital deployment front. To begin, we closed the Family Health Partners acquisition early January, then we paid off our $234 million of senior notes that came due later in the month. Finally on March 12, the company announced our first dividend in its history which was subsequently paid on April 9. 
As Allen mentioned, we are also committed to point capital per share repurchase beginning in the second quarter and targeting levels comparable to 2011. It's important to note that our PPS guidance range does not include anticipated share repurchases in 2012, beyond those required the whole share count flat where we ended 2011. Acquisitions remain our top priority for use of our cash with a recent dividend initiation in commitment share repurchase reflecting our goal of maintaining a well-balanced capital deployment strategy. 
Our debt to cap is at a very reasonable level 25.2% at quarter end. We have an undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016, which combined with our free cash of $900 million provides capacitive $1.65 billion and significant financial flexibility as we evaluate perspective opportunity. 
So in conclusion, I'm encouraged to see significant progress being made across all of our businesses as we work towards our 2012 financial objectives and position the company for tomorrow. We have tripled our projected revenue growth rate from the prior year. And we've added more than $700,000 new members as compared to the prior year quarter. I'm personally focus on identifying the right investments for the future, pursuing growth opportunities across our portfolio businesses and improving our financial performance of existing businesses to strengthen the company to produce long-term value for our shareholders. Operator this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the lines for questions."

We knew that going from the dead start, cold start to manage the population was going to take some time. I think as we started to getting data in the first quarter, and I would characterize that as being late February, we became aware of the disproportionate membership in high-cost regions but high utilization on high-cost regions so in the late part of February, we became much more knowledgeable about what our problems beyond just managing the population was. When you go from a dead start, I think the lessons learned here is that I would be reluctant to participate in any new initiative that's pushed through a 90 to 120 days with only 60 days or so to prepare for the population. Those are lessons learned. But I think that the 50 initiatives that we have on the healthcare front, on the healthcare management front will -- are beginning and will begin to show some improvement, which is part of the reason for a guidance for the rest of the year. I think the number of providers that more date on who's more efficient as opposed to less efficient, we will be refining that process. That will bring improvement through the year. And ultimately, consistent with my prepared comments, I think that we will be successful in reaching an accommodation with the Commonwealth consistent with the contract that we signed.

So the company went through a period of time where we were sort of, not sort of, where we were holding in doing what we have but not very aggressive in pursuing new opportunities. When I came back to the CEO spot in January of 2009, I thought the world has changed a lot in 4 years, so we began developing resources and hopefully expertise and started putting corporate resources in the growing of business for the future. And Nebraska was the first bid that we won on that front and I won't go through the history. We have most recently within the last quarter brought Tim Nolan, whom I've known for 25 years on our business and who's in the very successful reinvigorating our Commonwealth of Pennsylvania business in this year's and along with Maryland and Delaware in the years in the past and so we have continually added people and added resources.

I think there's margin pressure on all of our businesses so you have to have best people and best business practices. So I think Kentucky was certainly an expensive education but we learning is we go, we've proven I think that we can compete for new business with everybody else.

Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first",2379,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first quarter of last year. And earnings per share of $1.20 driven by strength across 6 of our 7 businesses, especially our Medicare Advantage business. 
As you can see in our current Medicaid medical loss ratio, we have some serious work to do in our recently added Medicaid business, but all of Coventry's other businesses: Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and our Fee-based businesses were on track or ahead of plan for the quarter. With regard to SG&A, we posted a very strong result with the rate of 13.6%, which is down 280 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. 
Today, I'd like to touch on each of our businesses and share with you our current perspective and probably more importantly where we're heading. And let's start with Medicare. The strength of the quarter in terms of Medicare Advantage was primarily driven by 3 factors: a very successful open enrollment season, which resulted in sequential membership growth of 13% or 28,000 members; the second was a very favorable outcome from the risk adjustment data validation audit process pursuant to methodology changes issued by CMS during the quarter enabling us to reduce our related reserve that we've built over the last several years; and third, strong operating results in Medicare Advantage even absent the operating earnings driven by the RADV reserve release. 
I believe it's worth a moment staying on Medicare Advantage. We operate Medicare Advantage Health Plans in 15 states, 14 of these states growing coming into 2012. We're pleased with the momentum of this business and expect to continue to expand our footprint and membership base over the next few years. We have taken what we believed was a prudent posture over the last few years and accruing our best estimate of RADV liability even in the absent of perfect clarity. 
The update in guidance from CMS were able to reflect the reduction in the RADV reserve of $133 million or $0.58 per share contributing to the strong Medicare operating results in the quarter. This is important for a couple of reasons. First of all, it should give you insight into the prudence in reserving for this type of exposure, which I believe was not necessarily consistent industry wide. And perhaps more important, we were able to substantially reduce a headwind in our Medicare Advantage bids since we'll now adapt to the updated CMS RADV guidance. 
As we look ahead, this along with strong execution and performance of our Medicare business to continue to support the competitiveness of our Medicare Advantage products. 
Other Medicare business, Part D, also had a very good first quarter. Coventry has a national Part D footprint and is #5 nationwide in market share. As you may recall from the open enrollment period coming into 2012, we're able to expand our auto-assigned footprint from 15 to 23 regions and launched a third product with a preferred network creating attractive value proposition for seniors. And the results were very satisfying. We grew 28% sequentially in the first quarter 2012, adding 315,000 members. Our Part D medical loss ratio is consistent with prior year Q1 and on track for the first full year forecast of low to the mid-80s of medical loss ratios.
Our combined and Medicare business represents approximately $4.3 billion of annual revenue or about 30% of the company's total revenue. From our perspective, Medicare has an attractive growth and margin profile and we're off to an excellent start in 2012.
Moving on to our Fee-based businesses, Coventry's diversified across 3 business signs: Workers' Compensation service, federal employee administration and Rental Network. Our Fee businesses produced over $1.1 billion in free revenue with higher-margin characteristics than our Risk business. First quarter of 2012, was slightly ahead of our previous plan and as you can see, we increased our forecast of fee revenue for the full year. These Fee businesses are important part of our diversified portfolio and they generate strong earnings with unregulated cash flow. 
Moving onto our Commercial business. We continue to focus on building and signing new contracts for high performance networks, as I've covered last quarter. Regardless of the outcome of reform, we believe driving to a low-cost structure will best position Coventry, enable us to create products to provide a compelling value proposition for both employees, for both individuals and employer groups. We currently sell Group commercial products through our health plans in 25 states. We spent the last 6 years developing individual products and capabilities, and currently sell individual products alongside our historically strong Group products in all of those states. 
The gaining factor for Coventry entering a commercial market, either organically or through acquisition, is cost structure. Many cases a network components of cost structure is a key asset in an acquisition and often negotiated as a part of the transaction. In other cases, we're able to use a collective set of company assets including our locally-based health plans and other national businesses to maintain a top tier cost structure in existing markets and negotiate favorable cost structure in new markets. We expect our high performance networks to play an important part in both the existing and new markets. 
Ultimately, we look forward to seizing growth driven by the Health Care Reform jump ball, or quickly adapt if Health Care Reform course changes. 
Nimbleness and local marker intelligence through our Health Plan presence has historically been a key strength in our commercial Health Plan business for at least 15 years. We expect our efforts will position us for success regardless of the direction of Health Care Reform. 
I'm moving on to Medicaid. Our Medicaid business has experienced significant growth coming into 2012. We're currently in 10 states carrying members in program spanning temporary aid in needy families, age blind and disabled, bills and CHIP members. Coventry has helped states manage Medicaid populations and programs since the early days of state-based managed care adoption over 1.5 decade ago. Our Medicaid experience in solutions certainly contributed to Coventry's successful pre-procurement of Missouri, our largest state presence in terms of membership which was announced by the state of Missouri during the first quarter. In addition, we look forward to adding to our position in Nebraska later in 2012, based on the win discussed in our last conference call. 
We also today have some news to report on the Medicaid RFP front. This week, our Pennsylvania subsidiary Health America, was awarded 2 letters of intent to contract which will cover new managed care regions in Eastern and Western Pennsylvania. As you may recall, we already have a Medicaid footprint in South Eastern and Southwestern Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania selected 4 carriers in the West for a targeted effective date of September 1, 2012, to manage approximately 165,000 eligibles. 3 carriers were selected in the East including Health America for a targeted implementation date in Q1 2013 to manage approximately 215,000 eligibles. 
So as a result, we look forward to serving our share of the 380,000 members when these programs go live. 
Our mature Medicaid business performed consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. With respect to our new Medicaid businesses, as you will recall, close to Family Health Partners acquisition on January 1 of this year, which our results reflect the first few months of our ownership there. I'm pleased with our relationship with Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, key partner in providing quality care to children in Missouri and Kansas. As you would expect, this relationship was certainly an important element of the transaction. The integration of the acquired business is on track 3 months post closing and the successful procurement outcomes in Missouri was a very good start to this acquisition. 
Our remaining relatively new Medicaid business is Kentucky, which is for us producing very negative financial results. Actually we're getting our tails kicked. Kentucky is in early stages of a 36-month contract, which was effective November 1, 2011. Now that we have 5 months of data, it's clear that our poor financial results really result from 3 areas: 1 of which was anticipated and 2 of which were not. First area is a result of adverse risk selection. How did this happen? Well the RFP which we responded to and all other bidders responded to, required a robust list of contractor providers in all 7 regions in order to bid. If the response was inadequate in any one of the 7 regions, responding companies would've been eliminated for all regions. Coventry responded to this stringent standard and compiled in all regions, even though the provider cost and health status of the Commonwealth of Kentucky citizens is more challenging in regions 7 and 8. Not all companies selected responded in the matter that we did but were nevertheless allowed to participate in all regions. And the result is what you would expect, which is we received a disproportionate number of members with high utilization enrolled in high-cost systems. Our company also exacerbated our problem by being the only carrier not to require copayments in pharmacy.
In the RFP, the Commonwealth of Kentucky committed to an appropriate risk adjustment mechanism to adjust or partially adjust for adverse risk but at this time, we've been unable to obtain their commitment for compensation which would address the adverse risk selection as required by the contract that we have with them. As discussion is ongoing and while we cannot be specific as to the timing, we feel that these discussions will be successful. 
The second and unanticipated area was at least one error from the Commonwealth's data book when we bid the business with regard to pass-through payments to hospitals for medical education. This was clearly an oversight by the Commonwealth and while we have not been able to attain agreement from Kentucky at this time, on this front, we believe we will ultimately be successful and obtain adjustment for these hospital pass-through payments.
Third area is the basics of managed care, which was anticipated. How do we take better care of members in a more cost-effective manner? It was expected and we now have the data to address the basics of approved care for the members and the initiative necessary to control costs and improve care. These areas include pharmaceutical abuses, mental health issues, too many non-par providers and so many other areas. We are currently working on about 50 initiatives, which will deliver value to the Kentucky Medicaid program and improve outcomes for the members.
Bottom line, we're confident our discussions with the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our medical initiatives will make this a viable program for the future. Hopefully you've listened carefully to our discussion about Kentucky as we will not entertain any questions on this subject during the Q&A portion. We're obviously in ongoing discussions with the Commonwealth of Kentucky in many areas as well as many providers and it would be inappropriate to talk about details of these discussions in this forum. 
One more thought on Kentucky. It's important to reiterate that the population previously operated in a completely unmanaged arena. And I'm not only talking about the members but also physicians especially vendors, pharmacies and so on. I want to assure you that we put all the resources of the company to bear the work with the Commonwealth on appropriate solutions such as proper risk adjustment and fair and equal treatment on implementing the dozens of healthcare initiatives that should bring medical cost down perspectively. More resources in our company are focused on finding the proper long-term solution, make it financially sound and workable while improving the care for the members. But while we work on improvements in Kentucky, our other diversified businesses continue to perform well and we're seeking out an other selective growth opportunities across our broad set of businesses. 
Our balance sheet is in excellent condition as I referenced in the last earning call with the reduced level of debt. And we currently have $900 million of deployable cash on hand as of March 31, as well as an untapped credit facility of $750 million. At our regularly scheduled Board meeting in mid-March, we spent time on capital deployment avenues including M&A, share repurchase and for first time in the companies history our Board approved a dividend to complement these other methods of delivering value to our shareholders. Those of you who were shareholders as of March 23, should have received your first quarterly dividend on April 9. 
While the level of cash generated in our businesses and our capitalization, we believe we continue to deliver value to shareholders and M&A share repurchase while also providing for dividend that today analyzes to approximately $70 million. 
Recap our first quarter capital deployment activity we closed an acquisition, paid down $234 million of debt and declared our first shareholder dividend. We are planning to continue with the share repurchase program beginning in Q2 at level somewhere 2012, absent any compelling M&A opportunities or other usage. While we will evaluate and react each quarter to needs and opportunities, we are committed to a continuation of capital deployment. I'm really pleased with the positioning of our diversified set of businesses and the resulting opportunities that we should be able to seize over the next few years in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, bill eligibles and potential opportunities in the commercial market. 
In addition to the company's organic opportunities, we'll also selectively deploy capital to grow our business footprint. The benefit of having a set of well diversified businesses and a strong balance sheet, is a strength which allows us to invest in new opportunities and survive the challenges that new ventures often bring. While I'm disappointed in the early start to the Kentucky contract, we will continue to seek new Medicaid opportunities along with growing our other businesses to bring the long-term value necessary for owners. And with those comments, I'll conclude my part of the presentation and our Chief Financial Officer, Randy Giles, will take you through the financials. Randy?"
27133,204626278,292079,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings",2812,"Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.20, which includes the $0.58 benefit from the release of reserves related to RADV as Allen described in his prepared remarks and $0.62 of earnings generated by the company's operations excluding the RADV item. 
As you saw on this morning's earnings release, our full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $3.10 to $3.30 inclusive of favorable impact of the RADV reserve release as well as other updates that I will detail further in my commentary this morning.
It's important to note that this guidance range does not reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchases in 2012, beyond those required to hold share count flat was where we ended 2011. Our consolidated revenue guidance now exceeds $14 billion at the midpoint with the similar mix of business roughly 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% being other. As in our previous guidance, we're reflecting movement to a more balanced mix over 2011. This strategic diversification across a balanced portfolio of businesses gives us a flexibility to adapt to today's fluid regulatory environment and seize opportunities across the products spectrum.
The results for the first quarter of 2012, were characterized by performance meeting or exceeding our expectations in 6 out of our 7 core businesses, with an outstanding result on SG&A as our cost control efforts coupled with leveraging top line growth continue to bear fruit for the organization. Our Q1 revenue of $3.7 billion puts us ahead of our prior guidance range and drove the increase to our full year guidance midpoint $14.1 billion in revenue, which would be a record revenue level for the company reflecting a significant acceleration in the company's growth rate over 2011. 
Starting with the Commercial business. First quarter MLR of 79.9%, keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance range of 81% to 82%. This is consistent with the 81.6% result that we reported for full year 2011, which was the first year impacted by minimum MLR regulations. We are currently projecting total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion for the year, the individual business expected to generate approximately $425 million of that total. The remaining Group risk revenues are expected to be split roughly 40% small group and 60% large group, consistent with the mix that we saw in 2011. We currently estimate that approximately 25% of our Commercial Risk revenue is in a rebate position today. We will continue to evaluate strategies to effectively utilize rebate capital by providing more value to our customers; improving the attractiveness of our products; promoting quality initiatives with hospitals and physicians to improve HEDIS scores; and initiatives to reduce future Healthcare cost. 
Staying at our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In the rearview mirror, we are seeing trends in the high 7s and have continued to migrate higher from the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010 consistent with what we shared with you last quarter. Again these trends include the impact from the healthcare reform regulations implemented on September 23, 2010, which are fully incorporated into the current period but are only partially included in the baseline. 
Unit cost trend, which continues to be the largest driver of overall trend is stable. As we look at trend by component, in the first quarter we saw a slightly negative trend for inpatient days per thousand and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive prospectively, which is consistent with our prior prospective view given the historically low comparison levels that we're seeing during 2011. 
Utilization trends that we are seeing in the outpatient physician categories continues to show signs of a slight increase similar to what we observed over the last 2 quarters, both remaining in slightly positive territory. This migration from negative outpatient physician utilization trend to slightly positive, has been gradual and has been anticipated in our pricing. 
Before I leave the Commercial business, there's one other item that I would like to highlight this morning. In the first quarter, we signed a binding term sheet with Magellan's NIA subsidiary [indiscernible] expanding our strategic partnership, radiology management services. This term sheet renewed agreements that were set to expire in the near-term, restructured the overall terms of the agreement and significantly lowered our capitative medical cost for this category of service. 
Moving on to government programs. Our Medicare results for the first quarter were driven by outstanding performance during the annual election period which I'd like to highlight in a little more detail. Starting with Medicare Part D. We solidified our #5 [ph]  national market share with the third highest absolute growth in the industry and the second highest growth on a percentage basis among our large peers as our innovative new product First Health Value Plus enrolled approximately 375,000 members, increasing our total Part D membership to $1,158,000 at quarter end. We like our positioning for 2012 and expect to continue to grow Part D membership throughout the remainder of 2012. 
We're also pleased with enrollment results for our locally-contracted Medicare Advantage products as we added 28,000 new members, which was the third best percentage growth among our large competitors and included growth in all but 1 of our 15 states increasing total Medicare Advantage Membership to 250,000 members at quarter end.
Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 74.1% reported or 82.9% for the quarter, excluding the favorable impact from RADV reserve releases, was clearly a very strong start to the year consistent with our full year MLR guidance excluding RADV impact in the mid-to low 80s. These results were supported by mid-single digit reduction in days per thousand from the prior year quarter. Our Medicare part D results for the first quarter were also strong in terms of growth and our MLR of 94.9% keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance in the low to mid-80s. 
I will now discuss our Medicaid business in detail as we saw MLR pressure in the first quarter that I want to address and also talk about some of the initiatives that we're working on to improve these results throughout the remainder of 2012. First, let me remind you that we have Medicaid business in 10 states today with total Medicaid Membership of 924,000 at quarter end, which has increased by 97% from the prior year quarter as we work towards our goal of enrolling 1 million Medicaid members. 
With the exception of the ramp-up in Kentucky, our Medicaid business is performing well both in terms of organic membership growth and MLR performance. Allen already outlined some of the challenges that we are experiencing in Kentucky which I would like to now elaborate on. 
Our outdated guidance incorporates a projection for Medicaid MLR in the mid-90s for the full year, increased from our previous guidance of approximately 90% driven entirely by Kentucky. As we discussed in the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings call, the Commonwealth of Kentucky quickly transitioned a highly unmanaged Medicaid population to managed care beginning in November 2011. 
When Coventry bid on this business, there was always an underlying assumption that projected taking historically elevated to spending levels and through the implementation of traditional managed care  protocols an improvement of patient care reducing both excessive utilization and wasteful spending over time. This process has been more challenging than we had forecast, as our reported MLR in the first quarter 2012 of 120.9% was higher than what we recorded in fourth quarter of 2011. I would like to reiterate Allen's comment that we are very disappointed in this outcome, and have focused many of the company's most senior executives on addressing the situation. We have also strengthened management on the ground and continue to add significant resources. For reasons that I'm sure you understand I cannot get into specifics on the discussions that we're having with the Commonwealth, but let me broadly outline for you what we are doing both in terms of the revenue side as well as on medical cost initiatives. 
On the revenue side, we're in discussions with the Commonwealth around the appropriate mechanism for risk adjustment payments as stipulated in our contract. At this point, it also remains unclear whether these payments will be made retroactively to the contract inception date or whether they will be prospective only. 
We're also working to address certain data book errors, for example around supplemental payments which would more properly match our revenue with underlying cost structure dynamics of this contract. And finally, as we've disclosed previously, we have a 5.3% rate increase which will take effect on October 1 of this year. 
On the expense side, our management team and some of our top clinical professionals from other areas of the organization are fully engaged in implementing more than 50 real-time ongoing action items based upon emerging data to address higher cost areas. 
It is clear that pharmacy and behavioral health cost, in particular, are exceeding our previous projections. Now that we have a stable population based, we've been able to more effectively deploy our solutions for these specific pressure areas. 
As an example, the run rate of pharmacy costs should benefit from an ongoing increase in generic utilization, as well as 4 major branded drugs converting to generic during 2012. We've also developed initiatives to address areas which appear to have questionable prescribing patterns which is all part of turning an unmanaged program into managed care. 
We have similar initiatives covering network construction; provider profiling and collaboration efforts; fraud and abuse; an increased pre-authorization process; increasing member cost-sharing and so on. 
During the first quarter, the rules around transitional care from the unmanaged period ended. We are now able to implement processes to improve care coordination and manage cost. Also in the first quarter, the reimbursement level for non-par providers was reduced from 100% of the Kentucky Medicaid fee scheduled to 90%. 
We have an extensive list of other initiatives as well, covering all categories of healthcare expense. They are being worked on every day and evaluated by senior management. Though all these are not things that we can turn around immediately, we expect continued improvement during 2012, as we resolve matters with the Commonwealth and bring run rate  cost down based upon the initiatives outlined above. We're absolutely focused of rectifying this isolated situation. 
Before I conclude my Medicaid commentary, I would like to highlight the 75% of our membership which resides in states other than Kentucky that is performing well both in terms of financial results, in terms of seizing growth opportunities. In the last earnings call, we highlighted our contract award in Nebraska, where we will have the #1 market share and be the only participant with a statewide presence when that contract commences in the third quarter of this year. 
We also announced a new contract in Pennsylvania commencing during the second quarter as we were awarded entry into the Southwest region of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program, Health Choices. We began enrolling new members on April 1, and that region expect to gradually grow our market share there through auto assignment similar to our growing presence in the Southeast region. I'm excited to announce that on the heels of our launch in the Southwest region, we were just notified recently, as Allen mentioned, that we have been awarded significant new letters of intent to contract in both the New West and New East zones of Pennsylvania as well with total Medicaid eligibles of approximately 380,000. The New West contract is expected to commence in September with the New East contract beginning in March of 2013. They're not expected to have a material impact on our financial results for 2012. 
While our win in Missouri was not necessarily a new business, I'm very pleased that our Medicaid team was able to retain our #1 market position in that state including the recently acquired Family Health Partners business which represents our largest presence in terms of membership today. 
Now moving on to our Fee-based businesses. Our updated guidance incorporates an improved view of management services revenue driven by higher than expected revenue from our Workers' Compensation business as well as better volumes in Health Plan ASO. The increase in our guidance for the cost of sales line item reflects a portion of growth that we are seeing Worker's Compensation services. Our Fee businesses are an important part of our product portfolio strategy providing diversification from our large risk-based business with valuable unregulated cash flows and are an area that we intend to grow and invest in prospectively. 
Our SG&A results for the quarter and corresponding full year guidance reflect the continued progress that the company is making towards driving a low cost structure that we believe is the most critical component of Coventry's long-term strategy. 
For the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $502.9 million or 13.6% of revenue driven by careful management of headcount and other cost even as we continue to grow the top line revenue. In addition, we are seeing increased traction in our broker pass-through strategy, the Commercial Group business which has a beneficial impact on our SG&A expense levels. 
Our revised full year SG&A guidance midpoint of 14.9% of revenue is an improvement of 160 basis points from 2011. It is particularly satisfying when you consider the additional expense that we are incurring for compliance with new healthcare regulations, investments in our recently added businesses, as well as increasing investments that we're making for future growth. 
The full year guidance includes our normal assumption for an elevated level spend during the fourth quarter related to the Medicare AEP, as well as typical January 1 renewal expenses for the Commercial Risk business. 
As you saw on this morning's press release, our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $420.5 million or 246% of net income. These results include the receipt of an extra payment from CMS in the quarter as well as a positive adjustment related to the RADV reserve release. So after adjusting for these items, our cash flow from operations was $123 million or more typical 139% of net income. 
Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position for the first quarter with the net unrealized gain of $100 million at March 31, an increase from $97 million at the end of 2011. At the end of the quarter we had $900 million of deployable free cash that's apparent, consistent with the level that we disclosed in our prior earnings call which was as of January 31. 
As usual, during the second quarter we'll begin our annual regulated subsidiary dividend process. The first quarter was quite an eventful one on the capital deployment front. To begin, we closed the Family Health Partners acquisition early January, then we paid off our $234 million of senior notes that came due later in the month. Finally on March 12, the company announced our first dividend in its history which was subsequently paid on April 9. 
As Allen mentioned, we are also committed to point capital per share repurchase beginning in the second quarter and targeting levels comparable to 2011.  It's important to note that our EPS guidance range does not include anticipated share repurchases in 2012, beyond those required to hold share count flat where we ended 2011. Acquisitions remain our top priority for use of our cash with a recent dividend initiation in commitment share repurchase reflecting our goal of maintaining a well-balanced capital deployment strategy. 
Our debt to cap is at a very reasonable level 25.2% at quarter end. We have an undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016, which combined with our free cash of $900 million provides capacity of $1.65 billion and significant financial flexibility as we evaluate perspective opportunity. 
So in conclusion, I'm encouraged to see significant progress being made across all of our businesses as we work towards our 2012 financial objectives and position the company for tomorrow. We have tripled our projected revenue growth rate from the prior year. And we've added more than $700,000 new members as compared to the prior year quarter. I'm personally focus on identifying the right investments for the future, pursuing growth opportunities across our portfolio businesses, and improving the financial performance of existing businesses to strengthen the company to produce long-term value for our shareholders. Operator this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the lines for questions."

I think that as we started to getting data in the first quarter, and I would characterize that as being late February, we became aware of the disproportionate membership in high-cost regions -- both high utilization and high-cost regions -- so in the late part of February, we became much more knowledgeable about what our problems beyond just managing the population was. When you go from a dead start, I think the lessons learned here is that I would be reluctant to participate in any new initiative that's pushed through a 90 to 120 days with only 60 days or so to prepare for the population. Those are lessons learned. But I think that the 50 initiatives that we have on the healthcare front, on the healthcare management front will -- are beginning and will begin to show some improvement, which is part of the reason for a guidance for the rest of the year. I think the number of providers that have more data on who's more efficient as opposed to less efficient, we will be refining that process. That will bring improvement through the year. And ultimately, consistent with my prepared comments, I think that we will be successful in reaching an accommodation with the Commonwealth consistent with the contract that we signed.

In the early -- in the late '90s, we had some places that we withdrew from, Florida when rates were arbitrarily cut by a lot and the Delaware at one time. So the company went through a period of time where we were sort of, not sort of, where we were holding and doing what we have but not very aggressive in pursuing new opportunities. When I came back to the CEO spot in January of 2009, I thought the world had changed a lot in 4 years, so we began developing resources and hopefully expertise and started putting corporate resources in the growing of business for the future. And Nebraska was the first bid that we won on that front and I won't go through the history. We have most recently within the last quarter brought Tim Nolan, whom I've known for 25 years on our business and who's in the very successful reinvigorating our Commonwealth of Pennsylvania business in his years and along with Maryland and Delaware in the years in the past, and so we have continually added people and added resources. And so strategically, I think it's a good business. I think it's like all of our other businesses that you're going to have to get better that we used to be. I think there's margin pressure on all of our businesses so you have to have best people and best business practices. So I think Kentucky was certainly an expensive education but we're learning as we go. We've proven I think that we can compete for new business with everybody else. And I think on the government front with this Medicare Advantage Part D, I feel the same way about Medicaid that we have the structure, we have the better people than we've ever had. We are continuing to learn. We're continuing to do a better job taking care of the population. So it's a part of our future and in spite of a little blip along the way, or a big blip along the way, we're undaunted and we think that there's a lot of opportunity.

Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first",2378,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported the best quarter in the history of our company both in terms of revenue and earnings per share. Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion, and that's up 21% from the first quarter of last year. And earnings per share of $1.20 driven by strength across 6 of our 7 businesses, especially our Medicare Advantage business. 
As you can see in our current Medicaid medical loss ratio, we have some serious work to do in our recently added Medicaid business, but all of Coventry's other businesses: Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and our Fee-based businesses were on track or ahead of plan for the quarter. With regard to SG&A, we posted a very strong result with the rate of 13.6%, which is down 280 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. 
Today, I'd like to touch on each of our businesses and share with you our current perspective and probably more importantly where we're heading. And let's start with Medicare. The strength of the quarter in terms of Medicare Advantage was primarily driven by 3 factors: a very successful open enrollment season, which resulted in sequential membership growth of 13% or 28,000 members; the second was a very favorable outcome from the risk adjustment data validation audit process pursuant to methodology changes issued by CMS during the quarter enabling us to reduce our related reserve that we've built over the last several years; and third, strong operating results in Medicare Advantage even absent the operating earnings driven by the RADV reserve release. 
I believe it's worth a moment staying on Medicare Advantage. We operate Medicare Advantage Health Plans in 15 states, 14 of these states growing coming into 2012. We're pleased with the momentum of this business and expect to continue to expand our footprint and membership base over the next few years. We have taken what we believed was a prudent posture over the last few years and accruing our best estimate of RADV liability even in the absent of perfect clarity. 
The update in guidance from CMS were able to reflect the reduction in the RADV reserve of $133 million or $0.58 per share contributing to the strong Medicare operating results in the quarter. This is important for a couple of reasons. First of all, it should give you insight into the prudence in reserving for this type of exposure, which I believe was not necessarily consistent industry wide. And perhaps more important, we were able to substantially reduce a headwind in our Medicare Advantage bids since we'll now adapt to the updated CMS RADV guidance. 
As we look ahead, this along with strong execution and performance of our Medicare business to continue to support the competitiveness of our Medicare Advantage products. 
Other Medicare business, Part D, also had a very good first quarter. Coventry has a national Part D footprint and is #5 nationwide in market share. As you may recall from the open enrollment period coming into 2012, we're able to expand our auto-assigned footprint from 15 to 23 regions and launched a third product with a preferred network creating attractive value proposition for seniors. And the results were very satisfying. We grew 28% sequentially in the first quarter 2012, adding 315,000 members. Our Part D medical loss ratio is consistent with prior year Q1 and on track for the first full year forecast of low to the mid-80s of medical loss ratios.
Our combined and Medicare business represents approximately $4.3 billion of annual revenue or about 30% of the company's total revenue. From our perspective, Medicare has an attractive growth and margin profile and we're off to an excellent start in 2012.
Moving on to our Fee-based businesses, Coventry's diversified across 3 business signs: Workers' Compensation service, federal employee administration and Rental Network. Our Fee businesses produced over $1.1 billion in free revenue with higher-margin characteristics than our Risk business. First quarter of 2012, was slightly ahead of our previous plan and as you can see, we increased our forecast of fee revenue for the full year. These Fee businesses are important part of our diversified portfolio and they generate strong earnings with unregulated cash flow. 
Moving onto our Commercial business. We continue to focus on building and signing new contracts for high performance networks, as I've covered last quarter. Regardless of the outcome of reform, we believe driving to a low-cost structure will best position Coventry, enable us to create products to provide a compelling value proposition for both employees, for both individuals and employer groups. We currently sell Group commercial products through our health plans in 25 states. We spent the last 6 years developing individual products and capabilities, and currently sell individual products alongside our historically strong Group products in all of those states. 
The gaining factor for Coventry entering a commercial market, either organically or through acquisition, is cost structure. Many cases a network components of cost structure is a key asset in an acquisition and often negotiated as a part of the transaction. In other cases, we're able to use a collective set of company assets including our locally-based health plans and other national businesses to maintain a top tier cost structure in existing markets and negotiate favorable cost structure in new markets. We expect our high performance networks to play an important part in both the existing and new markets. 
Ultimately, we look forward to seizing growth driven by the Health Care Reform jump ball, or quickly adapt if Health Care Reform course changes. 
Nimbleness and local marker intelligence through our Health Plan presence has historically been a key strength in our commercial Health Plan business for at least 15 years. We expect our efforts will position us for success regardless of the direction of Health Care Reform. 
I'm moving on to Medicaid. Our Medicaid business has experienced significant growth coming into 2012. We're currently in 10 states carrying members in program spanning temporary aid in needy families, age blind and disabled, bills and CHIP members. Coventry has helped states manage Medicaid populations and programs since the early days of state-based managed care adoption over 1.5 decades ago. Our Medicaid experience in solutions certainly contributed to Coventry's successful pre-procurement of Missouri, our largest state presence in terms of membership which was announced by the state of Missouri during the first quarter. In addition, we look forward to adding to our position in Nebraska later in 2012, based on the win discussed in our last conference call. 
We also today have some news to report on the Medicaid RFP front. This week, our Pennsylvania subsidiary Health America, was awarded 2 letters of intent to contract which will cover new managed care regions in Eastern and Western Pennsylvania. As you may recall, we already have a Medicaid footprint in South Eastern and Southwestern Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania selected 4 carriers in the West for a targeted effective date of September 1, 2012, to manage approximately 165,000 eligibles. Three carriers were selected in the East including Health America for a targeted implementation date in Q1 2013 to manage approximately 215,000 eligibles. 
So as a result, we look forward to serving our share of the 380,000 members when these programs go live. 
Our mature Medicaid business performed consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. With respect to our new Medicaid businesses, as you will recall, close to Family Health Partners acquisition on January 1 of this year, which our results reflect the first few months of our ownership there. I'm pleased with our relationship with Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, key partner in providing quality care to children in Missouri and Kansas. As you would expect, this relationship was certainly an important element of the transaction. The integration of the acquired business is on track 3 months post closing and the successful procurement outcomes in Missouri was a very good start to this acquisition. 
Our remaining relatively new Medicaid business is Kentucky, which is for us producing very negative financial results. Actually we're getting our tails kicked. Kentucky is in early stages of a 36-month contract, which was effective November 1, 2011. Now that we have 5 months of data, it's clear that our poor financial results really result from 3 areas: 1 of which was anticipated and 2 of which were not. First area is a result of adverse risk selection. How did this happen? Well the RFP which we responded to and all other bidders responded to, required a robust list of contractor providers in all 7 regions in order to bid. If the response was inadequate in any one of the 7 regions, responding companies would've been eliminated for all regions. Coventry responded to this stringent standard and compiled in all regions, even though the provider cost and health status of the Commonwealth of Kentucky citizens is more challenging in regions 7 and 8. Not all companies selected responded in the matter that we did but were nevertheless allowed to participate in all regions. And the result is what you would expect, which is we received a disproportionate number of members with high utilization enrolled in high-cost systems. Our company also exacerbated our problem by being the only carrier not to require copayments in pharmacy.
In the RFP, the Commonwealth of Kentucky committed to an appropriate risk adjustment mechanism to adjust or partially adjust for adverse risk but at this time, we've been unable to obtain their commitment for compensation which would address the adverse risk selection as required by the contract that we have with them. As discussion is ongoing and while we cannot be specific as to the timing, we feel that these discussions will be successful. 
The second and unanticipated area was at least one error from the Commonwealth's data book when we bid the business with regard to pass-through payments to hospitals for medical education. This was clearly an oversight by the Commonwealth and while we have not been able to attain agreement from Kentucky at this time, on this front, we believe we will ultimately be successful and obtain adjustment for these hospital pass-through payments.
Third area is the basics of managed care, which was anticipated. How do we take better care of members in a more cost-effective manner? It was expected and we now have the data to address the basics of approved care for the members and the initiative necessary to control costs and improve care. These areas include pharmaceutical abuses, mental health issues, too many non-par providers and so many other areas. We are currently working on about 50 initiatives, which will deliver value to the Kentucky Medicaid program and improve outcomes for the members.
Bottom line, we're confident our discussions with the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our medical initiatives will make this a viable program for the future. Hopefully you've listened carefully to our discussion about Kentucky as we will not entertain any questions on this subject during the Q&A portion. We're obviously in ongoing discussions with the Commonwealth of Kentucky in many areas as well as many providers and it would be inappropriate to talk about details of these discussions in this forum. 
One more thought on Kentucky. It's important to reiterate that the population previously operated in a completely unmanaged arena. And I'm not only talking about the members but also physicians especially vendors, pharmacies and so on. I want to assure you that we put all the resources of the company to bear the work with the Commonwealth on appropriate solutions such as proper risk adjustment and fair and equal treatment on implementing the dozens of healthcare initiatives that should bring medical cost down perspectively. More resources in our company are focused on finding the proper long-term solution, make it financially sound and workable while improving the care for the members. But while we work on improvements in Kentucky, our other diversified businesses continue to perform well and we're seeking out another selective growth opportunities across our broad set of businesses. 
Our balance sheet is in excellent condition as I referenced in the last earning call with the reduced level of debt. And we currently have $900 million of deployable cash on hand as of March 31, as well as an untapped credit facility of $750 million. At our regularly scheduled board meeting in mid-March, we spent time on capital deployment avenues including M&A, share repurchase and for first time in the company’s history, our board approved a dividend to complement these other methods of delivering value to our shareholders. Those of you who were shareholders as of March 23, should have received your first quarterly dividend on April 9. 
While the level of cash generated in our businesses and our capitalization, we believe we continue to deliver value to shareholders and M&A share repurchase while also providing for dividend that today analyzes to approximately $70 million. 
Recap our first quarter capital deployment activity we closed an acquisition, paid down $234 million of debt and declared our first shareholder dividend. We are planning to continue with the share repurchase program beginning in Q2 at level somewhere 2012, absent any compelling M&A opportunities or other usage. While we will evaluate and react each quarter to needs and opportunities, we are committed to a continuation of capital deployment. I'm really pleased with the positioning of our diversified set of businesses and the resulting opportunities that we should be able to seize over the next few years in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, bill eligibles and potential opportunities in the commercial market. 
In addition to the company's organic opportunities, we'll also selectively deploy capital to grow our business footprint. The benefit of having a set of well diversified businesses and a strong balance sheet, is a strength which allows us to invest in new opportunities and survive the challenges that new ventures often bring. While I'm disappointed in the early start to the Kentucky contract, we will continue to seek new Medicaid opportunities along with growing our other businesses to bring the long-term value necessary for owners. And with those comments, I'll conclude my part of the presentation and our Chief Financial Officer, Randy Giles, will take you through the financials. Randy?"
27133,204626278,292110,"Coventry Health Care Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2012",2012-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Coventry Health Care, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings",2812,"Thank you, Allen. This morning I want to begin by discussing our consolidated performance in the first quarter and then spend the remainder of my time reviewing our first quarter results and full year outlook for each of our key businesses. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.20, which includes the $0.58 benefit from the release of reserves related to RADV as Allen described in his prepared remarks and $0.62 of earnings generated by the company's operations excluding the RADV item. 
As you saw on this morning's earnings release, our full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $3.10 to $3.30 inclusive of favorable impact of the RADV reserve release as well as other updates that I will detail further in my commentary this morning.
It's important to note that this guidance range does not reflect the impact of anticipated share repurchases in 2012, beyond those required to hold share count flat was where we ended 2011. Our consolidated revenue guidance now exceeds $14 billion at the midpoint with the similar mix of business roughly 40% commercial, 30% Medicare, 20% Medicaid and just under 10% being other. As in our previous guidance, we're reflecting movement to a more balanced mix over 2011. This strategic diversification across a balanced portfolio of businesses gives us a flexibility to adapt to today's fluid regulatory environment and seize opportunities across the products spectrum.
The results for the first quarter of 2012, were characterized by performance meeting or exceeding our expectations in 6 out of our 7 core businesses, with an outstanding result on SG&A as our cost control efforts coupled with leveraging top line growth continue to bear fruit for the organization. Our Q1 revenue of $3.7 billion puts us ahead of our prior guidance range and drove the increase to our full year guidance midpoint $14.1 billion in revenue, which would be a record revenue level for the company reflecting a significant acceleration in the company's growth rate over 2011. 
Starting with the Commercial business. First quarter MLR of 79.9%, keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance range of 81% to 82%. This is consistent with the 81.6% result that we reported for full year 2011, which was the first year impacted by minimum MLR regulations. We are currently projecting total Commercial Risk revenues of just under $6 billion for the year, the individual business expected to generate approximately $425 million of that total. The remaining Group risk revenues are expected to be split roughly 40% small group and 60% large group, consistent with the mix that we saw in 2011. We currently estimate that approximately 25% of our Commercial Risk revenue is in a rebate position today. We will continue to evaluate strategies to effectively utilize rebate capital by providing more value to our customers; improving the attractiveness of our products; promoting quality initiatives with hospitals and physicians to improve HEDIS scores; and initiatives to reduce future Healthcare cost. 
Staying at our commercial book, our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In the rearview mirror, we are seeing trends in the high 7s and have continued to migrate higher from the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010 consistent with what we shared with you last quarter. Again these trends include the impact from the healthcare reform regulations implemented on September 23, 2010, which are fully incorporated into the current period but are only partially included in the baseline. 
Unit cost trend, which continues to be the largest driver of overall trend is stable. As we look at trend by component, in the first quarter we saw a slightly negative trend for inpatient days per thousand and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive prospectively, which is consistent with our prior prospective view given the historically low comparison levels that we're seeing during 2011. 
Utilization trends that we are seeing in the outpatient physician categories continues to show signs of a slight increase similar to what we observed over the last 2 quarters, both remaining in slightly positive territory. This migration from negative outpatient physician utilization trend to slightly positive, has been gradual and has been anticipated in our pricing. 
Before I leave the Commercial business, there's one other item that I would like to highlight this morning. In the first quarter, we signed a binding term sheet with Magellan's NIA subsidiary [indiscernible] expanding our strategic partnership, radiology management services. This term sheet renewed agreements that were set to expire in the near-term, restructured the overall terms of the agreement and significantly lowered our capitative medical cost for this category of service. 
Moving on to government programs. Our Medicare results for the first quarter were driven by outstanding performance during the annual election period which I'd like to highlight in a little more detail. Starting with Medicare Part D. We solidified our #5 [ph]  national market share with the third highest absolute growth in the industry and the second highest growth on a percentage basis among our large peers as our innovative new product First Health Value Plus enrolled approximately 375,000 members, increasing our total Part D membership to $1,158,000 at quarter end. We like our positioning for 2012 and expect to continue to grow Part D membership throughout the remainder of 2012. 
We're also pleased with enrollment results for our locally-contracted Medicare Advantage products as we added 28,000 new members, which was the third best percentage growth among our large competitors and included growth in all but 1 of our 15 states increasing total Medicare Advantage Membership to 250,000 members at quarter end.
Our Medicare Advantage MLR of 74.1% reported or 82.9% for the quarter, excluding the favorable impact from RADV reserve releases, was clearly a very strong start to the year consistent with our full year MLR guidance excluding RADV impact in the mid-to low 80s. These results were supported by mid-single digit reduction in days per thousand from the prior year quarter. Our Medicare part D results for the first quarter were also strong in terms of growth and our MLR of 94.9% keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance in the low to mid-80s. 
I will now discuss our Medicaid business in detail as we saw MLR pressure in the first quarter that I want to address and also talk about some of the initiatives that we're working on to improve these results throughout the remainder of 2012. First, let me remind you that we have Medicaid business in 10 states today with total Medicaid Membership of 924,000 at quarter end, which has increased by 97% from the prior year quarter as we work towards our goal of enrolling 1 million Medicaid members. 
With the exception of the ramp-up in Kentucky, our Medicaid business is performing well both in terms of organic membership growth and MLR performance. Allen already outlined some of the challenges that we are experiencing in Kentucky which I would like to now elaborate on. 
Our outdated guidance incorporates a projection for Medicaid MLR in the mid-90s for the full year, increased from our previous guidance of approximately 90% driven entirely by Kentucky. As we discussed in the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings call, the Commonwealth of Kentucky quickly transitioned a highly unmanaged Medicaid population to managed care beginning in November 2011. 
When Coventry bid on this business, there was always an underlying assumption that projected taking historically elevated to spending levels and through the implementation of traditional managed care  protocols an improvement of patient care reducing both excessive utilization and wasteful spending over time. This process has been more challenging than we had forecast, as our reported MLR in the first quarter 2012 of 120.9% was higher than what we recorded in fourth quarter of 2011. I would like to reiterate Allen's comment that we are very disappointed in this outcome, and have focused many of the company's most senior executives on addressing the situation. We have also strengthened management on the ground and continue to add significant resources. For reasons that I'm sure you understand I cannot get into specifics on the discussions that we're having with the Commonwealth, but let me broadly outline for you what we are doing both in terms of the revenue side as well as on medical cost initiatives. 
On the revenue side, we're in discussions with the Commonwealth around the appropriate mechanism for risk adjustment payments as stipulated in our contract. At this point, it also remains unclear whether these payments will be made retroactively to the contract inception date or whether they will be prospective only. 
We're also working to address certain data book errors, for example around supplemental payments which would more properly match our revenue with underlying cost structure dynamics of this contract. And finally, as we've disclosed previously, we have a 5.3% rate increase which will take effect on October 1 of this year. 
On the expense side, our management team and some of our top clinical professionals from other areas of the organization are fully engaged in implementing more than 50 real-time ongoing action items based upon emerging data to address higher cost areas. 
It is clear that pharmacy and behavioral health cost, in particular, are exceeding our previous projections. Now that we have a stable population based, we've been able to more effectively deploy our solutions for these specific pressure areas. 
As an example, the run rate of pharmacy costs should benefit from an ongoing increase in generic utilization, as well as 4 major branded drugs converting to generic during 2012. We've also developed initiatives to address areas which appear to have questionable prescribing patterns which is all part of turning an unmanaged program into managed care. 
We have similar initiatives covering network construction; provider profiling and collaboration efforts; fraud and abuse; an increased pre-authorization process; increasing member cost-sharing and so on. 
During the first quarter, the rules around transitional care from the unmanaged period ended. We are now able to implement processes to improve care coordination and manage cost. Also in the first quarter, the reimbursement level for non-par providers was reduced from 100% of the Kentucky Medicaid fee scheduled to 90%. 
We have an extensive list of other initiatives as well, covering all categories of healthcare expense. They are being worked on every day and evaluated by senior management. Though all these are not things that we can turn around immediately, we expect continued improvement during 2012, as we resolve matters with the Commonwealth and bring run rate  cost down based upon the initiatives outlined above. We're absolutely focused of rectifying this isolated situation. 
Before I conclude my Medicaid commentary, I would like to highlight the 75% of our membership which resides in states other than Kentucky that is performing well both in terms of financial results, in terms of seizing growth opportunities. In the last earnings call, we highlighted our contract award in Nebraska, where we will have the #1 market share and be the only participant with a statewide presence when that contract commences in the third quarter of this year. 
We also announced a new contract in Pennsylvania commencing during the second quarter as we were awarded entry into the Southwest region of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program, Health Choices. We began enrolling new members on April 1, and that region expect to gradually grow our market share there through auto assignment similar to our growing presence in the Southeast region. I'm excited to announce that on the heels of our launch in the Southwest region, we were just notified recently, as Allen mentioned, that we have been awarded significant new letters of intent to contract in both the New West and New East zones of Pennsylvania as well with total Medicaid eligibles of approximately 380,000. The New West contract is expected to commence in September with the New East contract beginning in March of 2013. They're not expected to have a material impact on our financial results for 2012. 
While our win in Missouri was not necessarily a new business, I'm very pleased that our Medicaid team was able to retain our #1 market position in that state including the recently acquired Family Health Partners business which represents our largest presence in terms of membership today. 
Now moving on to our Fee-based businesses. Our updated guidance incorporates an improved view of management services revenue driven by higher than expected revenue from our Workers' Compensation business as well as better volumes in Health Plan ASO. The increase in our guidance for the cost of sales line item reflects a portion of growth that we are seeing Worker's Compensation services. Our Fee businesses are an important part of our product portfolio strategy providing diversification from our large risk-based business with valuable unregulated cash flows and are an area that we intend to grow and invest in prospectively. 
Our SG&A results for the quarter and corresponding full year guidance reflect the continued progress that the company is making towards driving a low cost structure that we believe is the most critical component of Coventry's long-term strategy. 
For the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $502.9 million or 13.6% of revenue driven by careful management of headcount and other cost even as we continue to grow the top line revenue. In addition, we are seeing increased traction in our broker pass-through strategy, the Commercial Group business which has a beneficial impact on our SG&A expense levels. 
Our revised full year SG&A guidance midpoint of 14.9% of revenue is an improvement of 160 basis points from 2011. It is particularly satisfying when you consider the additional expense that we are incurring for compliance with new healthcare regulations, investments in our recently added businesses, as well as increasing investments that we're making for future growth. 
The full year guidance includes our normal assumption for an elevated level spend during the fourth quarter related to the Medicare AEP, as well as typical January 1 renewal expenses for the Commercial Risk business. 
As you saw on this morning's press release, our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $420.5 million or 246% of net income. These results include the receipt of an extra payment from CMS in the quarter as well as a positive adjustment related to the RADV reserve release. So after adjusting for these items, our cash flow from operations was $123 million or more typical 139% of net income. 
Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our investment portfolio remained in a high-quality position for the first quarter with the net unrealized gain of $100 million at March 31, an increase from $97 million at the end of 2011. At the end of the quarter we had $900 million of deployable free cash that's apparent, consistent with the level that we disclosed in our prior earnings call which was as of January 31. 
As usual, during the second quarter we'll begin our annual regulated subsidiary dividend process. The first quarter was quite an eventful one on the capital deployment front. To begin, we closed the Family Health Partners acquisition early January, then we paid off our $234 million of senior notes that came due later in the month. Finally on March 12, the company announced our first dividend in its history which was subsequently paid on April 9. 
As Allen mentioned, we are also committed to point capital per share repurchase beginning in the second quarter and targeting levels comparable to 2011.  It's important to note that our EPS guidance range does not include anticipated share repurchases in 2012, beyond those required to hold share count flat where we ended 2011. Acquisitions remain our top priority for use of our cash with a recent dividend initiation in commitment share repurchase reflecting our goal of maintaining a well-balanced capital deployment strategy. 
Our debt to cap is at a very reasonable level 25.2% at quarter end. We have an undrawn $750 million credit facility that isn't scheduled to expire until 2016, which combined with our free cash of $900 million provides capacity of $1.65 billion and significant financial flexibility as we evaluate perspective opportunity. 
So in conclusion, I'm encouraged to see significant progress being made across all of our businesses as we work towards our 2012 financial objectives and position the company for tomorrow. We have tripled our projected revenue growth rate from the prior year. And we've added more than $700,000 new members as compared to the prior year quarter. I'm personally focus on identifying the right investments for the future, pursuing growth opportunities across our portfolio businesses, and improving the financial performance of existing businesses to strengthen the company to produce long-term value for our shareholders. Operator this now concludes our prepared remarks, and we are ready to open the lines for questions."

I think that as we started to getting data in the first quarter, and I would characterize that as being late February, we became aware of the disproportionate membership in high-cost regions -- both high utilization and high-cost regions -- so in the late part of February, we became much more knowledgeable about what our problems beyond just managing the population was. When you go from a dead start, I think the lessons learned here is that I would be reluctant to participate in any new initiative that's pushed through a 90 to 120 days with only 60 days or so to prepare for the population. Those are lessons learned. But I think that the 50 initiatives that we have on the healthcare front, on the healthcare management front will -- are beginning and will begin to show some improvement, which is part of the reason for a guidance for the rest of the year. I think the number of providers that have more data on who's more efficient as opposed to less efficient, we will be refining that process. That will bring improvement through the year. And ultimately, consistent with my prepared comments, I think that we will be successful in reaching an accommodation with the Commonwealth consistent with the contract that we signed.

So the company went through a period of time where we were sort of, not sort of, where we were holding and doing what we have but not very aggressive in pursuing new opportunities. When I came back to the CEO spot in January of 2009, I thought the world had changed a lot in 4 years, so we began developing resources and hopefully expertise and started putting corporate resources in the growing of business for the future. And Nebraska was the first bid that we won on that front and I won't go through the history. We have most recently within the last quarter brought Tim Nolan, whom I've known for 25 years on our business and who's in the very successful reinvigorating our Commonwealth of Pennsylvania business in his years and along with Maryland and Delaware in the years in the past, and so we have continually added people and added resources. And so strategically, I think it's a good business. I think it's like all of our other businesses that you're going to have to get better that we used to be. I think there's margin pressure on all of our businesses so you have to have best people and best business practices. So I think Kentucky was certainly an expensive education but we're learning as we go. We've proven I think that we can compete for new business with everybody else. And I think on the government front with this Medicare Advantage Part D, I feel the same way about Medicaid that we have the structure, we have the better people than we've ever had. We are continuing to learn. We're continuing to do a better job taking care of the population.

Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.65 for the quarter bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.85. The quarter was marked by significant improvement in Medicaid",1866,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.65 for the quarter bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.85. The quarter was marked by significant improvement in Medicaid performance, sequential growth in Medicare products, continued SG&A leverage and cash deployment for share repurchase. We are on track for our 2012 EPS forecast of $3.10, to $3.30 per share and therefore, are again reiterating full year 2012 guidance. 
I'll cover some of our business highlights and perhaps, more importantly, where we feel we're headed for tomorrow. Let's start with government programs, which now represents about 1/2 of the company's revenue. You may recall from the first quarter that our Medicare Advantage business, spanning 15 states had an excellent annual enrollment period with 13% sequential membership growth in the first quarter of 2012. Since Q1, we've continued to add membership each month in our Medicare Advantage business and we're at 253,000 members at the end of the second quarter. We are well-positioned in our Health Plan footprint from a cost structure, distribution and product standpoint and as such, expect to continue the growth and strong performance as we look multiple years ahead. During Q2, we our bids for 2013 and we're optimistic about the future serving the senior population. The story is similar for Medicare Part D. We experienced significant growth in Q1, followed by continued growth in each month of the second quarter. In fact, Medicare Part D grew by 36,000 members in Q2, averaging growth of about 12,000 members per month. We expect to continue growing throughout 2012 based on our positioning of our value cost product and the attractive value proposition we've been able to create for the senior population. To round up Medicare, the margins on these products continue to be on track with our forecast and consistent with prior year's. In Medicaid, coming into 2012, we experienced substantial growth effectively doubling our revenue to about $2.9 billion, led by the 2011 Kentucky win, the FHP acquisition and our granite wins in both Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Our challenge is to manage that growth and demonstrate that we're able to improve and manage bottom-line performance. Continuing the bottom-line performance thought, I'd like to continue the Medicaid discussion with a much more in-depth review of Kentucky. You may remember during Q1 conference call when I advised you that after 5 months of data it was obvious to us that we have severe earnings pressure and other challenges with regard to our 32-month contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky with approximately 230,000 members. At that time, I identified some of our major problems in the areas of adverse risk selection, especially in regions 7 and 8, lack of compensation from the Commonwealth for past due payments to hospitals due to errors or omissions in the data book and a challenge of managing the health and care of a very large population with limited preparation time. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that there's not been a managed care program in Kentucky previously and the fact that there wasn't permanent leadership in the Cabinet for health and family services in the early days of the program. Our challenges were made even more difficult due to litigation due to litigation from 1 of our largest providers group in region 8 that prevent us from exercising the 30-day notice of termination provision, even though our agreement clearly allowed us to do so, almost a perfect storm. Well enough history and I'm pleased to report that we're making very significant progress in many, if not most of the areas, which created a very poor financial result during the first 5 months of the contract. First, there's now permanent leadership at the Cabinet level for health and family services, which is resolved in the necessary and meaningful dialogue to develop a program that works for both Coventry and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Second, we received a partial adjustment regarding risk-adjusted revenue, which we were contractually owed. And this revenue produced perspective relief beginning April 1, 2012. Third, we received an adjustment of pass-through for hospital payments effective on May 1, 2012 that is retrospective back to November 1 of 2011. Accordingly, it reimburses to Health Plan for these past due costs for the entire contract period. In the area of patient management, I'd advised you on the last conference call the way that we'd identified 50 initiatives to take better care of the members and we have made, and we'll continue to make, very significant progress in this area. Commonwealth of Kentucky is a DRG state and we've been able to reduce costs and very numerous one-day admissions, which in many cases, we're replaced with observation periods, as is the practice in most hospitals throughout the country. You may also recall that we bid the business with a significant rate increase in year 2. In October of this year, we'll received a rate increase between 5.3% and 7%. The difference between the 5.3% and the 7% is that while we don't have a final, final agreement, we should receive additional risk-adjusted revenue beginning October 1 in addition to the agreed-upon 5.3% rate increase. And while we received a partial increase prospectively for this risk adjusted revenue, and resolve the hospital pass-through issue, we have not received reimbursement retrospectively for risk-adjusted revenue, which are we strongly feel is due. We filed an appeal to address this issue and if that fails, we'll litigate the issue. Kind of final thoughts on Kentucky and even though we were delayed by provider litigation, we will be able to move forward with terminating providers that do not meet our utilization and quality criteria so that we can continue to develop a more efficient delivery system as the year progresses. My personal belief is in the worst case, that Kentucky will be breakeven in 2013 and I feel that the more likely outcome is that we will have a reasonable profit on this business for 2013. 
In other Medicaid news, we're off to a great start in Nebraska out with our expansion on track from a recent RFP commenced on July 1st of June and we've enrolled more than 1/2 of the available membership, adding approximately 40,000 members resulting in a #1 statewide market position. We serve Nebraskans in Medicaid since 2010. We've had a Health Plan presence in Nebraska since 1998. We also look forward to 3 new Pennsylvania regions, which are being rolled out in a staggered fashion over the next 3 quarters starting with the Southwest in Q3, followed by the new West and ending with the new East in Q1 of 2013. And we'll continue to pursue these new opportunities where we believe we can bring our suit of capabilities to serve state and government program populations. One final Medicaid topic, which is Kansas. Based on the state's proposed terms for the new 2013 Medicaid contract and our corresponding bid posture, we did not win the state of Kansas Medicaid contract effective January 1, 2013. You may recall that FHP, which we acquired in January of 2012 operated in both Missouri and Kansas. We won the Missouri rebid earlier in the year, which is where most of the performance and value of this FHP resided and accordingly with the loss of the Kansas contract, we wrote off $7.7 million intangible in the quarter. Effective July 1, we did extend the existing Kansas contract for the remainder of 2012 and we believe is an appropriate rate increase. While suffice it is to say, we learned some lessons in Kentucky and although disappointed with the outcome and Kansas, we will not sacrifice operational or financial prudence in the search for just growth. We feel good about the growth dynamics included in the federal poverty level expansion in Medicaid and the dual eligible migration to managed care and we look forward to seizing our fair share, which should be significant opportunities over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Moving onto a few comments on the commercial business. We feel that we're well-positioned for the future from a cost structure standpoint and our local Health Plan footprint and we look forward to significant opportunities in 2014. For the past decade, we have certainly experienced from normal challenges and opportunity in the commercial book but 1 thing has been constant, our cost structure, which has been sound and the commercial business has always been profitable. The earnings and cash flow from the commercial business has enabled us to invest in M&A, as well as organic opportunities in government programs. And while the commercial business represents about 40% of Coventry's revenue today, we are targeting a portfolio with a balanced spread across Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial with our Fee business being a complementary part of a diversified revenue earnings and cash flow stream. I don't really have any new news on the Commercial environment, which is a bit challenging as there are many carriers seeking membership and what I feel is best stable pool of business and more likely today a diminishing pool. Despite the discussions and speculations about healthcare reform over the past year, we really never altered our focus in terms of preparing for the opportunities in 2014 and beyond. While the efforts to position Coventry for 2014 is the high performance network model of teaming up with leading health systems and physician groups and together, we expect to deliver a superior value proposition to commercial and Medicare members in terms of care coordination, quality, access and cost. We expect the commercial individual market to expand dramatically over the next few years. And we feel we'll be well-positioned to see that growth opportunity as well. In the area of capital activity, we deployed $300 million of cash on share repurchase in the second quarter, which represents about 6.5% of the outstanding shares and since Q2 is a quarter, when we received most of our regulated dividends, our deployable cash balance really didn't change significantly as we ended the second quarter with approximately $850 million of deployable cash on hand. 
So in summary, I'm very pleased with the positioning of our diversified business model as we look to the future. Given our exposure to and capabilities in Government Programs, we will continue to participate in growth opportunities in Medicaid expansion, Medicare and new eligibles. We also expect our Health Plan cost structure in many markets to be a winner in the 2014 commercial exchange jump ball. As usual, we take nothing for granted and we work everyday on cost structure and product positioning. We're committed to continuing to improvements in Kentucky. And we'll continue to use a strong balance sheet when appropriate in attracting for capital deployment. On balance, we feel very positive about the diversity of our products and our balance sheet. We've never been stronger. We're better positioned to continue positive growth in Medicare Advantage and Part D. I've feel we are positioned by resources, focus, commitment and experience to make substantial new Medicaid gains in the future. 
Those general comments. I'd like for Randy Giles, our CFO, to provide some financial details. Randy?"

This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.65, which includes a $0.03 impairment charge resulting from the nonrenewal of our Medicare contract with the state of Kansas. This result allows us to reaffirm our 2012 full year EPS gui",2043,"Thank you, Allen. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.65, which includes a $0.03 impairment charge resulting from the nonrenewal of our Medicare contract with the state of Kansas. This result allows us to reaffirm our 2012 full year EPS guidance range of $3.10, to $3.30 per share. I am pleased with the results that we reported today with reflect improved performance in our Medicaid business, sequential growth in our Medicare products continued SG&A efficiency and effective use of deployable capital. Our mix of business continues to shift towards more balanced levels across Commercial Risk, Medicare and Medicaid products with an important level of non-risk revenue provided by our fee-based businesses. We believe that a diversified portfolio of businesses provides a critical ability to both seize growth opportunities and provides the best positioning for continued growth and profitability. 
Let's begin with our government programs businesses, where I'm pleased to report significant improvement in Medicaid during the second quarter. Medicaid MLR of 93.3% is a 670 basis points sequential improvement was driven primarily by the significant improvement in Kentucky during the quarter. Excluding the impact of Kentucky our consolidated Q2 Medicaid MLR was an outstanding result, at 83.5% or a decrease of 340 basis points over the prior-year period. Our Kentucky Medicaid business improved from 120.9% MLR that we reported in Q1to 110.8% for the second quarter. A sequential improvement of 1,010 basis points, which was driven by favorable trends for both revenue and expense during the quarter. On the revenue front, during the quarter, we received more clarity from the Commonwealth regarding risk-adjusted payments owed to Coventry while we continue to discuss the underlying methodology of the risk-adjustment calculation with the Commonwealth, Coventry begin recognizing the positive revenue impact of a monthly risk-adjusted payment with an 8% quarter during the second quarter. As we disclosed during the investor conference during June, a supplemental payment issue has been resolved favorably, which had a positive impact on revenues in the second quarter, and will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, we'll be receiving a 5.3% contract rate increase on October 1, which will provide $4 million of incremental revenue from them [ph]  Plus any amount that result from continued discussions on risk adjustment as Allen mentioned. In terms of medical expense, we continue to make progress with our risk of targeted cost initiatives and expect the fruits of our labor to resolve in continued cost improvement during the second half of 2012 that throughout the remainder of the contract. We're in continued discussions with the Commonwealth regarding various aspects of the Medicaid program that we will continue to update you on as they develop. We remain on track to exit 2012 with the results such that Kentucky Medicaid will not have a material impact on our 2013 earnings performance. As you will recall from our last earnings call, I highlighted that we were warranted expansion to our existing prisons in the state of Nebraska just that went live on July 1. The contract is off a great start as we added nearly 40,000 members according to the initial data out of approximately 60,000 new eligibles. This brings us to approximately 90,000 members today statewide with the #1 market share. We also expanded in Virginia effective July 1 as the state expanded in the Southwest region where Coventry has been awarded 7,000 new members. And finally, in Florida we recently re-awarded a contract as of the states healthy kids Medicaid program to 16 counties serving approximately 20,000 members, which is generally consistent with our presence today. We participate in multiple programs in the Florida Medicaid market and view this rebid as an encouraging sign as we think about further expansion programs as the state is for 2013 and beyond. We are also successful on our rebid efforts in Missouri, which is Coventry's largest Medicaid state by membership and has been performing well throughout 2012 this contract was effective July 1 and initial open enrollment results yielded growth of an additional 25,000 members to solidify our #1 presence statewide. This out steady momentum across our Medicaid businesses, puts us on pace to exceed our 1 million member goal during the third quarter of the year. 
With that being said, we were unsuccessful in 1 big during the second quarter, as we will not be renewing our contract with the Kansas Medicaid program, which is scheduled to end on December 31 of this year. Contract terms offered by the state were very complex in nature and present a unique challenge for Managed Care Organizations. The bid prudently based on the data that was available, most of which was our own experience, as well as requirements that the stateless putting forth for the new contract. Although our contract terminated on June 30 this year, we've been able to reach an agreement to provide managed care services through the remainder of the year at an acceptable rate. Because this contract was held by recently acquired Family Health Partners subsidiary we took an impairment charge in the second quarter of the $7.7 million or $0.03 per share to write-down certain intangibles associated with the Kansas portion of FHP. Just to remind you, the Kansas Medicaid contract represented approximately $350 million annual revenue with a year-to-date MLR into the 90s such that it was essentially a breakeven contract. While we are disappointed with the opportunity we remain quite optimistic about the growth trajectory for our Medicaid business in total and the growth initiatives that we have on the horizon. 
Turning to our Medicare business. Medicare Advantage continues to see favorable trends and we added 3,000 members during Q2. The second quarter MLR of 84.1% is in line with expectations and is consistent with our full year MLR guidance of low to mid-80s, excluding the impact of the RADV reserve release. As Allen mentioned, we have submitted our 2013 bids and I'm confident that we are well-positioned both operationally and financially to servicing the population in the future. Our Medicare Part D business experienced very impressive sequential growth during the second quarter as the 36,000 members that we added was the best growth in the entire industry. The year-to-date Medicare Part D MLR of 92.5% is consistent with our 2011 year-to-date MLR performance and keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance of low to mid-80s. Similar to my commentary on Medicare and Managed, I like our positioning in the 2013 Medicare Part D bids in light of these continued stable results. 
Moving onto the Commercial business, this morning we reported MLR of 83% for the second quarter, and 81.5% year-to-date. As you saw on the commentary in our earnings release, there's 1 specific item as automatically pushing out this result relative to 2011 but importantly does not significantly impact overall earnings profile of the Commercial Risk business. We've been able to implement capacity initiatives in the majority in the majority of our geographic areas across both large and small group business in 2012, which is an important strategy to create a more appropriate comparison in the minimum MLR definitions. The affect of this process on a GAAP financial though, is to mathematically reduce revenue for the broker commission component that otherwise would've been reported in our risk revenue total, which increases our MLR this year as compared to the prior year. There are of course many other moving parts in this nearly $6 billion block of business but I thought it would be instructive to spike up this specific factor, which drives our slightly higher Commercial Risk MLR result without a material impact to the overall earnings profile of the business. During this item our full year is now 81.5% to 82.5%, which at the midpoint is an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Staying in our commercial book, once again our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points. We continue to see trends in the high 7s looking into the rearview mirror, which migrated higher from the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010. Unit cost trend was continuing to be the largest driver of overall trend, is stable. As we look at trend by component in the second quarter, we saw the trend for inpatient days were 1000 remains slightly negative and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive. Perspective position trends appear to have stabilized after showing some slight uptick over the last few quarters while the other utilization trends that we're seeing in the outpatient category continue to take up towards. This various trend dynamics have been gradual and importantly, have been anticipated in our pricing. You will recall that we first mentioned seeing this migration in the third quarter of 2011. 
Our fee-based business has all performed in line with expectations in the quarter and we have increased slightly for this second consecutive quarter corrected our broadly improved year across all lines of our Fee-based businesses. We continue to be pleased with our Fee-based businesses as they have consistently generated steady levels of valuable unregulated cash flow and earnings. 
Turning now to SG&A, I'm very pleased with the second quarter results that we reported today and the lower full year expense level that we have included in the new guidance ranges. Just to put this into context, in 2011 reported an SG&A rate of 16.5% of revenue, which was reduced to 15.4% of revenue in our initial guidance and has now been reduced to 14% of revenue today. This is the second consecutive quarter where we have been able to increase our overall revenue range while lowering our SG&A projection, a leveraging dynamic that we think is critical to succeed in today's environment and even more so as we look to the future. While we continue to leverage our efficient operating structure in the near term, and enjoy the benefit on the SG&A line from our broker pass-through initiatives, we are also very mindful of the investments that we'll need to make for the future and are preparing accordingly. 
I would now like to spend some time on our balance sheet and cash flow performance for the second quarter. Our investment portfolio continues to be in excellent shape and has a net unrealized gain a position of $108 million at June 30, increase of $8 million from the prior quarter. Following through on our commitment to capital towards share repurchase, we bought back 9.3 million shares during the second quarter for $300 million, which represents approximately 6.5% of our outstanding shares. Not only is this level of activity comparable to our total share repurchase activity for all of 2011 it also represents the highest share repurchase level in a single quarter in the company's history. Also during the second quarter, our board of directors approved our second quarterly cash dividend, which was payed to shareholders to record on July 9. In addition to deploying cash and repurchase shares, we completed our dividend process during the second quarter collecting $215 million from our regulated subsidiaries. We ended the second quarter with $850 million in deployable free cash at the parent, which even after $300 million of share repurchase, which combined with our undrawn $750 million credit facility provides $1.6 billion in accessible capital capacity. As of June 30, our debt-to-capital ratio stands at 26% falling well within our typical leverage levels. So as I reflect on our results for the quarter and the progress that we have made across all of our businesses, I'm very satisfied with how the company is positioned and the fact, that we are advantaged in many areas. Health Care Reform continues to move forward and while this was surely create changes in the marketplace, it will also create significant opportunities for those that have a low-cost structure in connection to the [indiscernible] we believe that we have a capital and free cash flow stability to adapt quickly and support the growth prospects that we see for the future.

So we expect that to phase down toward the breakeven as we go into the rest of the year and again, enter 2013 with no material pressure."

I think our view in commercial, if you examined our comments for the prior quarters, as I've said, it's a little tougher environment.

When the numbers are in, the claims are paid and now it's a sense -- I think it's a continuous process and I think that some of the things that developed in this quarter, we're really in a work that we did the quarter before. So I think that we have made progress. I think there's a lot more opportunities in refining our delivery system, a lot more opportunities in continuing to take better care of the patients. If you follow the media, at least 4 times or 3 times last quarter, Kentucky leads is always highlighted as the, the Commonwealth is one of the places where prescription drug abuse is the worst. So we have 50 initiatives and some of those are continuously. You're really never never finished. I just think that in areas like reduced admissions and getting observation days, which is the practice in most hospitals and I think is guidelines at CMS issued and continues to refine. We've made a lot of progress and think that revenue increase in Q4 is huge, but I think on the patient management side and admission, those will go on for a long time. We've been in business, in the Medicaid business in Missouri since 1994 and life changes. For a long time our trend was 8%, the state gave us and 8% increase and life was good and 2008, the revenue got tougher and so we continually evaluate our cost structure and how we deliver the care. And so we've done a lot of work in Missouri, which is a huge state for us, too, in terms of our contracts. We had a contract forever with the worsening University decision group that was 180% of Medicaid, which worked in the old days when revenue was easier to come by and you'd have a very broad delivery system and make a reasonable profit. That kind contract's canceled last quarter. So I want to get off the subject of Kentucky. It really never stops and a decent amount of experience, we think that we're getting closer to a partnership in Kentucky. We have better dialogue with them, this has to work for the Commonwealth, has to work for us and we think that we've made progress and we'll continue to make progress and I can't do much better than to stick our next port only but we're not going to make profit next year."

Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.65 for the quarter bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.85. The quarter was marked by significant improvement in Medicaid",1869,"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.65 for the quarter bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.85. The quarter was marked by significant improvement in Medicaid performance, sequential growth in Medicare products, continued SG&A leverage and cash deployment for share repurchase. We are on track for our 2012 EPS forecast of $3.10 to $3.30 per share and therefore, are again reiterating [ph] full year 2012 guidance. 
I'll cover some of our business highlights and perhaps, more importantly, where we feel we're headed for tomorrow. Let's start with government programs, which now represents about 1/2 of the company's revenue. You may recall from the first quarter that our Medicare Advantage business, spanning 15 states, had an excellent annual enrollment period with 13% sequential membership growth in the first quarter of 2012. 
Since Q1, we've continued to add membership each month in our Medicare Advantage business, and we're at 253,000 members at the end of the second quarter. We are well positioned in our Health Plan footprint from a cost structure, distribution and product standpoint and as such, expect to continue the growth and strong performance as we look multiple years ahead. During Q2, we followed our bids for 2013, and we're quite optimistic about the future serving the senior population. 
The story is similar for Medicare Part D. We experienced significant growth in Q1, followed by continued growth in each month of the second quarter. In fact, Medicare Part D grew by 36,000 members in Q2, averaging growth of about 12,000 members per month. We expect to continue growing throughout 2012 based on our positioning of our Value Plus product and the attractive value proposition we've been able to create for the senior population. To round up Medicare, the margins on these products continue to be on track with our forecast and consistent with prior years. 
In Medicaid, coming into 2012, we experienced substantial growth, effectively doubling our revenue to about $2.9 billion, led by the 2011 Kentucky win, the FHP acquisition and organic wins in both Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Our challenge is to manage that growth and demonstrate that we're able to improve and manage bottom line performance. 
Continuing the bottom line performance thought, I'd like to continue the Medicaid discussion with a much more in-depth review of Kentucky. You may remember during Q1 conference call, when I advised you that after 5 months of data, it was obvious to us that we had severe earnings pressure and other challenges with regard to our 32-month contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky with approximately 230,000 members. At that time, I identified some of our major problems in the areas of adverse risk selection, especially in Regions 7 and 8, lack of compensation from the Commonwealth for past due payments to hospitals due to errors or omissions in the data book and the challenge of managing the health and care of a very large population with limited preparation time. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that there's not been a managed care program in Kentucky previously and the fact that there wasn't permanent leadership in the cabinet for health and family services in the early days of the program. Our challenges were made even more difficult to litigation due to litigation from one of the largest provider groups in Region 8 that prevent us from exercising the 30-day notice of termination provision, even though our agreement clearly allowed us to do so, almost a perfect storm. 
Well, enough history, and I'm pleased to report that we're making very significant progress in many, if not most of the areas, which created a very poor financial result during the first 5 months of the contract. First, there's now permanent leadership at the cabinet level for health and family services, which is resolved within the necessary and meaningful dialogue to develop a program that works for both Coventry and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Second, we received a partial adjustment regarding risk-adjusted revenue, which we were contractually owed. And this revenue produced perspective relief beginning April 1, 2012. 
Third, we received an adjustment of pass-through for hospital payments effective on May 1, 2012, that is retrospective back to November 1, 2011. Accordingly, it reimburses the Health Plan for these past-due costs for the entire contract period. 
In the area of patient management, I advised you on the last conference call that we did identify 50 initiatives to take better care of the members and we have made, and we'll continue to make, very significant progress in this area. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is a DRG state, and we've been able to reduce costly and very numerous one-day admissions, which in many cases, we're replaced with observation periods, as is the practice in most hospitals throughout the country. 
You may also recall that we bid the business with a significant rate increase in year 2. In October of this year, we'll received a rate increase between 5.3% and 7%. The difference between the 5.3% and the 7% is that while we don't have a final, final agreement, we should receive additional risk-adjusted revenue beginning October 1 in addition to the agreed-upon 5.3% rate increase. 
And while we received the partial increase prospectively for this risk-adjusted revenue and resolved the hospital pass-through issue, we have not received reimbursement retrospectively for risk-adjusted revenue, which we strongly feel is due. We filed an appeal to address this issue and if that fails, we'll litigate the issue. 
Kind of final thoughts on Kentucky, even though we were delayed by provider litigation, we will be able to move forward with terminating providers that do not meet our utilization and quality criteria, so that we continue to develop a more efficient delivery system as the year progresses. My personal belief is, in the worst case, that Kentucky will be breakeven in 2013. And I feel that the more likely outcome is that we will have a reasonable profit on this business for 2013. 
In other Medicaid news, we're off to great start in Nebraska where our expansion contract for a recent RFP win commenced on July 1 of this year, and we've enrolled more than 1/2 of the available membership, adding approximately 40,000 members, resulting in a #1 statewide market position. We serve Nebraskans in Medicaid since 2010. We've had a Health Plan presence in Nebraska since 1998. 
We also look forward to 3 new Pennsylvania regions, which are being rolled out in a staggered fashion over the next 3 quarters, starting with the Southwest in Q3, followed by the New West and ending with the New East in Q1 of 2013. And we'll continue to pursue these new opportunities, where we believe we can bring our suit of capabilities to serve state and government program populations. 
One final Medicaid topic, which is Kansas. Based on the state's proposed terms for the new 2013 Medicaid contract and our corresponding bid posture, we did not win the state of Kansas Medicaid contract effective January 1, 2013. You may recall that FHP, which we acquired in January of 2012, operated in both Missouri and Kansas. We won the Missouri rebid earlier in the year, which is where most of the performance and value of FHP resided. And accordingly, with the loss of the Kansas contract, we wrote off $7.7 million intangible in the quarter. 
Effective July 1, we did extend the existing Kansas contract for the remainder of 2012 and what we believe is an appropriate rate increase. While suffice it is to say, we learned some lessons in Kentucky and although disappointed with the outcome in Kansas, we will not sacrifice operational or financial prudence in the service -- in the search for just growth. We feel good about the growth dynamics included in the federal poverty level expansion in Medicaid and the dual-eligible migration to managed care, and we look forward to seizing our fair share, which should be significant opportunities over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Moving onto a few comments on the Commercial business. We feel that we're well positioned for the future from a cost structure standpoint and our local Health Plan footprint, and we look forward to significant opportunities in 2014. For the past decade, we have certainly experienced some normal challenges and opportunity in the commercial book. But one thing has been constant, our cost structure, which has been sound, and the commercial business has always been profitable. 
The earnings and cash flow from the commercial business has enabled us to invest in M&A, as well as organic opportunities in government programs. And while the commercial business represents about 40% of Coventry's revenue today, we are targeting a portfolio with a balanced spread across Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial with our Fee business being a complementary part of a diversified revenue earnings and cash flow stream. I don't really have any new news on the Commercial environment, which is a bit challenging, as there are many carriers seeking membership and what I feel is the best stable pool of business and more likely, today, a diminishing pool. 
Despite the discussions and speculations about health care reform over the past year, we really never altered our focus in terms of preparing for the opportunities in 2014 and beyond. While the efforts to position Coventry for 2014 is the high-performance network model of teaming up with leading health systems and physician groups and together, we expect to deliver a superior value proposition to Commercial and Medicare members in terms of care coordination, quality, access and cost. We expect the Commercial individual market to expand dramatically over the next few years. And we feel we'll be well positioned to seize that growth opportunity as well. 
In the area of capital activity, we deployed $300 million of cash on share repurchase in the second quarter, which represents about 6.5% of the outstanding shares. And since Q2 is a quarter when we received most of our regulated dividends, our deployable cash balance really didn't change significantly, as we ended the second quarter with approximately $850 million of deployable cash on hand. 
So in summary, I'm very pleased with the positioning of our diversified business model as we look to the future. Given our exposure to and capabilities in government programs, we will continue to participate in growth opportunities in Medicaid expansion, Medicare and dual eligibles. We also expect our Health Plan cost structure in many markets to be a winner in the 2014 commercial exchange jump ball. As usual, we take nothing for granted. We work every day on cost structure and product positioning. We're committed to continuing the improvements in Kentucky. And we'll continue to use our strong balance sheet, when appropriate and attractive, for capital deployment. 
On balance, we feel very positive about the diversity of our products and our balance sheet. We've never been stronger. We're better positioned to continue positive growth in Medicare Advantage and Part D. I feel we're positioned by resources, focus, commitment and experience to make substantial new Medicaid gains in the future. 
Those are general comments. I'd like for Randy Giles, our CFO, to provide some financial details. Randy?"

This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.65, which includes a $0.03 impairment charge, resulting from the non-renewal of our Medicaid contract with the state of Kansas. This result allows us to reaffirm our 2012 full year EPS guidance range of $3.10 to $3.30 per share. I'm pleased with the results we reported today, which reflect improved performance in our Medicaid business, sequential growth in our Medicare products, continued SG&A efficiency and effective use of deployable capital. 
Our mix of business continues to shift towards more balanced levels across Commercial Risk, Medicare and Medicaid products with an important level of non-risk revenue provided by our fee-based businesses. We believe that a diversified portfolio of businesses provides a critical ability to both seize growth opportunities and provide the best positioning for continued growth and profitability. 
Let's begin with our Government Programs businesses, where I'm pleased to report significant improvement in Medicaid during the second quarter. The Medicaid MLR of 93.3% is a 670-basis-point sequential improvement was driven primarily by the significant improvement in Kentucky during the quarter. Excluding the impact of Kentucky, our consolidated Q2 Medicaid MLR was an outstanding result at 83.5% or a decrease of 340 basis points over the prior year period. Our Kentucky Medicaid business improved from 120.9% MLR that we reported in Q1 to 110.8% for the second quarter, a sequential improvement of 1,010 basis points, which was driven by favorable trends for both revenue and expense during the quarter. 
On the revenue front, during the quarter, we received more clarity from the Commonwealth regarding risk-adjusted payments owed to Coventry. While we continue to discuss the underlying methodology of the risk-adjustment calculation with the Commonwealth, Coventry began recognizing the positive revenue impact of a monthly risk-adjusted payment, with an 8% quarter during the second quarter. 
As we disclosed during the investor conference during June, a supplemental payment issue has been resolved favorably, which had a positive impact on revenues the second quarter and will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, we'll be receiving a 5.3% contract rate increase on October 1, which will provide $4 million of incremental revenue per month, plus any amount that result from continued discussions on risk adjustment as Allen mentioned. 
In terms of medical expense, we continue to make progress with our list of targeted cost initiatives and expect the fruits of our labor to resolve and continue cost improvement during the second half of 2012 and throughout the remainder of the contract. We're in continued discussions with the Commonwealth regarding various aspects of the Medicaid program that we will continue to update you on as they develop. 
We remain on track to exit 2012 with the results such that Kentucky Medicaid will not have a material impact on our 2013 earnings performance. As you will recall from our last earnings call, I highlighted that we were awarded an expansion to our existing presence in the state of Nebraska, which just went live on July 1. The contract is off to a great start as we've added nearly 40,000 members according to the initial data, out of approximately 60,000 new eligibles. This brings us to approximately 90,000 members statewide with the #1 market share. 
We also expanded in Virginia effective July 1, as the state expanded in the Southwest region where Coventry has been awarded 7,000 new members. And finally, in Florida we were recently re-awarded a contract to serve the state's Healthy Kids Medicaid program to 16 counties serving approximately 20,000 members, which is generally consistent with our presence today. 
We participate in multiple programs in the Florida Medicaid market and view this rebid as an encouraging sign as we think about further expansion programs that the state is considering for 2013 and beyond. We were also successful on our rebid efforts in Missouri, which is Coventry's largest Medicaid state by membership and has been performing well throughout 2012. This contract was effective July 1 and initial open enrollment results yielded growth of an additional 25,000 members to solidify our #1 presence statewide. This outstanding momentum across our Medicaid businesses puts us on pace to exceed our 1 million member goal during the third quarter of the year. 
With that being said, we were unsuccessful on one bid during the second quarter, as we will not be renewing our contract with the Kansas Medicaid program, which is scheduled to end on December 31 of this year. Contract terms offered by the state were very complex in nature and present unique challenges for managed care organizations, the bid prudently based on the data that was available, most of which was our own experience, as well as the requirements as the state was bidding for the new contract. 
Although our contract terminated on June 30 of this year, we've been able to reach an agreement with the state to provide managed care services through the remainder of the year at an acceptable rate. Because this contract was held by recently acquired Family Health Partners subsidiary, we took an impairment charge in the second quarter of the $7.7 million or $0.03 per share to write down certain intangibles associated with the Kansas portion of FHP. Just to remind you, the Kansas Medicaid contract represented approximately $350 million annual revenue with a year-to-date MLR into the 90s, such that it was essentially a breakeven contract. While we are disappointed with the foregone [ph] opportunity, we remain quite optimistic about the growth trajectory for our Medicaid business in total and the growth initiatives that we have on the horizon. 
Turning to our Medicare business. The Medicare Advantage continues to see favorable membership trends, as we added 3,000 members during Q2. The second quarter MLR of 84.1% is in line with expectations and is consistent with our full year MLR guidance of low to mid-80s, excluding the impact of the RADV reserve release. As Allen mentioned, we have submitted our 2013 bids. I'm confident that we are well positioned, both operationally and financially, to serve the senior population in the future. 
Our Medicare Part D business experienced very impressive sequential growth during the second quarter, as the 36,000 members that we added was the best growth in the entire industry. The year-to-date Medicare Part D MLR of 92.5% is consistent with our 2011 year-to-date MLR performance and keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance of low to mid-80s. Similar to my commentary on Medicare and managed, I like our positioning in the 2013 Medicare Part D bids in light of these continued stable results. 
Moving on to the Commercial business. This morning we reported MLR of 83% for the second quarter and 81.5% year-to-date. As you saw on the commentary in our earnings release, there's one specific item that is mathematically pushing up this result relative to 2011 but importantly, does not significantly impact overall earnings profile of the Commercial Risk business. We've been able to implement broker capacity initiatives in the majority of our geographic areas across both large and small group business in 2012, which is an important strategy to create a more appropriate comparison in the minimum MLR definitions. The effect of this process on the GAAP financial, though, is to mathematically reduce revenue for the broker commission component that otherwise would've been reported in our risk revenue total, which increases our MLR this year as compared to the prior year. 
There are, of course, many other moving parts in this nearly $6 billion block of business, but I thought it would be instructive to spike up this specific factor, which drives our slightly higher Commercial Risk MLR result, without a material impact to the overall earnings profile of the business. Given this item, our full year guidance is now 81.5% to 82.5%, which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. 
Staying in our Commercial book, once again our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We continue to see trends in the high 7s, looking in the rearview mirror, which have migrated higher from the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010. Unit cost trend, which continues to be the largest driver of overall trend, is stable. As we look at trend by component in the second quarter, we saw the trend for inpatient days per 1,000 remains slightly negative, and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive prospectively. Position trends appear to stabilize after showing some slight uptick over the last few quarters, while the utilization trends, that we're seeing in the outpatient category, continue to tick upwards. These various trend dynamics have been gradual and importantly, have been anticipated in our pricing. You'll recall that we first mentioned seeing this migration in the third quarter of 2011. 
Our Fee-based business has all performed in line with expectations in the quarter, and we have increased guide slightly for this second consecutive quarter, reflecting our broadly improved year across all lines of our Fee-based businesses. We continue to be pleased with our Fee-based businesses, as they have consistently generated steady levels of valuable unregulated cash flow and earnings. 
Turning now to SG&A. I'm very pleased with the second quarter result that we reported today and the lower full year expense level that we have included in the new guidance ranges. Just to put this into context, in 2011, we reported an SG&A rate of 16.5% of revenue, which was reduced to 15.4% of revenue in our initial guidance and has now been reduced to 14% -- 14.8% of revenue today. This is the second consecutive quarter where we have been able to increase our overall revenue range, while lowering our SG&A projection, a leveraging dynamic that we think is critical to succeed in today's environment, and even more so, as we look to the future. While we continue to leverage our efficient operating structure in the near term and enjoy the benefit on the SG&A line from our broker pass-through initiatives, we are also very mindful of the investments that we'll need to make for the future and are preparing accordingly. 
I would now like to spend some time on our balance sheet and cash flow performance for the second quarter. Our investment portfolio continues to be in excellent shape and has a net unrealized gain position of $108 million at June 30, an increase of $8 million from the prior quarter. Following through on our commitment to deploy capital towards share repurchase, we bought back 9.3 million shares during the second quarter for $300 million, which represents approximately 6.5% of our outstanding shares. Not only is this level of activity comparable to our total share repurchase activity for all of 2011, it also represents the highest share repurchase level in a single quarter in the company's history. 
Also during the second quarter, our Board of Directors approved our second quarterly cash dividend, which was payed to shareholders on record on July 9. In addition to deploying cash to repurchase shares, we completed our dividend process during the second quarter, collecting $215 million from our regulated subsidiaries. We ended the second quarter with $850 million in deployable free cash at the parent, which even after $300 million of share repurchase, which combined with our undrawn $750 million credit facility, provides $1.6 billion in accessible capital capacity. 
As of June 30, our debt-to-capital ratio stands at 26%, falling well within our typical leverage levels. So as I reflect on our results for the quarter and the progress that we have made across all of our businesses, I'm very satisfied with how the company is positioned and in fact deal that we're advantaged in many areas. Health Care Reform continues to move forward. And while this will surely create changes in the marketplace, it will also create significant opportunities for those that have a low-cost structure and can execute effectively. We believe that we have the capital and free cash flow stability to [indiscernible], adapt quickly and support the growth prospects that we see for the future.

We continue to weed out prescription drug abuse, pain center types of mills.

If you think -- if you follow the media, at least 4 time or 3 times last quarter, Kentucky leads -- is always highlighted as this -- the Commonwealth is one of the places where prescription drug abuse is the worst. So we have 50 initiatives and some of those are continuous. You're really never, never finished. I just think that in areas like reduced admissions and getting observation days, which is the practice in most hospitals. And I think it's guidelines that CMS issued and continues to refine. We just made a lot of progress, and I think that revenue increase in Q4 is huge. But I think on the patient management side and issue, those will go on for a long time. We've been in business -- Medicaid business in Missouri since 1994 and life changes. For a long time, our trend was 8%. The state gave us an 8% increase and life was good. And 2008, the revenue got tougher and so we continually evaluate our cost structure and how we deliver the care. And so we've done a lot of work in Missouri, which is a huge state for us, too, in terms of our contracts. We had a contract forever with the worsening university physician group that was 180% of Medicaid, which worked in the old days when revenue was easier to come by and you could have a very broad delivery system and make a reasonable profit. That contracts was canceled last quarter. So don't want to get off the subject Kentucky. It really never stops and with a decent amount of experience, and we think that we're getting closer to a partnership in Kentucky. We have better dialogue with them.

Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.65 for the quarter bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.85. The quarter was marked by significant improvement in Medicaid p",1873,"Good morning and thank you for your interest in Coventry Health Care. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.65 for the quarter bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.85. The quarter was marked by significant improvement in Medicaid performance, sequential growth in Medicare products, continued SG&A leverage and cash deployment for share repurchase. We are on track for our 2012 EPS forecast of $3.10 to $3.30 per share and therefore, are again reiterating full year 2012 guidance. 
I'll cover some of our business highlights and perhaps, more importantly, where we feel we're headed for tomorrow. Let's start with government programs, which now represents about 1/2 of the company's revenue. You may recall from the first quarter that our Medicare Advantage business, spanning 15 states, had an excellent annual enrollment period with 13% sequential membership growth in the first quarter of 2012. 
Since Q1, we've continued to add membership each month in our Medicare Advantage business, and were at 253,000 members at the end of the second quarter. We're well positioned in our Health Plan footprint from a cost structure, distribution and product standpoint and as such, expect to continue the growth and strong performance as we look multiple years ahead. During Q2, we filed our bids for 2013, and we're quite optimistic about the future serving the senior population. 
The story is similar for Medicare Part D. We experienced significant growth in Q1, followed by continued growth in each month of the second quarter. In fact, Medicare Part D grew by 36,000 members in Q2, averaging growth of about 12,000 members per month. We expect to continue growing throughout 2012 based on our positioning of our Value Plus product and the attractive value proposition we've been able to create for the senior population. To round out Medicare, the margins on these products continue to be on track with their forecast and consistent with prior years. 
In Medicaid, coming into 2012, we experienced substantial growth, effectively doubling our revenue to about $2.9 billion, led by the 2011 Kentucky win, the FHP acquisition and organic wins in both Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Our challenge is to manage that growth and demonstrate that we're able to improve and manage bottom line performance. 
Continuing the bottom line performance thought, I'd like to continue the Medicaid discussion with a much more in-depth review of Kentucky. You may remember during Q1 conference call, when I advised you that after 5 months of data, it was obvious to us that we had severe earnings pressure and other challenges with regard to our 32-month contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky with approximately 230,000 members. At that time, I identified some of our major problems in the areas of adverse risk selection, especially in Regions 7 and 8, lack of compensation from the Commonwealth for past due payments to hospitals due to errors or omissions in the data book and the challenge of managing the health and care of a very large population with limited preparation time. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that there's not been a managed care program in Kentucky previously and the fact that there wasn't permanent leadership in the cabinet for health and family services in the early days of the program. Our challenges were made even more difficult to litigation -- due to litigation from one of the largest provider groups in Region 8 to prevent us from exercising the 30-day notice of termination provision, even though our agreement clearly allowed us to do so, almost a perfect storm. 
Well, enough history, and I'm pleased to report that we're making very significant progress in many, if not most of the areas, which created a very poor financial result during the first 5 months of the contract. First, there's now permanent leadership at the cabinet level for health and family services, which has resulted in the necessary and meaningful dialogue to develop a program that works for both Coventry and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Second, we have received a partial adjustment regarding risk-adjusted revenue, which we were contractually owed. And this revenue produced prospective relief beginning April 1, 2012. 
Third, we received an adjustment of pass-through for hospital payments effective on May 1, 2012, that is retrospective back to November 1, 2011. Accordingly, it reimburses the Health Plan for these past-due costs for the entire contract period. 
In the area of patient management, I advised you on the last conference call that we'd identified 50 initiatives to take better care of the members and we have made, and we'll continue to make, very significant progress in this area. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is a DRG state, and we've been able to reduce costly and very numerous one-day admissions, which in many cases, were replaced with observation periods, as is the practice in most hospitals throughout the country. 
You may also recall that we bid the business with a significant rate increase in year 2. In October of this year, we will see a rate increase between 5.3% and 7%. The difference between the 5.3% and the 7% is that while we don't have a final, final agreement, we should receive additional risk-adjusted revenue beginning October 1 in addition to the agreed-upon 5.3% rate increase. 
And while we received a partial increase prospectively for this risk-adjusted revenue and resolved the hospital pass-through issue, we have not received reimbursement retrospectively for risk-adjusted revenue, which we strongly feel is due. We filed an appeal to address this issue and if that fails, we'll litigate the issue. 
Kind of final thoughts on Kentucky, even though we were delayed by provider litigation, we will be able to move forward with terminating providers who do not meet our utilization and quality criteria, so that we continue to develop a more efficient delivery system as the year progresses. My personal belief is, in a worst case, that Kentucky will be breakeven in 2013. And I feel that the more likely outcome is that we will have a reasonable profit on this business for 2013. 
In other Medicaid news, we're off to a great start in Nebraska where our expansion contract for a recent RFP win commenced on July 1 of this year, and we've enrolled more than half of the available membership, adding approximately 40,000 members, resulting in a #1 statewide market position. We've served Nebraskans in Medicaid since 2010. We've had a Health Plan presence in Nebraska since 1998. 
We also look forward to 3 new Pennsylvania regions, which are being rolled out in a staggered fashion over the next 3 quarters, starting with the Southwest in Q3, followed by the New West and ending with the New East in Q1 of 2013. And we'll continue to pursue these new opportunities, where we believe we can bring our suit of capabilities to serve state and government program populations. 
One final Medicaid topic, which is Kansas. Based on the state's proposed terms for the new 2013 Medicaid contract and our corresponding bid posture, we did not win the state of Kansas Medicaid contract effective January 1, 2013. You may recall that FHP, which we acquired in January of 2012, operated in both Missouri and Kansas. We won the Missouri rebid earlier in the year, which is where most of the performance and value of FHP resided. And accordingly, with the loss of the Kansas contract, we wrote off $7.7 million intangible in the quarter. 
Effective July 1, we did extend the existing Kansas contract for the remainder of 2012 at what we believe is an appropriate rate increase. While suffice it is to say, we learned some lessons in Kentucky and although disappointed with the outcome in Kansas, we will not sacrifice operational or financial prudence in the service -- in the search for just growth. We feel good about the growth dynamics included in the federal poverty level expansion in Medicaid and the dual-eligible migration to managed care, and look forward to seizing our fair share, which should be significant opportunities over the next 3 to 5 years. 
Moving onto a few comments on the Commercial business. We feel that we're well positioned for the future from a cost structure standpoint and our local Health Plan footprint, and we look forward to significant opportunities in 2014. For the past decade, we have certainly experienced some normal challenges and opportunity in the commercial book. But one thing has been constant, our cost structure, which has been sound, and the commercial business has always been profitable. 
The earnings and cash flow from the commercial business has enabled us to invest in M&A, as well as organic opportunities in government programs. And while the commercial business represents about 40% of Coventry's revenue today, we are targeting a portfolio with a balanced spread across Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial with our Fee business being a complementary part of a diversified revenue earnings and cash flow stream. Don't really have any new news on the Commercial environment, which is a bit challenging, as there are many carriers seeking membership in what I feel is at best a stable pool of business and more likely today, a diminishing pool. 
Despite the discussions and speculations about health care reform over the past year, we really never altered our focus in terms of preparing for the opportunities in 2014 and beyond. One of the efforts to position Coventry for 2014 is the high-performance network model of teaming up with leading health systems and physician groups and together, we expect to deliver a superior value proposition to Commercial and Medicare members in terms of care coordination, quality, access and cost. We expect the Commercial individual market to expand dramatically over the next few years. And we feel we'll be well positioned to seize that growth opportunity as well. 
In the area of capital activity, we deployed $300 million of cash on share repurchase in the second quarter, which represents about 6.5% of the outstanding shares. And since Q2 is a quarter when we receive most of our regulated dividends, our deployable cash balance really didn't change significantly, as we ended the second quarter with approximately $850 million of deployable cash on hand. 
So in summary, I'm very pleased with the positioning of our diversified business model as we look to the future. Given our exposure to and capabilities in government programs, we will continue to participate in growth opportunities in Medicaid expansion, Medicare and dual eligibles. We also expect our Health Plan cost structure in many markets to be a winner in the 2014 commercial exchange jump ball. As usual, we take nothing for granted. We work every day on cost structure and product positioning. We're committed to continuing the improvements in Kentucky. And we'll continue to use our strong balance sheet, when appropriate and attractive, for capital deployment. 
On balance, we feel very positive about the diversity of our products and our balance sheet. We have never been stronger or better positioned to continue positive growth in Medicare Advantage and Part D. And I feel that we're positioned by resources, focus, commitment and experience to make substantial new Medicaid gains in the future. 
With those general comments. I'd like for Randy Giles, our CFO, to provide some financial details. Randy?"

This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.65, which includes a $0.03 impairment charge, resulting from the non-renewal of our Medicaid contract with the state of Kansas. This result allows us to reaffirm our 2012 full year EPS guidance range of $3.10 to $3.30 per share. I'm pleased with the results we have reported today, which reflect improved performance in our Medicaid business, sequential growth in our Medicare products, continued SG&A efficiency and effective use of deployable capital. 
Our mix of business continues to shift towards more balanced levels across Commercial Risk, Medicare and Medicaid products with an important level of non-risk revenue provided by our fee-based businesses. We believe that a diversified portfolio of businesses provides a critical ability to both seize growth opportunities and provide the best positioning for continued growth and profitability. 
Let's begin with our Government Programs businesses, where I'm pleased to report significant improvement in Medicaid during the second quarter. Medicaid MLR of 93.3% is a 670-basis-point sequential improvement was driven primarily by the significant improvement in Kentucky during the quarter. Excluding the impact of Kentucky, our consolidated Q2 Medicaid MLR was an outstanding result at 83.5% or a decrease of 340 basis points over the prior year period. Our Kentucky Medicaid business improved from the 120.9% MLR that we reported in Q1 to 110.8% for the second quarter, a sequential improvement of 1,010 basis points, which was driven by favorable trends for both revenue and expense during the quarter. 
On the revenue front, during the quarter, we received more clarity from the Commonwealth regarding risk-adjustment payments owed to Coventry. While we'll continue to discuss the underlying methodology of the risk-adjustment calculation with the Commonwealth, Coventry began recognizing the positive revenue impact of a monthly risk-adjustment payment, with an 8% quarter during the second quarter. 
As we disclosed in the investor conference during June, the supplemental payment issue has been resolved favorably, which had a positive impact on revenue in the second quarter and will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, we'll be receiving a 5.3% contract rate increase on October 1, which will provide $4 million of incremental revenue per month, plus any amounts that result from continued discussions on risk adjustment, as Allen mentioned. 
In terms of medical expense, we continue to make progress with our list of targeted cost initiatives and expect the fruits of our labor to resolve in continued cost improvement during the second half of 2012 and throughout the remainder of the contract. We're in continued discussions with the Commonwealth regarding various aspects of the Medicaid program that we will continue to update you on as they develop. 
We remain on track to exit 2012 with the results such that Kentucky Medicaid will not have a material impact on our 2013 earnings performance. As you will recall from our last earnings call, I highlighted that we were awarded an expansion to our existing presence in the state of Nebraska, which just went live on July 1. The contract is off to a great start as we've added nearly 40,000 members according to the initial data, out of approximately 60,000 new eligibles. This brings us to approximately 90,000 members statewide with the #1 market share. 
We also expanded in Virginia effective July 1, as the state expanded in the Southwest region where Coventry has been awarded 7,000 new members. And finally, in Florida we were recently re-awarded a contract to serve the state's Healthy Kids Medicaid program to 16 counties serving approximately 20,000 members, which is generally consistent with our presence today. 
We participate in multiple programs in the Florida Medicaid market and view this rebid as an encouraging sign as we think about further expansion programs that the state is considering for 2013 and beyond. We were also successful in our rebid efforts in Missouri, which is Coventry's largest Medicaid state by membership and has been performing well throughout 2012. This contract was effective July 1 and initial open enrollment results yielded growth of an additional 25,000 members to solidify our #1 presence statewide. This outstanding momentum across our Medicaid businesses puts us on pace to exceed our 1 million member goal during the third quarter of the year. 
With that being said, we were unsuccessful on one bid during the second quarter, as we will not be renewing our contract with the Kansas Medicaid program, which is scheduled to end on December 31 of this year. Contract terms offered by the state were very complex in nature and presented unique challenges for managed care organizations. We bid prudently based on the data that was available, most of which was our own experience, as well as the requirements that the state was putting forward for the new contract. 
Although our contract terminated on June 30 of this year, we've been able to reach an agreement with the state to provide managed care services through the remainder of the year at an acceptable rate. Because this contract was held by recently acquired Family Health Partners subsidiary, we took an impairment charge in the second quarter of the $7.7 million or $0.03 per share to write down certain intangibles associated with the Kansas portion of FHP. Just to remind you, the Kansas Medicaid contract represented approximately $350 million annual revenue with a year-to-date MLR into the 90s, such that it was essentially a breakeven contract. While we are disappointed with the foregone opportunity, we remain quite optimistic about the growth trajectory for our Medicaid business in total and the growth initiatives that we have on the horizon. 
Turning to our Medicare business, Medicare Advantage continues to see favorable membership trends, as we added 3,000 members during Q2. The second quarter MLR of 84.1% is in line with expectations and is consistent with our full year MLR guidance of low to mid-80s, excluding the impact of the RADV reserve release. As Allen mentioned, we have submitted our 2013 bids. I'm confident that we are well positioned, both operationally and financially, to serve the senior population in the future. 
Our Medicare Part D business experienced very impressive sequential growth during the second quarter, as the 36,000 members that we added was the best growth in the entire industry. The year-to-date Medicare Part D MLR of 92.5% is consistent with our 2011 year-to-date MLR performance and keeps us on track for our full year MLR guidance of low to mid-80s. Similar to my commentary on Medicare and managed, I like our positioning in the 2013 Medicare Part D bids in light of these continued stable results. 
Moving on to the Commercial business. This morning we reported MLR of 83% for the second quarter and 81.5% year-to-date. As you saw on the commentary in our earnings release, there's one specific item that is mathematically pushing up this result relative to 2011 but importantly, does not significantly impact the overall earnings profile of the Commercial Risk business. We have been able to implement broker capacity initiatives in the majority of our geographic areas across both large and small group business in 2012, which is an important strategy to create a more appropriate comparison to minimum MLR definitions. The effect of this process on the GAAP financials, though, is to mathematically reduce revenue for the broker commission component that otherwise would've been reported in our risk revenue total, which increases our MLR this year as compared to the prior year. 
There are, of course, many other moving parts in this nearly $6 billion block of business, but I thought it would be instructive to spike out this specific factor, which drives our slightly higher Commercial Risk MLR result, without a material impact to the overall earnings profile of the business. Given this item, our full year guidance is now 81.5% to 82.5%, which, at the midpoint, is an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. 
Staying in our Commercial book, once again our view of fundamental prospective trend remains unchanged in the range of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We continue to see trends in the high 7s, looking in the rearview mirror, which have migrated higher from the very low levels seen during the second half of 2010. Unit cost trend, which continues to be the largest driver of overall trend, is stable. As we look at trend by component in the second quarter, we saw the trend for inpatient days per 1,000 remain slightly negative, and we're projecting inpatient utilization trends to be flat to slightly positive prospectively. Physician trends appear to have stabilized after showing some slight uptick over the last few quarters, while the utilization trends that we are seeing in the outpatient category, continue to tick upwards. These various trend dynamics have been gradual and importantly, have been anticipated in our pricing. You'll recall that we first mentioned seeing this migration in the third quarter of 2011. 
Our Fee-based business has all performed in line with expectations in the quarter, and we have increased guidance slightly for this second consecutive quarter, reflecting a broadly improved view across all lines of our Fee-based businesses. We continue to be pleased with our Fee-based businesses, as they have consistently generated steady levels of valuable unregulated cash flow and earnings. 
Turning now to SG&A. I'm very pleased with the second quarter result that we reported today and the lower full year expense level that we have included in the new guidance ranges. Just to put this into context, in 2011, we reported an SG&A rate of 16.5% of revenue, which was reduced to 15.4% of revenue in our initial guidance and has now been reduced to 14% -- 14.8% of revenue today. This is the second consecutive quarter where we have been able to increase our overall revenue range, while lowering our SG&A projection, a leveraging dynamic that we think is critical to succeed in today's environment, and even more so, as we look to the future. While we continue to leverage our efficient operating structure in the near term and enjoy the benefit on the SG&A line from our broker pass-through initiatives, we are also very mindful of the investments that we'll need to make for the future and are preparing accordingly. 
I would now like to spend some time on our balance sheet and cash flow performance for the second quarter. Our investment portfolio continues to be in excellent shape and is in a net unrealized gain position of $108 million at June 30, an increase of $8 million from the prior quarter. Following through on our commitment to deploy capital towards share repurchase, we bought back 9.3 million shares during the second quarter for $300 million, which represents approximately 6.5% of our outstanding shares. Not only is this level of activity comparable to our total share repurchase activity for all of 2011, it also represents the highest share repurchase level in a single quarter in the company's history. 
Also during the second quarter, our Board of Directors approved our second quarterly cash dividend, which was paid to shareholders on record on July 9. In addition to deploying cash to repurchase shares, we completed our dividend process during the second quarter, collecting $215 million from our regulated subsidiaries. We ended the second quarter with $850 million in deployable free cash at the parent, which even after $300 million of share repurchase, which combined with our undrawn $750 million credit facility, provides $1.6 billion in accessible capital capacity. 
As of June 30, our debt-to-cap ratio stands at 26%, falling well within our typical leverage levels. So as I reflect on our results for the quarter and the progress that we have made across all of our businesses, I'm very satisfied with how the company is positioned and in fact feel that we're advantaged in many areas. Health Care Reform continues to move forward. And while this will surely create changes in the marketplace, it will also create significant opportunities for those that have a low-cost structure and can execute effectively. We believe that we have the capital and free cash flexibility to prepare, adapt quickly and support the growth prospects that we see for the future.

We've been in business -- Medicaid business in Missouri since 1994 and life changes. For a long time, our trend was 8%. The state gave us an 8% increase and life was good. And 2008, the revenue got tougher and so we continually evaluate our cost structure and how we deliver the care. And so we've done a lot of work in Missouri, which is a huge state for us, too, in terms of our contracts. We had a contract forever with the Washington University Physicians group that was 180% of Medicaid, which worked in the old days when revenue was easier to come by and you could have a very broad delivery system and make a reasonable profit. That contracts was canceled last quarter. So don't want to get off the subject Kentucky. It really never stops and with a decent amount of experience, and we think that we're getting closer to a partnership in Kentucky. We have better dialogue with them. This has to work for the Commonwealth, has to work for us. And we think that we've made progress, and we'll continue to make progress.
